00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:51,958
Captain Sakaki, please respond.
We should be able to communicate.

3
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,583
My demands are to leave
Planet Tau-e immediately,

4
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,042
and abandon the emigration project.

5
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,292
Until I hear from the captain,
I'm not moving from here.

6
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:05,458
The Tau-e emigration decision was made
by the Central Committee.

7
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:09,625
Your interference will be classified
as a first-degree crime.

8
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,375
People will not survive on that planet!

9
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:16,292
If I'm a criminal,
then the Committee members are murderers!

10
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,333
Look at this.

11
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:21,042
The emigration list is made up
of volunteers.

12
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:22,542
Why do you interfere?

13
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:23,458
Shut up!

14
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:28,417
You gathered old men and women,
coerced them, and call that volunteering?

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,458
You're going to kill them!

16
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,708
All you want to do
is reduce the mouths to feed!

17
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,375
Watch your words, Captain!

18
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,875
We're communicating
through an open channel.

19
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,583
Everyone on this ship can hear us, right?

20
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:46,292
Right now, this ship is trying
to abandon the elderly people.

21
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,292
We may be low on resources.

22
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,625
But can this be forgiven?

23
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:55,125
Weren't we looking for the promised land
that would save us?

24
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:59,625
Can you really abandon the weak
and continue to hold your head up high?

25
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:00,625
Captain Sakaki.

26
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,542
I'll wait one hour.

27
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:08,375
If this ship doesn't change course,
I will blow up this shuttle.

28
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,417
I'm not bluffing!

29
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,792
Please stop already, Captain Sakaki.

30
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:24,875
It's true that we, the volunteers,
really do want to go to Tau-e.

31
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,458
We're not being chased out or anything.

32
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,958
Don't be foolish! This is suicide!

33
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,125
We've been on this ship for over 20 years
while wandering through space.

34
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,208
The young people may be able
to endure this.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,042
But for us, we're at our limit.

36
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:47,792
But... if you give up, then...

37
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,042
Haruo.

38
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,750
- ...then it's all over!
- Haruo!

39
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:54,042
It's okay.

40
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,708
At least, when I die,
I'd like to be standing on land.

41
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,083
It could be on any planet.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,917
Grandpa.

43
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:40,625
PLANET OF THE MONSTERS

44
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:50,000
It began in the last summer
of the 20th Century.

45
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,875
Look at that! It's a monster!
This is an unbelievable scene.

46
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,208
For the first time...

47
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:02,417
humanity realized they weren't the rulers
of this planet anymore.

48
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,042
Monsters.

49
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:13,500
From the depths of the earth and sea,
or even from a forgotten divine myth,

50
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,208
they kept appearing, relentlessly.

51
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,625
In order to bring an end
to humanity's prosperity.

52
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,625
The UN Countermeasure HQ
has named it "Godzilla."

53
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,708
And then, in the end,
our worst nightmare appeared.

54
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:29,708
Godzilla.

55
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:34,458
Human or monster,
it burned everything in sight.

56
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,042
The avatar of destruction.

57
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:42,292
At 2:30 EST, a large-scale nuclear attack
was launched against Godzilla, but failed.

58
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:48,208
At midnight, the EC Allied Forces
announced they have begun evacuations...

59
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:51,000
The earth collapsed
and the skies rained fire.

60
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:57,917
And then, it was not only Earth's humans
who feared its destructive power.

61
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,250
Above the UN building,
mysterious flying objects...

62
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,750
People of Earth, we are the Exif.

63
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,625
We are observers and predictors.

64
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,542
We have come to tell you of your destiny.

65
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:15,292
The time of destruction is nigh.
You must discover a path to devotion.

66
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,375
We are the Bilusaludo.

67
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:22,667
Our home planet, the third planet
in the Bilusaludia Binary System,

68
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,000
was swallowed by an accursed black hole
and destroyed.

69
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:29,958
We are requesting immigration
to this solar system's third planet.

70
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:37,000
If you accept, we promise to eradicate
your greatest threat, Godzilla.

71
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:41,917
Those from a far away galaxy, who were
after this blue planet for themselves,

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,125
didn't wait for this paradise of oxygen
and water to become scorched earth.

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,375
- Godzilla has passed the defense line!
- The walls will give us some time.

74
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,292
A3 and A5 blocks' AIs are silent!

75
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,583
- Mecha-Godzilla won't activate!
- Why won't it activate?

76
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,042
Atomic breath detected! Incoming!

77
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:02,625
The fourth armored wall is gone!
It's over!

78
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,250
We have no choice. Evacuate!

79
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,917
All units, evacuate! Hurry!

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,667
Wait! If we can activate Mecha-Godzilla,
we can defeat it!

81
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,167
We're leaving, Galu-gu!

82
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,750
However, even with the humanoids'
gathered intelligence,

83
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,667
the destroyer's powers
overwhelmed us completely.

84
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,375
Where's Mom and Dad?

85
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:37,708
They'll catch up soon.
See? That's the bus.

86
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,208
Hey, what's that?

87
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:43,625
It's Godzilla!

88
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,292
Godzilla's here!

89
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,917
Haruo! Hurry up!

90
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:34,417
I remember the flames that burned the sky,

91
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,875
and the sunken, despaired faces
of the adults.

92
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,583
We departed hoping to find
another inhabitable planet.

93
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:53,375
However, we would soon pay the price
for such foolish optimism.

94
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,208
In the frozen, black space,

95
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:05,000
this was a kind of hell
worse than our planet destroyed in flames.

96
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:14,792
There were endless days of suffering
from hunger, thirst, and cold.

97
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,750
Some fell to disease.

98
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,375
And others gradually lost their sanity.

99
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,250
Our brethren's numbers plummeted
in the blink of an eye.

100
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:36,875
Even those still living had no time
to mourn the dead.

101
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:42,625
Kindness and pride are now
long-gone stories of the past.

102
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:54,208
A fairy tale from the time we each had
unlimited access to water and oxygen.

103
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:59,583
Where are we going... and for what reason?

104
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:05,708
Must we endure the misery
of having prolonged our lives

105
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:08,208
by sacrificing others?

106
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,583
Why are we alive?

107
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,167
Why?

108
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,167
Why?

109
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,458
Were you having a nightmare?

110
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,625
So, you're here, Metphies.

111
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,833
It's also my job to listen
to a prisoner's confession.

112
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,250
So I should repent to your god?

113
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,708
I'd settle for a fake confession, too.

114
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,375
Here's the data you asked for.

115
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:54,875
Thank you.

116
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,667
You have quite the persistence.

117
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,208
I don't have anything else to do.

118
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,625
Won't you get in trouble
if they find out you're helping?

119
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,625
I have an interest in your enthusiasm.

120
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,708
Why are you so curious
about digging up forbidden data

121
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:15,000
that anyone would otherwise
wish to forget exists?

122
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,458
"Why," you ask?

123
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,208
I've also been thinking "why."

124
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:26,917
Ever since I was thrown in here,
that word won't get out of my head.

125
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,167
Why have we become so miserable?

126
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,333
Was it inevitable? A justified punishment?

127
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:36,458
No.

128
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,167
The reason we're suffering
is because we lost to that bastard.

129
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,542
We didn't fight to the end,
but gave up and ran away.

130
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,708
Everything is destiny.

131
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:53,583
We humanoids had no way
of fighting that monster.

132
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,250
I disagree.

133
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,333
And I'll show them.

134
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,875
We just needed the right strategy
and planning,

135
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,042
and humanity could have defeated it.

136
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,625
I'll prove it.

137
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,708
It's a strange thing.

138
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:21,833
Unlike the young ones, your generation
experienced the calamity firsthand.

139
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:29,375
And yet, it's as if
you want to see that creature again.

140
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:39,625
Based on the Gematron calculation,
the predictions look disappointing.

141
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:46,292
The possibility of finding
a habitable planet in 20 years is 0.1%.

142
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:50,625
If we want better results than Tau-e,
the outlook is even grimmer.

143
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,000
The lack of resources is severe.

144
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:58,583
Even doubling the discomfort index,
life will be unsustainable in eight years.

145
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,792
The landing ship explosion the other day
was a significant psychological blow.

146
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,792
- This is getting...
- Indeed.

147
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,542
We need to examine scenario number three
in a realistic way.

148
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:15,000
Returning to Earth.
It's already 11.9 light years away.

149
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:18,917
There's no precedent for traveling so far.
It's too risky.

150
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,833
Gematron's guidance isn't bound
by time or distance.

151
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,083
As long as the nuclear reactor
has sufficient energy, travel is possible.

152
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,667
According to the ship's simulator,
it requires 170% of its operation ratio.

153
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,458
I don't know if we can mobilize
the manpower.

154
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:38,583
Would it be a constructive decision
to abandon the emigration?

155
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:39,958
That's the problem.

156
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,542
If we return to Earth,
would we be able to survive?

157
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,458
It is currently impossible to calculate
how much time has passed on Earth.

158
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,792
At the very least, a few thousand years.

159
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:56,583
Since we fled Earth,
the environment should have calmed down.

160
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:59,167
It's possible it could've gotten worse.

161
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:06,125
The problem is that strange thesis
published on the shared server.

162
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:10,375
Why would that research thesis appear
at a time like this?

163
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,917
The writer remains anonymous,

164
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,958
but it contains information that requires
special log-in credentials to access.

165
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,458
The author aside, there's probably
an informant in the Central Committee.

166
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:24,792
R-Ridiculous!

167
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:31,792
There's an electromagnetic shield
under the body's surface?

168
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,417
It's not a normal organism?

169
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,792
No, its whole body is like a giant coil.

170
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,458
Is that true?

171
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:40,708
So, what happened in the end?

172
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,083
It's kind of weird.

173
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:46,583
A new Gematron code is using 80%
of the calculation server's power.

174
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:47,750
Eighty percent?

175
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,125
Isn't it the analysis for predictions?

176
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,583
Still, for a simulation, it's too much.

177
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,792
So, the rumor
of returning to Earth is true?

178
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,792
It's 11.9 light years in one go.

179
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,125
Is a subspace jump-warp even possible?

180
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,042
It's not a problem
if we use Gematron calculation.

181
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,250
I heard it directly from Navigation.

182
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,417
Gematron, huh?

183
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,333
The ship leaders turn to the gods,
as usual.

184
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:17,875
Maybe even that new anti-Godzilla tactic
was a leak from the higher-ups?

185
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,667
Man, are we going to fight it again?

186
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:25,542
It's a monster that withstood an attack
of 150 nuclear warheads at once.

187
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,875
That's 40 megatons of nucleoplasm total.

188
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:32,333
But the thesis contained new strategies
on how to fight it.

189
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:33,250
Huh?

190
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:46,833
It's me.

191
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,333
Hey, come in.

192
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:55,333
So, the Central Committee is leaning
towards going to Earth, huh?

193
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:56,958
Not entirely.

194
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,542
To give up searching
for a habitable planet

195
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,417
means someone has to bear
that responsibility.

196
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:08,917
If they're so weak they give up drifting
after only 20 years, it can't be helped.

197
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,458
Well, I do sympathize.

198
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:16,917
They haven't dealt with the loss
of their home planet as long as we have.

199
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:20,458
And then, there's your practical joke.

200
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:23,375
Obviously, it's a headache for Mori.

201
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,500
I uploaded a new version this morning.
Did you read it?

202
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:32,583
Yeah. When I downloaded it,
it already had over 400 views.

203
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,667
Though the file was deleted
three seconds later.

204
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,333
Our delinquent captain sure is popular.

205
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:44,417
When there's rumor of returning to Earth,
we get more talk of Godzilla.

206
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:47,458
It's effective for ridiculing
the Central Committee.

207
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,917
Haruo is unaware of
the Central Committee's expectations.

208
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,542
He was researching Godzilla
purely for personal interest.

209
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:01,000
But this thesis has content that will
support our plan to return to Earth.

210
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,708
Its claim is that
Godzilla can be defeated by human hands.

211
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:10,333
If you can't understand its contents,
it just sounds like crazy prattling.

212
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,833
Earthlings harbor that much fear
of Godzilla.

213
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,708
So, do you think
it's just crazy prattling?

214
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,083
This analysis report?

215
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,208
No, it's actually quite interesting.

216
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,500
So much so, I think better of him.

217
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:28,917
Godzilla is not invincible.

218
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:32,583
It's humanity's fault for giving up
on the fight.

219
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,708
That's what Haruo thinks.

220
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,458
He analyzed that old data because
of you Exifs' Gematron calculation.

221
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,750
It was impossible for Earthlings
at the time.

222
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,458
Are you saying that, if the weak-point
analysis had been made in time,

223
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,958
that humanity
still wouldn't have been victorious?

224
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,875
And if they did defeat Godzilla,

225
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:01,833
then it was only a matter of time
until Exif's cult took over Earth.

226
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:06,083
Even if Bilusaludo's Mecha-Godzilla
had defeated Godzilla,

227
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,458
no one knows
who it would have bared its fangs at next.

228
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:17,083
However, we failed in the construction
of Mecha-Godzilla.

229
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:20,583
And you couldn't brainwash Earthlings
with your religion.

230
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,250
That's history now.

231
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,708
The what-ifs are only fairy tales.

232
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,750
Subspace jump-warp procedure,
now entering phase two.

233
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,000
Activating shields for all ship sections.

234
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,417
Bypassing electricity
for the gravitational coil engine.

235
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,750
Initiating Gematron calculation
and gravitational coils controller.

236
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,708
Begin cluster connections with Gematron
calculation crystal and central AI.

237
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,208
Gravitational coil engine
for all sections functioning normally.

238
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,500
Preparations for spin complete.

239
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,667
Subspace coordinate system render
will be displayed on the central hologram.

240
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,500
Attention all personnel.

241
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,250
This ship, Aratrum,
will soon initiate subspace jump-warp.

242
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:06,750
Estimated emergence coordinates are near
the solar system's third planet, Earth.

243
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,667
Based on the ship's time,
22 years have passed since our departure.

244
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,167
This subspace jump-warp
will be the longest we've traversed.

245
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,792
Finally. The real Earth!

246
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,375
I wonder if we can see the ocean?

247
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,000
That'd be awesome if we can!

248
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:25,625
The longest? Is this really safe?

249
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:29,292
...no idea what changes
Earth's environment has undergone.

250
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,542
After an investigation,

251
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:35,250
if we conclude the environment
has become unfit for human survival,

252
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,958
we will collect resources...

253
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,333
Hey, is the real Earth
prettier than the hologram?

254
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:42,208
Yes, it is.

255
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,250
Entering Gematron-predicted coordinates.
Suspending main propulsion drive.

256
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:49,875
We now have all the Gematron numbers.

257
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,083
Irrational numbers converted to integers.
Computing time-space recon point.

258
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:57,167
Chances of a wormhole appearing is 440%
in a simulated observation.

259
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,667
Releasing gravitational coil output
for each section of the ship.

260
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,625
Maximum spin.

261
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,542
Captain, on your order.

262
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,500
Initiate jump-warp.

263
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,875
Jump-warp initiated. Commence shift
into phase one space travel.

264
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,083
Gravitational coil at max speed,
running stable.

265
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:43,875
Arriving at launch point
required for final trajectory.

266
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,500
Breaking through subspace.

267
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:14,833
Amazing.

268
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,375
Hey, it's really blue!

269
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,583
- That's the ocean?
- It's beautiful.

270
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,167
That's Earth?

271
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,917
Yes, that's right.

272
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,458
It really is blue!

273
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:27,500
To think that I'd see it again.

274
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,875
Disabling shields in all sections.
Normal travel mode stable.

275
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,667
Distance from Earth, 1,800 kilometers.

276
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:37,625
Recalculating low orbit entrance errors.

277
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:47,458
Our Earth that was taken from us.

278
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,000
Orbit errors corrected.

279
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,000
Now entering low Earth orbit.

280
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:58,250
If we can't land on Earth,
we'll have a revolt on our hands.

281
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:00,833
It's too soon to be pessimistic.

282
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:03,750
Let's just wait for the scouting report.

283
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,250
Unmanned recon drones
launching in sequence.

284
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:13,708
All drone feedback systems are stable.

285
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,042
Begin dispersion to specified areas
for surveillance.

286
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:24,125
Entering the stratosphere.
Drone temperature stable.

287
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:28,250
Altitude 30,000 meters, beginning descent.

288
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:33,125
Altitude 15,000 meters,
entering the troposphere.

289
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:36,292
Stellar observation parallax calculated.

290
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,625
Elapsed time for the solar system
is approximately 10,000 years.

291
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,167
It's been 10,000 years? That long?

292
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,875
It's more than I imagined.

293
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:45,667
This could be good news.

294
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,042
With that much time,
the ecosystem must have changed.

295
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,167
Not even Godzilla...

296
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:51,375
I wonder.

297
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:54,042
It's possible it could've multiplied.

298
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:57,000
That thing is a genetic aberration.
It's impossible!

299
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:01,208
Recon drones are at a scouting altitude
of 2,000 meters.

300
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,583
Receiving visuals.

301
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,292
Drone six displaying sound signal monitor.

302
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,750
Just the sound of the wind?

303
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:13,125
We can't see anything.
Can you lower the altitude?

304
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,500
All drones descending.

305
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:18,417
There are thick particles floating
in the atmosphere.

306
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,125
Average visibility less than 300 meters.

307
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,958
This is...
Picking up electromagnetic interference.

308
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,917
This isn't just a normal fog.

309
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,292
Switching drones to sensor monitors.

310
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,708
Each drone's altitude at 500 meters.

311
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,708
Atmospheric density is increasing.

312
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,417
Further descent by remote is impossible.

313
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,542
Is this a forest?

314
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,417
Or some kind of complicated terrain.

315
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,750
Can you increase the scan power?

316
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,125
Its reflection is diffused,
so this is the limit.

317
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,042
What's that?

318
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:54,833
It's moving.

319
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,875
Drone six,
switching to sound wave reconnaissance.

320
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:01,625
Temperature around drone six
is increasing drastically!

321
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,292
- What?
- What's happening?

322
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,458
Drone six, lost!

323
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,167
Estimated energy output around drone six
approximately 180 gigawatts.

324
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:22,000
High probability of high-energy
electron particles, or atomic breath!

325
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:28,917
M-Maybe it was thunder or...

326
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,333
Idiot! No one would ever forget that roar!

327
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:38,083
Damn it. It's still on this planet.

328
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,750
You're there, aren't you?

329
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,125
You're still there!

330
00:24:56,667 --> 00:25:00,792
If the characteristics match this closely,
then that was Godzilla,

331
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:04,375
or a threat similar to it,
and it must be eliminated.

332
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:10,542
Our one advantage is that it acts
independently rather than in a pack.

333
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,917
How can you say that for sure?

334
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,958
The concentration of radiation.

335
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:21,458
As you're aware, Godzilla is a creature
that scatters heavy radiation in its wake.

336
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,958
However, even though the terrain
has undergone change,

337
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:29,667
the toxins present in the atmosphere
are maintaining stable numbers.

338
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,667
If we reverse calculate the emission data
gathered in the past three days,

339
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,500
multiple Godzillas seem unlikely.

340
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:41,750
Even now,
Godzilla is a unique genetic defect

341
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:46,417
and cannot be considered
a normal living creature, is what I mean.

342
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,750
However, it's been 10,000 years.
How can it still be alive?

343
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:54,917
There are cases where lotus seeds survived
for 2,000 years.

344
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:59,667
It also may be repeating cycles
of dormancy every few thousand years.

345
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:02,625
Or, over 10,000 years,
it could have multiplied

346
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:06,833
and diminished in number,
with this being the last surviving one.

347
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:12,542
Godzilla's biology is beyond
every known aspect of life science.

348
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:16,833
And we can't ignore the possibility
that it could be immortal.

349
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:20,583
Studies and research
aren't this meeting's main subject.

350
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:24,292
We humanoids cannot coexist with Godzilla.

351
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,000
However, if that is indeed Godzilla,
and the last one,

352
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,333
then there is only one option.

353
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,167
Complete extermination.

354
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,750
Are you utterly insane?

355
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:43,000
As you are all aware,
we have drafted anti-Godzilla strategies.

356
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:46,667
You mean that anonymous thesis?

357
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,875
We don't even know who wrote it!

358
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,625
It's from a specialist's investigation.

359
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:56,208
It's deemed as promising information.

360
00:26:56,417 --> 00:27:03,125
I am also prepared to release the name
of the person who wrote it, right here.

361
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,333
However, there are conditions.

362
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,917
And what would those conditions be?

363
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,708
To drop the charges regarding
the stolen secret information, and then...

364
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,708
release Captain Haruo Sakaki on bail.

365
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,667
Captain Sakaki? It was him?

366
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,917
You got us, Metphies.

367
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:28,583
All shall be according to God's will.

368
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,458
It's your turn.

369
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,333
Haruo.

370
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:52,458
It's here. This waveform is generating
the electromagnetic metamaterial.

371
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:57,542
Since each of Godzilla's cells
can function as a powerful electromagnet,

372
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,083
it emits a high-output,
high-frequency electromagnetic pulse

373
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:04,083
and generates
an asymmetrically permeable shield.

374
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,625
A physically impervious shield?

375
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:11,083
It may be enormous,
but can a creature even do that?

376
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:15,292
And if that were true,
how can we even begin to fight it?

377
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:20,083
It's only for about 1/10,000 of a second,
but it emits a noise periodically.

378
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:23,333
If we use an interference wave,
we can amplify that noise

379
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:28,417
to fracture the metamaterial,
and we'll target that point.

380
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:33,875
So by attacking a single point,
we can take that colossal thing down?

381
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:37,917
There should be an organ
amplifying the electromagnetic pulse.

382
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,958
If we destroy that,
we can neutralize the shield.

383
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,500
And where is it?

384
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:43,792
Unknown.

385
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,167
There isn't enough data
in our visual records.

386
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:51,625
We need to observe Godzilla
and analyze the emission pattern.

387
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,792
As you know from past battles,

388
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,625
we can confirm Godzilla has
tremendous regenerative abilities.

389
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:04,000
The destroyed organs will regenerate, and
in the seconds before the shield goes up,

390
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:08,542
we need to shove an EMP probe
into its body and destroy it from within.

391
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:12,375
The main issue with this operation
is the changed atmosphere,

392
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:15,208
and the electromagnetic wave interference.

393
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:18,167
To observe and find Godzilla's weak point,

394
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,167
we need detailed coordination
with accurate attacks,

395
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,667
so close quarters combat is required.

396
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:25,375
And for each process,

397
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:28,583
we need manpower,
otherwise we cannot succeed.

398
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:29,792
Preposterous!

399
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:34,208
Even if we gather all the races,
there are only 4,000 of us.

400
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,667
I cannot approve an operation
where lives can be lost.

401
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,458
Captain Sakaki.

402
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:41,292
I'll be blunt.

403
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:46,250
In order for your operation to work,
how many people do you need?

404
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:50,958
Combat engineers, infantry,
and special forces, so three battalions.

405
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,708
If I form two companies from each,

406
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,000
we're looking at about 600 people.

407
00:29:57,792 --> 00:29:59,167
Out of the question.

408
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:07,625
Those who do not fight,
know not how to fight evil.

409
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:11,917
Those gathered now, unified as one,
shall come to know God's mercy.

410
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,667
Give praise to God.
All shall lead down the devoted path.

411
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:21,333
Garbetrium guidance be with you all.

412
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:27,458
This is Colonel Elliot Leland,
commander of the Earth Landing Brigade.

413
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,833
Everyone, continue your tasks and listen.

414
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:34,542
All 600 gathered here
are the chosen elite forces

415
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:39,458
who have decided to give their lives
to fight against Godzilla.

416
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,792
Everyone correctly understands

417
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:48,833
that there will be no constructive outlook
if you're trapped in an old society.

418
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,458
Instead of a fake promised land,

419
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,125
we will take back our homeland,

420
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:57,458
and promise prosperity
to the next generation.

421
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:02,958
For the sake of humanity's future,
I look forward to everyone's efforts.

422
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,708
All assembled landing ships
have exited the gates.

423
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,083
Now closing the first launch gate station.

424
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:24,750
That speech sounded like you wanted
to pick a fight with the Committee.

425
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:27,208
Hey, Haruo.

426
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:32,375
Didn't you also want to get
the Committee members frustrated?

427
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:37,208
With the current system,
those members will just dry up and die.

428
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,375
There aren't any comfortable chairs
for us.

429
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,708
But if we defeat Godzilla,
then the story will be different.

430
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,250
A new hero will arrive.

431
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,375
Our era will come.

432
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:51,750
A hero, huh?

433
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:54,375
You're just like when you were a kid.

434
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:59,292
Don't take it the wrong way.
You're still on bail status.

435
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:02,750
We went through a lot
just to get you back out.

436
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:03,667
Commander.

437
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:07,250
All landing ships have assembled
in low orbit.

438
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,250
All ships, enter in sequential order.

439
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,167
Roger.

440
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,250
All ships,
begin entry in sequential order.

441
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,625
Ship ten, ignite engine.

442
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,458
Deploy anti-aerodynamic drag
and heat shield.

443
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:27,083
You look unhappy.

444
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,625
Even though your wish is being granted.

445
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:32,792
I wonder if everything will go
according to plan.

446
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:37,417
It'll be okay. As long as we have the hero
who will guide them.

447
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,292
Are you a Leland sympathizer?

448
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,625
Well, the one I put my hope in
is you,

449
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,167
Haruo.

450
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,208
The one true path to glory
can only be opened through devotion.

451
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,708
This is our, the Exif's, creed.

452
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:59,583
There are only a few Earthlings
who embody that.

453
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,542
You're a rare exception.

454
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:05,167
You overestimate me.

455
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:09,750
You are the one who is worthy
of fighting Godzilla.

456
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,750
The time will come soon enough
when that can be proven.

457
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:25,958
Ship temperature stable.

458
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,083
Passing the stratosphere.

459
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,875
Altitude 30,000 meters.

460
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:34,750
Igniting arc jet thrusters for cruising.

461
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:49,083
Once we go under those clouds,
we won't see the sun anymore, huh?

462
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:52,042
This planet has been
completely changed, too.

463
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,167
Now entering the troposphere.

464
00:33:56,667 --> 00:34:00,583
Altitude 2,000. All ships,
begin navigating towards landing zone.

465
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,333
The visibility's terrible.

466
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,167
Switching the ship's probes to ultrasonic.

467
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,958
Begin image processing.

468
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,750
Company A, landing zone confirmed.

469
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,333
Obstacles detected.

470
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:17,542
As the reconnaissance drones reported,
this is a thick forest.

471
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:21,375
Securing landing point now.
Prepare the thermobaric bombs.

472
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,917
Roger. Dropping thermo-pressure warheads.

473
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,958
They're being grandiose over there.

474
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:41,167
Well, the special forces will land
on impeded terrain.

475
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:42,792
What?

476
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,917
An obstacle collided
with the ship's exterior.

477
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:49,333
No issues so far with power and steering.

478
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:51,000
An obstacle?

479
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:04,833
Lieutenant Colonel Galu-gu,
Company E has also landed.

480
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:08,292
We will now set
the combat engineers' traps.

481
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,208
Okay.

482
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,333
The old Tanzawa Pass, huh?

483
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:17,167
If it was sunny,
it would've been beautiful.

484
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:21,792
With this heavy fog,
a visual battle would be impossible.

485
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:26,375
Lieutenant Colonel Galu-gu, please look.

486
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,375
This is...

487
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,208
Doesn't it look like
something scratched it?

488
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:33,708
I hope the others are okay out there.

489
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,292
Get the transmission balloons!

490
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:40,083
You don't need to unload
the medical supplies.

491
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,375
Transmission balloon reception favorable.

492
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:56,750
Companies B and C special force units
will reach their destination on schedule.

493
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:02,250
Companies D and E will deploy artillery
as the combat engineers lay down traps.

494
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:06,083
Okay, the first battle formation
is going according to plan.

495
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:11,042
Whichever company finds Godzilla first,
open fire with the special forces.

496
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:13,042
Provoke it and divert its course.

497
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:18,708
What's important is to observe Godzilla's
electromagnetic waves when it's attacked.

498
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:24,167
We'll analyze this data to see which organ
emits the electromagnetic wave.

499
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,833
Once we destroy that, we can neutralize
the asymmetrically permeable shield.

500
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:33,667
And finally, we'll chase Godzilla
into this Tanzawa Pass,

501
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,708
and slow it
with traps set by the engineers.

502
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:40,167
The artillery unit will then open fire
from a close range.

503
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:45,542
We'll amplify the pulse noise,
attack all at once, and destroy the organ.

504
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:51,500
The shield will go down for a few seconds,
and then we'll use EMP probes to end it.

505
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:56,667
If we can't find the amplifying organ,
we can't place the infantry.

506
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:57,958
Exactly.

507
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:02,917
The special forces analysis of the pattern
will influence the plan.

508
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:08,000
So they'll spread out into a wide area,
and advance while analyzing the enemy.

509
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:09,792
Cooperation is key.

510
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:15,667
But who knew we'd have to rely
on something this pathetic to communicate?

511
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:19,625
If we can transmit
through this convection cloud,

512
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:23,958
the drones in the stratosphere will relay
our communication with no issues.

513
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:28,000
But in this fog,
electronic communication will be limited.

514
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:31,333
What is going on
with this planet's atmosphere?

515
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,083
That's what we're trying to find out.

516
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:37,708
Colonel, I'd like to form
an investigation team.

517
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:40,625
If I can borrow three teams, as planned.

518
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:44,375
The scouting team takes priority.
I'll give you two teams.

519
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,083
All right, then.

520
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:50,958
I'd like to go, too. I want to see with
my own eyes how this terrain has changed.

521
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:52,208
You heard him.

522
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:55,167
- Master Sergeant Yuko Tani, you're up.
- Yuko?

523
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,667
You'll be his handler.
As you know, he's been released on bail.

524
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:06,000
So be careful handling him.

525
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,208
Understood.

526
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:31,375
Unbelievable. Are these really the plants
growing on Earth?

527
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:35,167
Is this what I saw in the ship's records?
Trees, was it?

528
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:37,083
They look different, though.

529
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:53,708
Don't touch it!

530
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,083
In some places they're sharp as razors.

531
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,958
It'd be deadly
if your airtight suit got a hole in it.

532
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,750
Why did you request to join this mission?

533
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:29,875
Because you're involved, Captain Sakaki,
and set up the operation.

534
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:33,417
Please don't call me that.
Just Haruo is fine.

535
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:39,958
I've always wanted to meet you
so we could speak in person.

536
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:46,458
I wondered if it's because of you, Cap...
Haruo, that grandpa died at Tau-e.

537
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,583
I...

538
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:50,917
The bombs that you brought
inside the shuttle,

539
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:55,667
I heard from security
that they were definitely all removed.

540
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,417
But then the emigration group...

541
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,375
Do you think it was an accident?

542
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,583
You don't think it was?

543
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:10,333
You said the Central Committee
wanted to reduce passengers.

544
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:14,792
They could have used some trick
so the emigration group wouldn't...

545
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:17,208
The Central Committee isn't that corrupt!

546
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,625
That's what I want to think. I don't
want to be suspicious of my comrades.

547
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:24,125
Haruo.

548
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:30,667
No, that's not it. I couldn't forgive
myself for wanting to be suspicious.

549
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:33,667
I don't want to be so judgmental
of humans.

550
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:38,667
But being on that claustrophobic ship
and living on minimal supplies,

551
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:41,500
it's normal for people
to become mistrustful.

552
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:47,042
Godzilla didn't just steal Earth
away from us.

553
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:51,500
Justice, faith, and the basic pride
we have as humans...

554
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:54,375
we've come to lose them, too.

555
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:59,667
And that's why
we need to fight Godzilla again.

556
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,667
So we can take back the dignity we lost.

557
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:11,375
This is...

558
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:13,375
Professor! Please come!

559
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:15,958
Over there!

560
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,917
Ruins?

561
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:27,917
But they couldn't have lasted
10,000 years.

562
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,500
Captain Sakaki!

563
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,333
I see.

564
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:43,167
The lichen used the building's surface
as a seedbed and became fossilized.

565
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:46,375
Afterwards,
the building materials weathered away,

566
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:49,833
but the fossilized fungus
must have retained the shape.

567
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:55,542
This is Earth's civilization.
People used to live here?

568
00:41:58,958 --> 00:41:59,958
Haruo?

569
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,292
It remembered.

570
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:10,750
Although we've forgotten,
this planet has always remembered us.

571
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:18,625
Of course. Even after undergoing change,
this is still our Mother Earth.

572
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,458
The planet that belongs to humans.

573
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:25,292
We'll take it back... no matter what.

574
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,000
With our own hands.

575
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:38,625
Where's the scouting team?
Haven't they responded yet?

576
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,000
It's probably the electromagnetic waves.

577
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:43,208
The reception area
is five kilometers, right?

578
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:44,125
Yes.

579
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,875
Unexpected atmospheric changes
are also possible.

580
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,917
There are reports of geomagnetic storms.

581
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,583
But we're connected with
Martin's investigation team. It's strange!

582
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Hey, what's that?

583
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:05,958
Is it the scouting team?

584
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:34,917
What?

585
00:43:35,792 --> 00:43:37,292
Damn it! Kill it!

586
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,708
- What?
- Something happened at the camp!

587
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,958
- Professor Martin!
- Let's go back, now!

588
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:12,250
This doesn't correspond to any
of Earth's primary species records.

589
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,167
It must be a sudden variant,

590
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:19,500
otherwise, how could something evolve
into a form like this?

591
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,042
Would living organisms
go through such a change,

592
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:25,583
even if 10,000 years have passed?

593
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:28,583
We collected
and analyzed the forest's plants,

594
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:32,958
and by using carbon dating,
I know how much time has passed.

595
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:37,875
And it looks to be within a 50-year range
of 19,200 years.

596
00:44:38,417 --> 00:44:41,000
So our time away keeps increasing.

597
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,458
The special cell characteristics of this
beast and the plants are interesting.

598
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,417
Okay, it came off.

599
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:56,583
The flora and fauna have differences,
but also similar, wide-ranging traits.

600
00:44:57,042 --> 00:45:00,125
Along with characteristics
very similar to metal,

601
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:02,958
they have bodily functions
that exert powerful magnetism.

602
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:04,625
The same as Godzilla?

603
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:10,125
Yes. This beast is small, but it may be
in the same family as Godzilla.

604
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:15,417
What's surprising is that the plants also
have strikingly similar characteristics.

605
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,417
So this fog causing
the electromagnetic disturbance...

606
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:23,000
The particles in the air
are the pollen of this forest's plants.

607
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:25,917
It could also be their natural chaff.

608
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:29,500
If the fog's caused by the organisms
and not the weather,

609
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:33,833
we have to burn the entire forest down
to disperse this fog?

610
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:38,375
So, we have no choice
but to abandon our first plan of waiting

611
00:45:38,875 --> 00:45:41,750
for the weather to clear up a bit
before we attack.

612
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,042
That's not all.

613
00:45:43,292 --> 00:45:45,750
If dangerous beasts are wandering around,

614
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:48,458
I have to split up our troops
for camp defense.

615
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:51,833
We can reassign groups
to join the special forces.

616
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:53,042
Don't be ridiculous!

617
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:57,542
You want everyone to wander in
this unknown environment without a plan?

618
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:59,042
Then what's your plan?

619
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:00,708
Retreat.

620
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:04,208
Logically, that's our only choice.

621
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:05,583
What are you saying?

622
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:09,958
The water and plants are toxic,
and the wild animals are hostile.

623
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:13,208
The only benefits here
are air pressure and gravity.

624
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:18,125
It'd be the height of stupidity
to fight Godzilla to reclaim this planet.

625
00:46:19,917 --> 00:46:22,542
This is our home!

626
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:26,542
You're giving up?
Not only once, but twice?

627
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:32,417
We can settle on the surface of the moon,
and collect resources from Earth.

628
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:36,333
If we're thinking about safety,
it's a more realistic plan.

629
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:40,875
Weren't you going to defeat Godzilla
and become a hero?

630
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:45,667
I underestimated the situation.
My eyes are open now and I've learned!

631
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,042
You're going to be a coward now?

632
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:53,333
From wild beasts alone,
we have 12 dead and 35 critically injured!

633
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:56,250
Without even seeing Godzilla,
this is the outcome!

634
00:46:56,375 --> 00:47:00,708
We can't play war with new soldiers
who've never fought in actual combat.

635
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,042
Retreat?

636
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,917
I do agree with the commander's decision,
but the problem is, how do we retreat?

637
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,208
That attack just now

638
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:15,292
left us with heavier equipment loss
than human casualties.

639
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,333
Is that so?

640
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:22,417
Frustratingly, those lizard things
destroyed four landing ships.

641
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:28,167
Ship one and two's fuel systems and
ship three and four's engines are dead.

642
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:32,042
We can't return to the mother ship
orbiting this planet anymore.

643
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:36,125
If that's the case,
we need to gather Company A,

644
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:41,542
and join the company with enough
transit power to get us all back to space.

645
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:46,375
Companies B and C are special forces
like us, so they can't do it.

646
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:50,625
So we must join the artillery unit
and the trap materials unit,

647
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:53,167
which are Companies D and E.

648
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:59,125
In order for us to escape
the wild animals' habitat,

649
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,875
we must move through
this old Tanzawa Pass.

650
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:08,667
And our first plan was to go through
the projected encounter area for Godzilla.

651
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,875
That's correct.

652
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,000
We need to pass the area
where Godzilla appears frequently.

653
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:23,375
Of course, if we run into Godzilla,
that would be extremely awful for us.

654
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:25,792
In order to secure safe passage...

655
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:30,042
We would need backup
from Companies B and C.

656
00:48:30,542 --> 00:48:35,750
However, if we join up and form a cluster,
we'll be open to an atomic breath attack.

657
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:38,250
What's the safest plan?

658
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:40,875
While remaining spread out,

659
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:46,167
repeatedly reciprocate the threat
and keep securing each other's safety.

660
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:51,250
Yes. This is, however, quite close
to Captain Sakaki's original plan,

661
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:54,375
with very few changes.

662
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:01,375
Listen here.
This is a retreat tactic, no matter what.

663
00:49:01,792 --> 00:49:04,708
We will not take any action
to lure out Godzilla.

664
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:10,083
Once all units reach the gathering point,
we complete the mission,

665
00:49:10,292 --> 00:49:12,042
and return to the mother ship.

666
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:14,875
Be careful of that crack.

667
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:18,292
Okay, that's good. This way!

668
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:22,208
There's no fuse,
but it could still explode, so be careful.

669
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:25,208
- That's a high explosive. Be careful.
- Yeah.

670
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:29,792
Company B, C, and all landing ships,
heading to Company D camp.

671
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:32,208
- Confirm landing zone.
- Landing zone confirmed.

672
00:49:32,292 --> 00:49:34,750
All ships rotate bearing
to 202.5 degrees.

673
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,083
- Marker lock.
- Roger.

674
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:38,583
So what's the situation?

675
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:40,875
Company B, Company C reserves,

676
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:45,875
and Company A hover squads
are to join with Company D and stand by.

677
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:49,917
What's going on? Is the plan a go, or no?

678
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:53,542
Based on Commander Leland's orders
to the hover squads,

679
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:56,042
special forces
will abandon the base camps.

680
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:59,875
After all units reach the final
gathering point, we'll retreat.

681
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,542
We'll follow our original path,
but we won't search for Godzilla.

682
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:10,625
So, what? Did we come down to Earth
just to display our marching orders?

683
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Company A's damage
must have been that severe.

684
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:17,625
I heard there were
smaller Godzilla-like creatures.

685
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:20,708
They were strong enough
to destroy a power suit.

686
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:24,875
Leland, that coward. If he's going
to go along with Haruo's madness,

687
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:27,708
he has to resign himself
from the beginning.

688
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:32,292
They had us design this,

689
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,042
and now we have to abandon it
because of overcapacity?

690
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:43,292
Approaching Godzilla's
projected contact area.

691
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:46,667
Hurry! We need to
get through this area quickly!

692
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:53,667
Can't this thing pump out any more speed?

693
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:57,000
By shifting parts around,
we got ship two moving.

694
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:00,000
It's all we can do to keep it hovering.

695
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:02,792
I guess I'm thankful that it's moving.

696
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:06,083
I wouldn't want to walk through
this forest at all.

697
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:08,875
Are you having foreboding thoughts?

698
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:14,250
If this ends without us encountering
Godzilla, then why did I come here?

699
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,583
Were you hoping to depend on luck?

700
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:20,333
It's fine if we're actively searching,

701
00:51:20,417 --> 00:51:24,667
but if we pass by in a rush,
then we won't even find anything.

702
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:29,917
That's if we were actively searching
for Godzilla, right?

703
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,500
You and Colonel Leland

704
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:36,417
still don't understand one crucial aspect
of that thing.

705
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:40,042
It will never let humanity escape.

706
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:44,042
Even more so if we've come to provoke it
without a trace of fear.

707
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:46,667
So, it will be searching for us?

708
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,458
Is that some divine message from god?

709
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:52,958
It's a legend.

710
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:58,042
We Exif have been wandering
through space as vagrants

711
00:51:58,125 --> 00:51:59,958
far longer than Earthlings have,

712
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:02,917
and we've witnessed
many civilizations destroyed.

713
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:09,833
Many have been regretfully destroyed
by creatures similar to Godzilla.

714
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:11,125
What's that?

715
00:52:11,917 --> 00:52:15,167
He is the punishing iron hammer
for the arrogant.

716
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:19,417
For the species who pronounce themselves
as lords of creation,

717
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,042
a divine avenger will pay them a visit.

718
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:23,750
And so, he will...

719
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:28,250
What was that?

720
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:30,083
An earthquake?

721
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:42,167
Sound wave analysis!
All units, prepare for battle!

722
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:48,542
Movement detected at two o'clock!
It's approaching!

723
00:52:57,792 --> 00:52:59,333
Evade! Evade, now!

724
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:10,125
We can't evade in time!

725
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:27,333
Run, Haruo.

726
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,625
Do as your soul cries out to do.

727
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,208
Yeah.

728
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:53,000
The propellant is leaking!
It's going to explode!

729
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,333
Hurry!

730
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:34,875
I'll get you for this!

731
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:38,792
That idiot.

732
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:40,875
Haruo, why?

733
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:45,292
He's going to record the moment
Godzilla activates its shield.

734
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:48,250
And to do that, you have to attack it.

735
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:56,750
Damn it, the electromagnetic sensor
isn't responding. Why?

736
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:01,000
What are you doing? Let's go!

737
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,917
But then, Captain Sakaki...

738
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:06,208
Then, get out.

739
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:10,125
Again! This time, at a closer distance!

740
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:14,667
Damn it!

741
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:15,667
I see.

742
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:19,458
Such light damage
won't cause the shield to activate.

743
00:55:19,792 --> 00:55:20,833
Professor Martin!

744
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:24,583
Please record this next attack
with the sensor.

745
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:26,708
Captain! What's your plan?

746
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:29,917
I'm going to nose-dive
and slam into it.

747
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:31,292
What?

748
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,500
You bastard, I will...

749
00:55:52,292 --> 00:55:53,333
What?

750
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:13,625
This planet can go to hell.

751
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:26,708
Leland.

752
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,500
Colonel Leland was killed?

753
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:58,750
Yes. According to rank,
the command will now fall to me, though...

754
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,083
Can you do it?

755
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:05,292
I'll need to reassign a subordinate
who has disobeyed military regulations.

756
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:07,875
This is an emergency,
so please understand.

757
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:12,250
For this occasion, fine.
Bring back as many people as you can.

758
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:13,708
Understood.

759
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:19,875
Did you analyze the data sent to us?

760
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:21,083
Finished just now.

761
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:24,333
The electromagnetic metamaterial's
output has been recorded.

762
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,500
Just as you surmised, a shield exists.

763
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,458
The noise in question was confirmed.

764
00:57:31,042 --> 00:57:33,000
It's not unified across its body.

765
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:35,167
There's clearly a concentrated spot.

766
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,167
The dorsal fin?

767
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:41,292
This is where the shield is generated.
Leland gave his life for this information.

768
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:48,917
Everyone, during that earlier encounter,
Colonel Leland died an honorable death.

769
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:53,708
And so,
as the Central Committee's direct priest,

770
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:56,958
I have accepted full responsibility
for this operation.

771
00:57:57,917 --> 00:58:02,250
However, I cannot say that I am
the best man for this job.

772
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:08,167
All people are born to accomplish the task
they were meant to do.

773
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:11,958
This has been established
in our scriptures,

774
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:17,125
and as I shoulder the burden of a priest,
I cannot turn my back to this truth.

775
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:22,083
With the premise
of taking full responsibility,

776
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:25,250
I will now entrust all decision-making...

777
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:29,667
to Captain Sakaki, as the commander.

778
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:33,458
Okay, Haruo.

779
00:58:34,542 --> 00:58:35,375
Your orders.

780
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:36,750
But that's insane!

781
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:52,250
The situation is dire,
so I'll skip the pleasantries.

782
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:57,125
I don't have an outlook
for humanity's future,

783
00:58:57,583 --> 00:59:02,375
and I don't have enough of a strategy
to estimate our chances of winning.

784
00:59:03,292 --> 00:59:05,292
However, I can say this.

785
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:10,708
Those who didn't yield to Godzilla
can proudly welcome another day.

786
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:14,875
This is not only a battle
to kill Godzilla.

787
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:19,417
What we are about to fight
is a humiliating future

788
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:23,167
with no choice
but to accept despair and resignation.

789
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:31,042
If we can reject and fight that,
we can once again dream of hope and pride.

790
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,333
Just as our ancestors did,
who thrived here before us.

791
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:39,667
That's right. If we don't retreat now,
if we don't show fear,

792
00:59:39,917 --> 00:59:43,500
and if we put our lives on the line,
we've already won.

793
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:46,125
All we need to do is finish it.

794
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:51,375
Humanity's 22-year-long nightmare,
and Godzilla's 20,000-year era.

795
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:57,583
I look forward to your brave efforts.
That is all.

796
01:00:09,292 --> 01:00:10,875
We'll begin our operation.

797
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:13,583
Yuko, you know Godzilla's position, right?

798
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:16,875
Yes.
It's about 80 kilometers north-north-east.

799
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:19,583
Moving southwest
at 40 kilometers an hour.

800
01:00:19,667 --> 01:00:23,375
Set up transmission balloons
every 3,000 meters on the battlefield.

801
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:26,292
- We need optimal communicative reception.
- Roger.

802
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:30,375
Major Belu-be, provoke Godzilla
from a distance and watch its reaction.

803
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:32,042
Maintain that distance.

804
01:00:32,292 --> 01:00:33,625
Sure, leave it to me.

805
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:35,958
Adam, watch for the atomic breath.

806
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:38,375
If electric potential rises,
escape immediately.

807
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,333
Understood.

808
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:40,708
Galu-gu.

809
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:44,792
I'll move to the trap point
and command the power suit team directly.

810
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:45,875
What?

811
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:50,333
I'll determine the EMP probes'
target point on-site.

812
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:51,958
However...

813
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:54,583
Galu-gu, how are the trap placements?

814
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:56,292
All according to plan.

815
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:58,833
Its weak point is the dorsal fin,
its back.

816
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:02,208
Since we need to concentrate our fire
at a close distance,

817
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:07,333
we have to let it pass the line of fire,
and lure it deeper into the valley.

818
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:09,708
So we only have one chance.

819
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:14,167
To make this plan work, we need
to place the traps deeper in the valley.

820
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,917
Artillery units are all in position.

821
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:28,125
We're ready.

822
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,250
Can we really lure it
all the way out here?

823
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:34,125
We have no choice but to believe in them.

824
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:40,833
Power suit team, move to the trap point.
We'll stand by.

825
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:45,333
I'm leaving the diversion to you, Belu-be.

826
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:46,708
Roger.

827
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:52,750
All squads, ascend to planned altitude.
Cross-delta pattern formation.

828
01:02:04,292 --> 01:02:06,500
Godzilla detected
at the projected contact area.

829
01:02:07,292 --> 01:02:09,708
All units, commence the diversion plan.

830
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:11,583
Right wing, squad one, attack!

831
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:16,417
Godzilla sighting confirmed!

832
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:17,458
Fire!

833
01:02:20,417 --> 01:02:21,375
All units, turn!

834
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:34,750
Ascend in battle formation.
We'll attack as long as possible!

835
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,083
Target successfully diverted.

836
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:46,667
We can do this!

837
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:51,583
Evade!

838
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:59,500
Damn it! Adam! Take the left wing!

839
01:02:59,667 --> 01:03:01,292
Roger, left wing, squad one.

840
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:04,333
- The impact area is bigger!
- It's hard to evade!

841
01:03:04,417 --> 01:03:07,833
The evading maneuvers
are just a second delayed. Let's go!

842
01:03:17,417 --> 01:03:20,417
- Right wing, squad two, follow and attack!
- Roger!

843
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:35,583
These guys aren't part of the plan!

844
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:36,958
What's wrong?

845
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:39,417
Major Belu-be!
It's what attacked Company A!

846
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:43,708
What? All squads provide cover fire
from a higher altitude.

847
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:47,042
Shoot them down
before more come from the forest!

848
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,292
Left wing, squad two, counterattack!

849
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:08,125
We have no time for the small fish.

850
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:11,125
Left wing, squad two,
continue the diversion!

851
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:23,750
Belu-be, are you okay?

852
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,792
It seems like you're in trouble.

853
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:30,125
Like the simulations predicted,
we should be able to lure it to the spot.

854
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:31,667
But we need more firepower.

855
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:34,625
It'll be night soon.
Can you hasten the process?

856
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:38,125
Ten have gone down.
Ammo and gas are almost depleted.

857
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,875
Adam. Do you copy?

858
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:42,542
Yes. Captain, I copy.

859
01:04:43,042 --> 01:04:45,458
- I'm reassigning you.
- What, right now?

860
01:04:45,542 --> 01:04:48,500
I'm shortening the time allotted
to lure Godzilla.

861
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:50,708
What? How can we do that?

862
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:54,958
I'll use the landing ships
for a bombardment to create a path.

863
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:57,625
What? Send the landing ships
to the frontline?

864
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:58,875
It's too dangerous.

865
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,417
If they get shot down,
how will we return to the mother ship?

866
01:05:02,792 --> 01:05:04,417
But we're already home.

867
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:09,292
There's nowhere else to return to
but here. Isn't that right?

868
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:11,667
Have you lost your mind?

869
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,875
Let's do it.

870
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:16,042
It'll be useless
to prepare an escape route.

871
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:19,292
In order to win,
we need to play every hand.

872
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:23,333
This is why belligerent species
are difficult to deal with.

873
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:28,375
Adam, select five elite pilots.
Prepare the landing ships for takeoff.

874
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:29,625
Roger.

875
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:33,292
Major Belu-be, Second Lieutenant
Adam Bindewald, withdrawing!

876
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:36,458
Hurry and go! We'll handle this somehow!

877
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:39,542
Right wing, squad one, charge again!

878
01:05:42,792 --> 01:05:44,417
Don't fall behind!

879
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,083
Six elite pilots, standing by!

880
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:00,833
We can go anytime!

881
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:03,167
Load all ammunition, even the reserves.

882
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,667
If we mess up, that's it.

883
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:05,792
Roger!

884
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:07,875
All landing ships, depart!

885
01:06:08,542 --> 01:06:12,583
Starting from Godzilla's position,
create a path until the signal is given.

886
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:15,167
Fire at will, if you must.

887
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:17,750
Eliminate any obstacles in its way.

888
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,792
Commencing final diversion.

889
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:24,583
This is the point of no return.
We'll end this, now.

890
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:29,875
Listen up, the landing ships' mobility
can't evade an attack in time.

891
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:32,667
Once you know you're targeted,
abandon ship!

892
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:34,750
Captain, you're being lavish!

893
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:39,208
Hover squads, save ammo until
the route is open. Minimize losses.

894
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:43,333
Roger. We're almost out of gas.
So there's no second chances!

895
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:46,292
Turn!

896
01:06:54,042 --> 01:06:56,083
The landing ships are almost here!

897
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:58,500
Spread out to avoid the bombardment!

898
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:04,833
All ships, drop the thermobaric bombs!
Scatter all that you have!

899
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:17,917
All landing ships, disperse! Spread out!

900
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,375
So who drew the short straw?

901
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:27,750
It's me, huh?

902
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:45,625
Okay! Godzilla is on the diversion path!

903
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:49,583
Now! All hover squads,
fire everything you have! This is it!

904
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:53,792
Roger! All squads, resume the diversion!
Increase attack frequency!

905
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:01,042
Damn it!

906
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,958
It's no good! I can't speed up!

907
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:11,167
All squads! Join the left wing!
Just a little more!

908
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:15,000
Diversion is in progress.

909
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:18,000
Godzilla is accelerating
toward the trap point!

910
01:08:18,083 --> 01:08:19,958
Haruo, please hurry and board.

911
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:20,917
Yuko!

912
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,042
Why are you here?

913
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:24,875
I've always been on the power suit team.

914
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:28,167
Do you understand?
This is practically a suicide mission!

915
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:30,292
I want to become stronger!

916
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:34,458
That's what I thought when Grandpa died.

917
01:08:35,542 --> 01:08:39,292
Godzilla entering Tanzawa Pass.
Only 500 meters to the trap point.

918
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:55,292
Damn it, I'm running out of gas!

919
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,458
Keep provoking it
and lure it to the last point.

920
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,792
Stay calm, this is the critical moment.

921
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:04,208
Trap point arrival, 100 meters!

922
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:11,167
You will return Earth to humans.

923
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:13,458
Fifty more meters!

924
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,625
Damn, I can't stand this.

925
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,292
At times like this, I'm jealous of those
who have a god to pray to.

926
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:30,000
All units, disperse!

927
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,125
Ten meters!

928
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:38,292
Godzilla is at the trap point!

929
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:40,292
Set off the trap!

930
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:51,125
Trap detonation complete!

931
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,292
Godzilla's movement stopped.

932
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:01,292
Did we succeed in capturing it?

933
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:11,458
Artillery unit, begin concentrated fire!

934
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,833
Asymmetrically permeable shield,
generated!

935
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:26,917
All gun ports, synchronized attack!

936
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:30,125
Body surface electromagnetic pulse
alignment sync at 75%!

937
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:33,333
At 75%? Is the pattern changing?

938
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:37,208
Alignment incomplete.
Unable to predict shield collapse!

939
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,083
Damn it, we can't attack like this.

940
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:42,125
Search for the noise. Hurry!

941
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:46,375
Noise detected.
The next shield collapse is in 20 seconds.

942
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:47,833
Twenty seconds?

943
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:49,625
Will the restraints hold?

944
01:10:56,667 --> 01:10:57,667
Sync at 100%.

945
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:02,042
Detecting resonance with noise wave!
Shield collapse in ten seconds!

946
01:11:09,292 --> 01:11:11,375
Artillery unit, fire!

947
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,792
If we can destroy the dorsal fin...

948
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:20,208
The shield is dropping!

949
01:11:20,792 --> 01:11:22,958
Electric potential rising!
It's an atomic breath!

950
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:26,583
It can still attack?

951
01:11:28,292 --> 01:11:31,125
The tissue on Godzilla's back
is regenerating!

952
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:33,375
The shield will be restored.

953
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:36,167
Shield will be up in about 200 seconds!

954
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,708
The restraints are no longer holding!

955
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:40,417
Damn it.

956
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:42,167
I'll finish this!

957
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:44,958
Haruo!

958
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:53,625
- What is he...
- With a close-range EMP attack,

959
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:55,750
he'll disrupt the noise pattern.

960
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:02,667
The pulse is changing. It's syncing again!

961
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:05,833
The next shield collapse
is in ten seconds!

962
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,292
Don't worry about me!
Destroy the rest of the dorsal fin!

963
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:10,708
But then you'll...

964
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:13,000
Doesn't matter! Fire!

965
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:15,625
The shield is now collapsing!

966
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,708
Fire! Fire until the gun barrel burns up!

967
01:12:25,167 --> 01:12:26,750
The shield is dropping!

968
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:28,917
Okay, power suit unit, attack!

969
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,875
The EMP probes are entering its body!

970
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:55,208
All units, retreat! Retreat!

971
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:08,458
Electromagnetic concentration
in the air, rising!

972
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:11,792
It didn't work?

973
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:15,917
It did, the electromagnetic waves
are running wild inside it.

974
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:28,333
You bastard, I have...

975
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:33,250
killed you!

976
01:13:49,167 --> 01:13:51,458
He really did it.

977
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:51,417
Haruo!

978
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:07,500
Look at this.

979
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:11,708
This body structure...

980
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,833
Yeah. Indeed a monster.

981
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,042
You've accomplished it, Captain.

982
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:23,750
Because everyone believed in
and supported me,

983
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,250
I could be so daring and get this far.

984
01:15:27,417 --> 01:15:32,292
Even though we defeated it...
What was it, really?

985
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:35,542
How was it able to live for 20,000 years?

986
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:38,542
This is just my opinion,

987
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:43,708
but I think this is a different Godzilla
than the one that drove us from Earth.

988
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:49,125
But its appearance and abilities
were almost identical.

989
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:52,875
And that's exactly why.
Life's true nature is found in change.

990
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:56,583
No matter how gradual
the renewal cycle may be,

991
01:15:56,875 --> 01:16:00,292
it's impossible to maintain
the exact same appearance.

992
01:16:00,792 --> 01:16:05,250
So this one may be an offspring
that inherited Godzilla's form and nature.

993
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:08,375
Such a guess would actually
be the most natural.

994
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,667
Although the question remains
of why there was only this one. Also...

995
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:17,875
So, there's no guarantee
only one of them survived.

996
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:22,333
I apologize if what I'm saying
spoils the victory, but that is correct.

997
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:28,292
That's fine. Thanks to this battle,
we proved that we can defeat Godzilla.

998
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:32,208
Even if another one shows up,
we have nothing to fear.

999
01:16:33,167 --> 01:16:37,708
Since we've established a valid strategy,
we can be more effective next time.

1000
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,583
Personally, I would never want to cross
a tightrope like that ever again, though.

1001
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:46,583
What was that?

1002
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:49,625
Did anyone measure the vibration?

1003
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:51,667
I'm picking it up on this sensor!

1004
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,542
Find the origin using Gematoria analysis.

1005
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:56,458
Yes, sir.

1006
01:16:57,083 --> 01:17:01,000
No, it can't be. Is the meter damaged?

1007
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,958
- What is it?
- It's within two kilometers?

1008
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:05,083
It's nearby!

1009
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:06,333
That's ridiculous!

1010
01:17:06,417 --> 01:17:09,375
Electric potential, rising.
The numbers are unbelievable!

1011
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,625
They are far greater than Godzilla's!

1012
01:17:11,708 --> 01:17:13,250
Underground heat source...

1013
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:16,542
Wait, a plasma reaction? This can't be!

1014
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:50,875
What's happening?

1015
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:06,292
Is that...

1016
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:13,208
Wh-What is that?

1017
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:14,583
Godzilla?

1018
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:17,333
Height over 300 meters and rising.

1019
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,875
Surface vibroscope estimates a mass
of about 100,000 tons.

1020
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:26,458
This is impossible!

1021
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:46,250
Can that be a living creature?
Unbelievable!

1022
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:50,917
No, according to the rules
for living creatures, this is correct.

1023
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:52,375
Professor?

1024
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:57,458
Indeed, the changing form of life
isn't just about decay.

1025
01:18:58,417 --> 01:19:04,500
If it continued its life activity
for 20,000 years, growing earnestly...

1026
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:08,542
When those fleeting lives destined to die,

1027
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:11,542
forget their humbleness
and sing praises of their glory,

1028
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:15,125
such will shake the very heavens
and split the earth,

1029
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,667
and they shall know the wrath
of the divine.

1030
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:20,333
The inevitable incarnation of destruction.

1031
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,542
So, you show yourself at last.

1032
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:30,750
Since we last saw each other, it has been
20 years for us and 20,000 years for you.

1033
01:19:33,042 --> 01:19:34,458
It's been a while...

1034
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:37,167
Oh, King of Destruction.

1035
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:49,250
All landing ships, take off immediately!
Emergency retreat!

1036
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:51,292
But we're still withdrawing!

1037
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:55,125
Just take whoever's already onboard
before that thing attacks us!

1038
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:01,167
Everyone, do whatever it takes
to get far away from here! Hurry!

1039
01:20:41,167 --> 01:20:43,542
What's that? A super oscillatory wave?

1040
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:47,875
Estimated electric output
is measuring over 900 gigawatts.

1041
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,083
Damn it!

1042
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:51,167
What do you intend to do?

1043
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,542
I'll divert its attention!

1044
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:55,792
I'll buy time so people can run!

1045
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:58,083
You don't think that'll work, do you?

1046
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:13,333
You bastard... I will...

1047
01:22:14,034 --> 01:22:19,034
