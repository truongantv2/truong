You're right.

11
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,619
That old man seems to be injured.

12
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,450
I think we should help him.

13
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,570
- Let's check him out.
- OK.

14

Sir! Sir! Are you alright?

What a stench!

What happened?

17
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,169
Just a homeless man.

18

Really?

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,780

- You just say that for days already!

Oh, I'm broke now, man!

- Do you have 4 dollars?
- No.

45
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,369
I've worked on some 80%
of new houses in Seoul.

46

- What?
- I built them.

Why? Blood?

64
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,949
What happened to you?
Have you been bitten?

65
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,860

Where is he injured?
Do you know?

73
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,409
What I meant is...
he bleeds here.

74
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,329
His neck bleeds?

75
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,900
Like he has been bitten by something.

Yes, why?

86

His friend needs immediate treatment,

87
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,530
could you let him have your bed?

88
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,409
I'll go prepare the medications,

89
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,539
would you please make the bed neat?

90
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,329
I'll go prepare the emergency kit.
You can bring him in.

97
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,860
Pardon?

98
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,249
Are you deaf?

99
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,360
Eh... it's just...

100
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,249
my friend is hurting.
He bleeds...

101
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,079
Where do you live?

102
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,780
I'm kicked out because of you!

103
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,030
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause that.

104
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,450
I just hope for some
medics to check on him!

105
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,159
- I'm sorry...
- Get lost!

106
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,400
Get out!

107
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,820
- Stupid ass.
- Fool!

108

Really bad!...

I've told you that I won't do it!

117
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,199
Not so loud!
We're in a public place!

118
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,199
That's annoying...

119
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,249
Then go outside!

120
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,449
I'm going to call the police!

121
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,749
Hey! Hey!

122
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,249
I'm fed up! What a bum!

123
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,700
Hye-sun! Hey!

124
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,159
Come out here, damn you!

Coming!

126
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,619
That's embarrassing,
what happened?

127
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,789
You have found nothing better than
to turn me into a whore?

128
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,579
- I'm serious...
- Then what?

129
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,289
How to pay for the rent?

130
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,369
We don't even have enough
to pay for the cyber-café site!

131
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,539
About being a whore on the cyber-café site,

132
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,949
I told you I would not
do it again.

133
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,539
- So what?
- What?

134
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,449
You like to sleep under the bridges?

135
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,789
Go to the train station,
ask the homeless

136
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,329
and join them. They know
how to keep you warm!

137
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:39,199
You said you're gonna get
a part-time job, right?

138
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,619
Even if I work the whole month, we still
won't make enough to pay the rent!

139
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,699
Because you waste your time
at the cyber-café.

140
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,789
Hye-sun, just this month, OK?

141
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,579
You always said
"just this month"!

142
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,369
You don't have to sleep with them,

143
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,039
just steal their money
when they are taking the shower.

144
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,079
And it's in your pocket!

145
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,249
Anyway, you better do something!

146
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,749
I will get a job next month, OK?

147
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,039
How?

148
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,699
You know my pal,
the guy with a tattoo?

149
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,449
He works as a bouncer

150
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,829
for the club with a dome

151
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,949
at the Korean House.

152
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,789
He can hire me.

153
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,650
We can be happy,
Hye-sun, please!

154
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,650
No way!

155
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,740
I won't do it anymore! Never!

156
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,490
What are you talking about, damn it?

157
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,070
Your body is made of sugar or not?

158
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,079
It melts when being kissed?

159
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,749
Answer me.

160
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,780
Do not hit me, asshole.

161
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,449
You think you're strong!

162
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,289
No need to go back tonight.

163
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,320
Wait...

164
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,579
You want me to say it?

165
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,789
You ran away from home
and lived on the street.

166
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,949
I've taken you in,

00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,159
Where do you think you are?

335
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,990
- Get them out!
- Yes sir.

336
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,070
Out! Out!

337
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,530
Jin-young! Jin-young!

338
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,320
What are... these people?

339
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,159
Sir, what happened to them?

340
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,579
Oh my god!
They just cannot stay...

341
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,360
- What, these people?
- Go find out, idiot.

342
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,320
Calm yourself and follow me!

343
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,320
<i>Come on!</i>

344
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,610
<i>Move your ass!</i>

345
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,900
Hit him! On the head!

346
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,530
A little more, catch my hand!

347
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,780
What's this, holy shit?

348
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,949
Call Hye-sun!

349
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,950
Call her now!

350
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,150
No answer! Her phone is dead!

351
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,610
Shit!

352
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,990
Let's go to the car, for now!

353
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,450
Raise your ass!

354
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,950
Over there!

355
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,530
Calm yourself!

356
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,110
Come to your senses!

357
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,950
Look over there!

358
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,110
Compose yourself and look!

359
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,539
Do you see the car?

360
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,409
Descend through this roof,

361
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,400
and draw them into the alley.

362
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,320
No, I can't!

363
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,110
Listen well, you asshole!

364
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,820
Attract their attention by shouting.

365
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:14,030
Attract them.

366
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,499
I'll take the car and
run to the main street.

367
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,240
You run through the alley to there.

368
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,329
I'll meet you there, understand?

369
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,820
No, I'll get myself killed!

370
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,570
We have no choice.
Otherwise we both will be dead!

371
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,570
Pity...

372
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,650
What are these people?

373
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,159
This is the post of Seoul Train Station!

374
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,249
The homeless are attacking other people!

375
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,699
There are many victims!

376
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,999
Requesting arm force backup!

377
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,039
I repeat. The homeless
have become lunatic.

378
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,949
There are many victims,
many victims!

379
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,409
Hey! We have nothing to do with that!

380
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,659
These monsters suddenly attacked us!

381
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,539
Don't move, asshole!

382
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,530
Son of a bitch... Don't move!

383
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,079
Sir, I'm not a homeless person!

384
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,400
Help me, please.

385
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,070
- You whore!
- I beg you, help me!

386
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,409
Bitch!

387
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:47,650
Don't move, or I'll take you down!

388
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,490
Dirty monsters, I'll kill you all!

389
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,240
Have attention!

390
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,700
Jump!

391
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,900
Hey!

392
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,070
Go ahead!

393
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,490
Continue, stupid!

394
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,820
OK, OK.

395
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,700
Don't stop!

396
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:36,409
Dumbass! Look where you're going!

397
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,869
Are you blind?

398
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,659
You owe me an apology!

399
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,700
Hey, boy!

400
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,280
Come back here!

401
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,320
What a stupid ass...

402
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,530
Damn!

403
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,400
Fucking shit! Damn it!

404
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,700
Main street! Where is it?

405
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,700
Shit!

406
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,150
Hop on! Quick!

407
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,820
Quick, sir! Go on!

408
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,740
Jin-young!

409
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,570
Are you OK?

410
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,740
Hey!

411
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,860
Jin-young!

412
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,990
Jin-young...

413
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,740
They can return to life?

414
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,700
Don't move!

415
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,450
Not a gesture, you bastards...

416
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,490
Don't come nearer!

417
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,110
Dirty sons of bitches!

418
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,950
Die, asshole!

419
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,400
Die!

420
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,110
Die!

421
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,280
The gun...

422
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,240
The gun?

423
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,570
Give it to me!

424
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,530
Say, mister,

425
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,789
you won't kill me?

426
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,360
Give me that!

427
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,570
2 bullets...

428
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,990
That's it!

429
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,400
We'll be all dead!

430
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,570
Ki-woong...

431
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,900
I am in trouble...

432
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,950
I am in trouble...
What should I do?

433
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,700
Ki-woong...

434
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,450
Hey, are you OK?

435
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,200
What was this thing?

436
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:56,119
If you've lived on the streets,
you must have been through many things.

437
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,650
Calm yourself.

438
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,530
Have you ever seen something like that?

439
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,650
First let's find Hye-sun, OK?

440
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,490
Don't worry.

441
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,200
That's it! It's the end...

442
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,200
It hurts...

443
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,249
What's here, holy shit!?

444
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,580
In here! Save us, please!

445
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,110
What happened?

446
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,070
Where do you come from?
Have you been inside?

447
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,280
You are not injured?
Go in there!

448
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,650
Come on!

449
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,360
Let's go!

450
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,610
Mister, mister!

451
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,610
Are you OK? Are you injured?

452
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,610
What happened?

453
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,740
Madness! They've all became mad!

454
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,070
These sick people, suddenly...

455
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:26,449
It's OK, sir. Calm yourself.

456
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,749
Breathe.

457
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,610
Lie down, and keep calm.

458
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,869
- Here.
- OK.

459
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,110
Breathe.

460
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,530
Very well.

461
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,610
Relax.

462
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,079
Is that your blood?

463
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,030
<i>21 Missed calls: Ki-woong</i>

464
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,650
Hye-sun!

465
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,990
Ki-woong! I'm in a mess!

466
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:04,289
Where are you?
It's the chaos everywhere.

467
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,650
Your dad is looking for you all over!

468
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,030
What? My dad?

469
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,820
Yes, I'm with him now.

470
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,450
<i>Where are you?
I'll come to get you.</i>

471
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:22,659
I'm in an ambulance,
on the way to hospital.

472
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,700
<i>Hospital?</i>

473
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,749
OK, we'll go there.

474
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,320
Don't turn off your cell phone, understand?

475
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,909
Sir, Hye-sun just called!

476
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,539
What? Where is she?

477
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,650
Hop on!

478
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,700
What happens?

479
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,780
Sick people, everywhere...

480
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:48,950
Pardon?

481
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,780
We're bombarded with calls
of victims being bitten.

482
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,079
We are in a critical situation.

483
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,449
I don't know if we can
handle more emergency calls.

484
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,400
Where are those bitten people?

485
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:05,329
They are in the emergency room.

486
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,909
They must be over-crowded,
I really don't want to join them.

487
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,990
Stop! Stop this vehicle!

488
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,409
Stop right now!

489
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:16,499
- Why?
- Because they will transform!

490
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,829
Stop immediately!

491
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,829
We must not go there!

492
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:23,039
Sir, please be calm!

493
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,200
- Don't be upset!
- They all have become crazy!

494
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,900
- Stop! Stop now!
- Sir, please!

495
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,360
- Sir! Calm down!
- Let me out!

496
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,280
- What are you doing?
- That's dangerous!

497
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,869
- Stop this damn vehicle!
- What's the problem?

498
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:42,449
What happened to him?

499
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:46,360
- Stop! Let me out!
- Release it!

500
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,490
- Sir, that's dangerous!
- Stop, I said!

501
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,240
Grab him! Pull him off there!

502
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,700
We'll get killed!

503
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,280
Son of a bitch!

504
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,030
Fucking bastard!

505
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,610
I have to run away from here...

506
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,150
We must get out of this place.

507
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,030
We have to pass through here...

508
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,610
Through here...

509
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:24,860
Quick! Quick!

510
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,740
Pass through below, quick!

511
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:54,030
Your turn, hurry!

512
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,450
Sir!

513
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:10,950
Go!

514
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:15,900
Quick!

515
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,999
Hey, you bums!

516
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,199
You are too noisy, bums!

517
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,320
You run away together?

518
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:37,530
That makes me sick!
Everyone makes me sick!

519
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:47,200
The world has gone to shit,
nothing good to live for anymore!

520
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,950
Die! Die, all of you!

521
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:02,159
Ma'am? What happened to you?

522
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,280
Don't leave me.

523
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,150
<i>No signal.</i>

524
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,450
What can I do now, Ki-woong?

525
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:10,820
Ki-woong...

526
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,280
It's too quiet.

527
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,030
Hey.

528
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:47,610
- Call her.
- Yes, sir.

529
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:54,860
I cannot reach her.

530
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,159
I'll go check out the emergency room,

531
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,530
don't go anywhere, OK?

532
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,360
Yes, I can do that.

533
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,530
Too quiet...

534
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,280
Nobody around...

535
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,490
<i>EMERGENCY</i>

536
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,360
Don't do that, sucker.

537
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,320
Mister...

538
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:16,700
Kill him! Kill him!

539
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,039
Seriously!

540
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,110
Quick! Jump in!

541
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,780
Go! Quick!

542
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,950
- Sir, quick!
- Shut-up!

543
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,700
- Try call her.
- Yes, sir.

544
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,249
Where could she have been?

545
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,449
<i>Your call could not go through...</i>

546
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,110
No connection!

547
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,780
Damn it!

548
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,990
Mister...

549
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,200
You are a man, right?

550
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,110
We have to run away,
far from here.

551
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,400
Sir, I want to go home.

552
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:41,280
I have only met bad people.

553
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:48,490
The bar has only made my debts grow...

554
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:59,320
Ki-woong, my boy-friend,

555
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:04,070
he and my dad are looking for me.

556
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:11,249
We have to run far, far away...

557
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:15,860
I got to go home.

558
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,490
I want to go home!

559
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,990
Go home?

560
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,110
Me too. I want to go home.

561
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:40,610
But I have no home!

562
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:54,650
I want to go home!

563
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,280
Daddy!

564
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,490
What happened?

565
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,950
How can we find her?

566
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:36,530
We have to find a place above the city.

567
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,030
OK.

568
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,240
Which way?

569
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,400
I think that way.

570
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,240
There!

571
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,369
We're almost there! We're near!

572
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:11,200
There must be people over-there.

573
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,650
We must go farther, much farther.

574
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,150
Oh, no! Look at that car...

575
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:28,320
There!

576
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,360
<i>Ki-woong</i>

577
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,700
<i>- Hye-sun!</i>
- Ki-woong!

578
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,659
<i>Hye-sun, are you OK?</i>

579
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:09,329
Ki-woong, help me, go find me!

580
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:13,360
<i>Stay calm, OK? Where are you?</i>

581
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,650
I am...

582
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:22,150
At Station Hoehyeon,
Exit 4, come quick!

583
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,039
What's the matter?

584
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,950
- Hoehyeon, where is it?
- Hoehyeon?

585
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,780
Do it fast!

586
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,280
There! The Hoehyeon station!

587
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:37,860
Hye-sun, we're coming,
stay where you are, all right?

588
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:42,280
How can I stay here?
It's very dangerous!

589
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,320
<i>Go find some place to hide!</i>

590
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,860
Hello! Hello! What happens now?

591
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,570
Hye-sun! Hye-sun!

592
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,400
Damn it!

593
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,900
Hey! Over here!

594
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,900
Run! Come on! Quick!

595
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,200
Climb up!

596
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,700
Be quick!

597
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:51,539
- Son of a bitch!
- Get lost!

598
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,150
Bunch of assholes!

599
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,789
Hello? Ki-woong?

600
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:07,829
Hello?

601
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,990
- Hello? Hye-sun!
<i>- Please leave a message...</i>

602
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:19,909
It's disconnected.

603
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21,360
Shit!

604
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,490
Let's search the station, hurry!

605
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:50,110
<i>This is an illegal gathering.</i>

606
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,820
<i>Disperse, or we will have to use force.</i>

607
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:05,650
<i>Disperse, or we will have to use force.</i>

608
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:17,530
That's the end...

609
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:22,030
Everything's gone to shit...

610
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:01,289
I need back-up!

611
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,650
Send all you can!

612
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,700
What happens here?

613
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,829
We have to go to Hoehyeon,
can we pass through?

614
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:19,999
Go away, go back.

615
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,999
I beg you! We have to go there!

616
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,530
<i>Stay away!</i>

617
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,820
Get lost, we're in an emergency now!

618
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:30,909
Tell us. What is happening here?

619
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:32,789
There are un-infected people down there!

620
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:37,079
That's a state of emergency!
You cannot go in there!

621
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,539
- Son of...
- Back off!

622
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:42,249
People down there could die!
Please let us go through!

623
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,949
What a pain! Stay away!

624
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,659
What a rash!

625
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,659
What's the racket here?

626
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:52,150
They want to go to Hoehyeon station.

627
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:55,110
Pardon?

628
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:59,909
Sir, my girl friend is trapped down there.

629
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:02,999
I have to look for her.
Please let us through.

630
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,650
- Just us, OK?
- Do us a favor, please.

631
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,039
We must wait for the order.

632
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,329
Please leave, all right?

633
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:16,079
You intend to let people die?

634
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,039
Please take your son and go away!

635
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,280
Make them go.

636
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:23,780
Go away, quick!

637
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:27,700
You think you are the police?
A bunch of invalids!

638
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,159
What are you doing?

639
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,700
Don't move, bastard!

640
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,700
Let me go!

641
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:40,780
Don't move, asshole!

642
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,700
- We are having a crisis now!
- Are you all right?

643
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:49,110
He has... a gun...

644
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,360
Hey, hey.

645
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:55,650
All's well!
Put away your weapon.

646
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:01,949
Listen, the whole situation
is rather unusual.

647
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:05,070
The martial law could have been declared.

648
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:11,039
Go home, and watch the news.

649
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,990
You understand?

650
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,240
Go home.

651
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,369
Get lost, damn shit!

652
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:31,030
Break up!

653
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:45,740
Fucking bitch! Go away!

654
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:53,740
You all right?

655
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,950
She bit him,
he will turn shortly.

656
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:03,150
It's just a scratch, I'm fine.

657
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:09,070
It's a small bite, all right?

658
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:11,490
What do we do now?

659
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:14,110
I'm OK.

660
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:19,610
<i>This is an illegal gathering.</i>

661
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:23,860
<i>Scatter and go home.</i>

662
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,740
Why it has stopped working?

663
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:32,700
Come on...

664
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,030
Work, please...

665
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,490
Why can't it work?

666
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,360
Forward!

667
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:27,400
On the double!

668
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,949
Sir, why you send for these soldiers?

669
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,490
What are you going to do?

670
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:39,070
Yes, sir...

671
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:42,199
The Commander of
the Capital Defense Force...

672
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,150
has taken control.

673
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:01,909
Clear out! Disperse yourselves!

674
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:03,860
Shut-up!

675
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:08,619
Bunch of bastards!
I've worked for my country!

676
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:11,829
I'm not like you,
a bunch of craps

677
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:13,650
You're all good for nothing!

678
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:23,280
I don't know why
I'm mixed up with you!

679
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:28,949
Maybe the communists
have manipulated all that!

680
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:30,610
But not me!

681
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:36,570
I don't deserve to die here!

682
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:43,780
I've dedicated my life for this country!

683
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,360
I'm a good person!

684
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:54,320
I'm someone to do good!

685
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:56,530
Go away!

686
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:58,150
Damn it!

687
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,200
I think the same way!

688
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:03,820
I've given my life to this country!

689
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:07,499
So how could I get there?

690
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,320
You know what?

691
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:18,400
This country has nothing to do with us!

692
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:23,530
We killed ourselves for our jobs,
a bunch of idiots!

693
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:31,409
But one thing's for sure.
I must survive!

694
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:33,610
I must survive!

695
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:37,950
Where are you going?

696
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:40,699
What are you doing?

697
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:42,990
Don't go there!

698
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:48,650
Get lost!

699
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,490
Die!

700
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,490
Shit!

701
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:19,070
Where's that?

702
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:20,780
Where's that?

703
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,650
Mister...

704
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:55,700
Mister!

705
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,360
If I had had a place to go,

706
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:05,990
I would not have stayed
at the Seoul Railway Station...

707
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,360
Mister... mister...

708
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:31,030
Quick! Quick!

709
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,749
A little more, quick!

710
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,150
You're almost there!

711
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,780
Quick! Quick!

712
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,280
No!

713
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:48,700
Don't look down there!
Over here!

714
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:49,990
You can do it!

715
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,950
No! No!

716
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:59,490
That's it! Try one more!

717
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,780
Faster!

718
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:03,950
Come on!

719
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:05,450
A little faster!

720
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,450
You're almost there!

721
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,320
Be brave! A little more!

722
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,860
Help! Help me!

723
01:16:43,950 --> 01:16:46,289
Hello? Anyone there?

724
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:47,860
Anyone in here?

725
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:49,570
Help! Please!

<i>Hello? Hye-sun?
Are you all right?</i>

Ki-woong.

743
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:59,400
It's over. We can go home now.

744
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:04,650
Ki-woong, Are we saved?

745
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:10,860
Yes, everything's fine,
we can go home.

746
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,650
And daddy? Where is he?

747
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,829
Don't worry, he's fine.

748
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:24,150
We go different ways
to look for you.

749
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:28,199
- He's really OK?
- Yes.

750
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:32,030
- He didn't feel well...
- He's fine now.

751
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:37,280
That's good, really good.

752
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:41,990
Look! There he is.

753
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:44,199
- Sir!
- Dad!

754
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,320
I've found her!

755
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,699
Hye-sun, my dear!

756
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,530
There you are!

757
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:59,699
Hye-sun! At last I found you!

758
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:04,070
I almost die to find you,
little whore!

759
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:08,900
That's not my father!

760
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,400
What?

761
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:13,150
That's my...

762
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:20,150
You must repay
when borrowing money.

763
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:24,150
How could you make me wait like that?

764
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,990
Everything, just because you ran away...

765
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:29,740
Oh my god!

766
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,320
Shit!

767
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:37,650
You're deep in shit to your neck!

768
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,700
No, wait... You said you're her father!

769
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:44,329
That's right, idiot!

770
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:48,070
I'm daddy of all whores
that work for me!

771
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,079
Call me daddy!

772
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,650
Come on, go home, quick

773
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:53,999
Come on!

774
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,159
Let me go!

775
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,329
Don't do that, OK?

776
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:58,949
Son of a bitch!

777
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:00,820
Why dare you?

778
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,070
I'll kill you!

779
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,820
Come here, asshole!

780
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:11,700
Get up, bastard!

781
01:22:19,330 --> 01:22:20,619
Bastard, I'll kill you!

782
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,869
- Boss...
- What?

783
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:24,610
- I beg you...
- Why do you cry?

784
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:29,039
Please let me go back home.

785
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,700
I want to go home!

786
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,200
Go home?

787
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:37,119
Sure, as you wish.

788
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,150
After you've paid me my money, bitch!

789
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:44,400
Until then, you will not
go anywhere, filthy whore!

790
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:46,950
Stupid bitch!

791
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,200
Poor idiot!

792
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:52,700
How pitiful!

793
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,490
- Let me go!
- Shitty whore...

794
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:01,900
Pitiful!

795
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:06,900
You are pathetic!

796
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,610
Motherfucker!

797
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:11,990
Holy shit!

798
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:18,450
No, I beg you!

799
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:20,530
Ki-woong!

800
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:37,110
Go there!

801
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:41,110
Motherfucker...

802
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,150
Fuck, where...?

803
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,700
Where did she go?

804
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,740
Damn!...

805
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:15,450
Eh?

806
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:26,360
Where dis she go, damn it?

807
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,860
This viper...

808
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:46,200
Where is she?

809
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:02,030
Why is this place so big?

810
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:07,150
When can I live in a place like this?

811
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:11,249
Hye-sun! Because of
runaway debtors like you,

812
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:14,070
I'll never could live
in this kind of luxury!

813
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:21,039
Wow!

814
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:25,070
Look at this! What wealth!

815
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:29,860
If only I could fuck here.

816
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,240
Hye-sun!

817
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:38,860
If you haven't taken my money,
I could have paid for this place.

818
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:43,320
My dear, let's go eat.
I'm dyeing of hunger.

819
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,070
Hye-sun.

820
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,490
Hye-sun!

821
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:03,240
Listen. You keep saying
you want to go home,

822
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:06,039
you want me to make
a confession to you?

823
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:10,900
After you left, I came to your home
to request my payment.

824
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:15,079
Your dad was very ill.

825
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,200
You know what I told him?

826
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:21,490
That you've taken my money
and run away,

827
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:26,110
so he has to pay for
the debt of his daughter.

828
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:30,909
He asked me to return next week.

829
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:33,079
He needed one week.

830
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,700
You know what I did?

831
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:39,650
I patiently waited one week.

832
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:43,619
But he never came
to see me after one week.

833
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,780
So I came back to his home.

834
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:49,740
Holy shit!...

835
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:53,400
You always said
you wanted to go back home,

836
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:59,159
but do you know what I saw over there?

837
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,990
Your sick father had fled.

838
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,400
That's what kind your father was!

839
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:10,329
The daughter disappeared
with borrowed money,

840
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:14,700
and the father set sail
to abandon his child.

841
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:16,530
Hye-sun,

842
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:21,360
the home you knew doesn't exist anymore.

843
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,079
Die!

844
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,450
Filthy whore!

845
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,990
Sneaky rat!

846
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,650
Poor connection!

847
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:24,450
What's this, holy shit?

848
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:25,700
Hey!

849
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:29,110
Hey! What's wrong?

850
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:33,950
Wake up. Hey! Hye-sun?

851
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:35,990
My god!

852
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:40,990
Don't die, baby, Hye-sun!

853
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:45,199
Don't do that to me! I'm sorry!

854
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,240
Hye-sun! All is my fault!

855
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,900
Don't die!

856
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:57,360
Pay back my money, whore!

857
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:26,360
Shit!...

858
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:29,150
Hye-sun...
