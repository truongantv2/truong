1
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:47,924
I really don't know what
I'm going to do with you guys.

2
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:52,637
Fine, if you insist, we'll tell you the story.

3
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:56,683
Go on, take a seat and listen up.

4
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,477
A long time ago... Well, not that long ago.

5
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:02,689
This all happened pretty recently.

6
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:07,318
Of all the world's many beast towns,
Jutengai here is the busiest.

7
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:11,698
There are roughly 100,000 beasts
living in our bowl-shaped valley.

8
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:15,201
One day, their lord and leader of many years

9
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,205
declared that he would retire
and be reborn as a god.

10
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,250
Once he'd settled on which god to become,

11
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:26,045
he would have to choose their new lord,

12
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:29,215
so he commanded the others
to ready themselves for this.

13
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:32,385
His successor had to have
first-rate strength and character.

14
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:36,514
That's why the first beast
mentioned was one named Iozen.

15
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:40,560
He was cool and collected,
valiant and courageous--

16
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,021
a mighty figure with many pupils.

17
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,025
He was also the father of two sons,
Ichirohiko and Jiromaru.

18
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,819
All the others were agreed...

19
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:54,032
...that he was sure to be the next lord.

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,703
However, there was another beast nominated.

21
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:01,623
His name was Kumatetsu.

22
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,044
As his name implies,
he had a bearlike appearance,

23
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:08,755
as well as boundless strength
and the agility of a monkey.

24
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,925
He swung his vaunted longsword with ease.

25
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,053
The general consensus was
that he outshined even Iozen...

26
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,848
...at least as far as power went.

27
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:21,726
He wasn't exactly easy to deal with, though.

28
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:27,357
He was boorish, arrogant, and selfish,
so he didn't have a single pupil.

29
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:32,737
Let alone any sons...

30
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,528
--Come here, now.
--Don't touch me.

31
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:14,529
You're underage, aren't you?

32
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:16,030
--No, we're not.
--But you are runaways.

33
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,032
I told you, we aren't.

34
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:07,665
A baby mouse? Or something else?
You're so tiny. Hold on a second.

35
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,504
Here.

36
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:15,214
Eat.

37
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,727
Did you run away from someplace, too?

38
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,191
I'm all alone, too.

39
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:39,739
"Moby-Dick"

40
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:50,208
Dad, where are you now? What are you doing?

41
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,336
Why won't you come for me at a time like this?

42
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,546
Ren, time to get going.

43
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,467
Um, what do we do with this?

44
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:02,053
Oh, we'll move that ourselves.

45
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,763
Okay.

46
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:09,644
Ren, I know you must miss your mom
after losing her so suddenly,

47
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,980
but it was a traffic accident;
there's nothing we can do.

48
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:15,566
The family head will take you in
and look after you. Understand?

49
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:19,612
You're the only boy in the whole
family line--our precious successor.

50
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:22,573
You'll grow up wanting for nothing.

51
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:26,369
Ren! Would you at least answer us?!

52
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,210
Why isn't Dad here?

53
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:35,920
Just forget about him.

54
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:38,297
Why? He's my dad.

55
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:41,050
You know that he and
your mom divorced, right?

56
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:46,764
The courts gave her custody, too.
He's not family anymore.

57
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:49,600
Then I'll live by myself.

58
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:53,730
Hmph, you're just a child.
There's no way you can do that.

59
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:58,067
I'm going to live by myself.
I'll become strong, and get back at you.

60
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:00,820
How dare you speak to us
like that?! Ren, you are--

61
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:05,450
I hate you! You, and my dad--I hate you all!

62
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:07,785
Ren! Wait, Ren!

63
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,589
I hate them.

64
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:26,929
I hate them. I hate them.

65
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:30,516
I hate them! I hate them!

66
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,351
I hate them!!

67
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:52,914
I hate them. I... hate them...

68
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,083
I... hate them...

69
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,393
Chico... I'm okay. Thanks.

70
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,778
What's the big idea, anyway?!

71
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,280
I just have to be stronger than Iozen, right?

72
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,366
"Character"? I don't see the point.

73
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,077
The lord's sure asking for a lot.

74
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,746
How long was that last guy
with you before he ran away?

75
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,123
A month.

76
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,083
A week? A day...?

77
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,876
It was that same morning! The same morning!

78
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:40,837
I can't stand anyone who blubbers!

79
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,089
Is this any time to be choosy?

80
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:47,176
You gotta take a pupil. Even a human
would do--heck, a dishrag would do!

81
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,929
Oh, yeah? Fine, then.

82
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:52,181
Hey, wait, I'm just kidding!

83
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,351
Hey!

84
00:07:57,228 --> 00:07:58,938
I said hey!

85
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,733
Are you alive, or dead?

86
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:03,860
Buzz off.

87
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:07,864
Well, if you're talking, you must
be alive. Where's your mommy?

88
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:08,865
Buzz off.

89
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:10,741
Okay, where's your daddy?

90
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,742
Shut up.

91
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:14,120
Answer me. Where's your daddy?

92
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:18,166
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Say another word to me, and I'll kill you!

93
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:19,625
As if you could, kid!

94
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,627
Let me have a closer look at your face.

95
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,428
B... B...

96
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,182
Beast!

97
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:38,644
Not bad.

98
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,354
Enough, already.

99
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,069
You wanna come with me?

100
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,282
What?! D-Don't be ridiculous, Kumatetsu!

101
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,643
What <i>was</i> that?

102
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,772
A dream?

103
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,401
Hey there, did you run away from home?

104
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,861
L-Let me go!

105
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,280
It's not good for children
to be out at night, is it?

106
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:32,490
Let me go!

107
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,116
Where can we reach your family?

108
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,701
We'll have them come pick you up.

109
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,744
No...

110
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:38,412
Come along, now.

111
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,957
No way! No!

112
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,000
--Hold it right there!
--Hey, hold it!

113
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,087
--Hold it!
--Stop!

114
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:50,174
--Come on!
--Hey!

115
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:56,931
--Where is he?
--Where'd he go?

116
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,149
Huh?

117
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,244
That way?

118
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,996
No, this way!

119
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:07,001
Is this really Shibuya?

120
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:20,222
Huh...?

121
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,932
Huh?

122
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:23,642
<i>Huh?</i>

123
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,035
Ow!

124
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,263
Huh? Huh?

125
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,682
The alley is gone?!

126
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,439
Where's the way out?!

127
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:30,459
"Jutengai"

128
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,821
--L-Let me go!
--Hmm? What have we here?

129
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,406
A human child.

130
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,824
What's he doing here?

131
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,869
Perfect timing. Let's sell his
hide to the shamisen maker.

132
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,746
Or we could slice him up and dry the meat.

133
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,081
Or maybe...

134
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,749
H-Help!

135
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,460
Stop that, you fools!

136
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,879
--Huh?
--Huh?

137
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:17,089
Don't say such ungodly things.

138
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,217
Hmph! Pompous jerk.

139
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:22,219
Hey, don't worry about them.

140
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:25,306
Their bark is worse than their bite.

141
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,391
No need to fear.

142
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,354
I'm Hyakushubo. As you can see,
I am a monk in training.

143
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:36,734
One must take a very specific
route to arrive in Jutengai.

144
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,111
We beasts, who can become gods,

145
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,448
and you humans, who cannot,
live in different worlds, you see.

146
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,075
You must have felt helpless when
you happened to wander in here.

147
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:48,287
Come on, I will deliver you back to your world.

148
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:52,458
Yo! Did you really come here?

149
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:57,755
I expected no less.
I'm liking you more and more!

150
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:58,756
C'mere.

151
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:02,051
What are you doing? This is a lost child.

152
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,761
Can't you cuddle him more gently?!

153
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:07,681
<i>Cuddle</i> him? You monks are always such softies.

154
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,850
I mean don't be so rough with him!

155
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:13,479
What's wrong with being rough?!
And he's no lost child.

156
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,815
As of right now, he's my pupil.

157
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:17,816
Pupil?

158
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,319
I said so, didn't I? Have you forgotten?

159
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,571
You're taking a human child as your pupil?!

160
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,574
Human, dishrag, who cares?

161
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:27,117
He's my pupil and that's that!

162
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,536
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

163
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,871
I told him again and again not to do this.

164
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,957
Tatara, what's going on here?

165
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,668
The lord told him that if
he wanted to be successor,

166
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,795
he had to take on a pupil.

167
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:43,425
But unlike Iozen, <i>nobody</i>
wants to be <i>this</i> guy's pupil.

168
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:48,264
So, while out observing some
poor humans, we found this kid.

169
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:49,890
That's why you kidnapped him?!

170
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,642
He's the one who followed me.

171
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,062
That doesn't mean you can rope in
someone who isn't involved!

172
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:59,733
What, you're saying I can't have
my eye out for someone promising?!

173
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,613
Hey!

174
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:09,702
This is so crazy. Does he want
to be the successor that badly?

175
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:15,165
Nah, he just wants to beat Iozen
in a fight. Nothing more to it.

176
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:19,086
True, he probably has no
interest in becoming the lord

177
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,171
and advancing to godhood.

178
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,926
Even if he managed it, he'd end up
an artifact spirit at best.

179
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:28,971
A toilet god, or a dishrag god, or something.

180
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,849
The human boy is the one to feel sorry for.

181
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,518
Should he really be left with Kumatetsu?

182
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,313
Dunno, but it's not my affair.

183
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,297
What's with this "pupil" thing?

184
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,008
I'm saying I'll feed you from now on.

185
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,094
I never asked you to.

186
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,555
Sleep there.

187
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:15,059
However, I can't stand blubberers.

188
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,769
You start crying, and I'll kick you out.

189
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:17,770
I won't cry.

190
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,313
That's the stuff.

191
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,149
I don't remember agreeing
to be your pupil, though.

192
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,151
Then why did you follow me?

193
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,653
Why did I...?

194
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,989
It's plain as day you've got no place to go.

195
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:30,949
Are you taking pity on me?

196
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,912
Ask me that once you've
grown up a bit, you chump!

197
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,499
You gotta live on your own power,
one way or another.

198
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,837
I never got your name.

199
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,589
--I'm not telling.
--Huh?

200
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,299
That's personal information.

201
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,677
Bah! Then how old are you?

202
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,767
<i>Kyu</i>... ["Nine"]

203
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,647
Then from now on, you'll be "Kyuta."

204
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,774
Why do you get to give me a name?

205
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,984
You're Kyuta now, got it?

206
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,238
Well, I'm hitting the sack now, Kyuta.

207
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,344
Ren...

208
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,390
I made your favorite-an omelet with ham.

209
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,350
Eat it before it gets cold.

210
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,312
Mm-hmm.

211
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,850
Hmph, he ran away.

212
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,394
I figured this would happen.

213
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,118
He's still here!

214
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,169
Breakfast!

215
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,962
Stop that!

216
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,924
Are you still angry?

217
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,844
I was just having a little fun
with you. Cheer up and eat.

218
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:59,973
These are freshly laid eggs. It would
be a waste not to eat them raw.

219
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,767
Unless you're not hungry.

220
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:02,893
Yeah, I'm hungry!

221
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,145
--Then eat!
--I can't eat raw eggs!

222
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:06,522
Huh?

223
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,065
How can I eat something raw?

224
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,817
That's how you're supposed to eat them!

225
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,319
Watch me!

226
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,113
How 'bout that?!

227
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,615
You're crazy.

228
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,200
--What did you say?!
--Wah! Watch it!

229
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,576
Pupils don't get to be picky!

230
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,286
I'm not your pupil!

231
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,412
Shut up and eat!

232
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,539
No way!

233
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,999
You better eat, or else...

234
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,334
Or else what?

235
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,294
I'll cram them into your mouth!

236
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,755
Cut it out, Kumatetsu. Treat him nicely.

237
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:36,510
Don't you get it, Kumatetsu?
Take that little kid back, already.

238
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,136
Huh? Where'd he go?

239
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,180
I hate you, you know that?!

240
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,516
Hey, hold it! Kyuta!

241
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:43,559
Kyuta?

242
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,435
Whoa!

243
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:46,436
Hey!

244
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:49,064
Who'd want to be your pupil?!

245
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,941
Hold it, you little punk!

246
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,116
Whoa! Where'd he go?!

247
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,912
The way out... Where's the way out?

248
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,219
Here you go.

249
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,096
Brother, you want some?

250
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:24,558
No, huh? Okay, I'll eat it by myself.

251
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,394
First, I'll have the tangerine.

252
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,023
On second thought, no.

253
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,942
I'll start with the cherry.

254
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,696
Look, Jiromaru.

255
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,364
It's Father.

256
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:40,449
Daddy!

257
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,492
Ichirohiko, Jiromaru...

258
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,119
Are you training hard?

259
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,370
--Yes!
--Yes!

260
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,123
Father, please train me, too.

261
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,417
Absolutely, right away.

262
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,210
Teacher...

263
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,922
I'll make some more time.
Could you wait a little longer?

264
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,506
Huh? Again?

265
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:57,341
Yes.

266
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,051
Sorry about this.

267
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,222
Kumatetsu!

268
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,643
Hey, Iozen.

269
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,312
I hear you've taken your
first pupil in quite a while.

270
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,358
Yeah, and he took off right away.
Have you seen him?

271
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,193
He's a little kid about this tall.

272
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:19,863
Shouldn't you grow up a little
before taking in kids?

273
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,740
Oh, cram it.

274
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,534
Speaking as the father of two boys,

275
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:28,330
someone like you with no experience
doesn't have what it takes to be a guardian.

276
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:29,873
Oh, yeah?

277
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:33,335
Well, I'm the type who sticks to
his guns once he decides something.

278
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:38,131
But I need to find Kyuta.
Human kids sure are speedy little guys.

279
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,594
Human? Hey, is this pupil
of yours a human child?

280
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:43,595
Teacher!

281
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,514
Ow! Let me go!

282
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:46,682
A human?

283
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,392
What's one doing in our world?

284
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,394
Is that a human?

285
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,562
What's a human doing here?

286
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,189
Ah! Kyuta!

287
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:58,568
Hold on, Kumatetsu. Take my advice and
dump that child back where you found him.

288
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,279
What difference does a human or two make?

289
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,323
You and the others may not know this,

290
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:07,035
but there's a reason why
we live in separate worlds.

291
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:10,706
Humans are frail, which is why
they have darkness in their hearts.

292
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,000
If that darkness takes them over,
and can't be controlled...

293
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:17,629
Darkness? Ha, it didn't look like
he had darkness in him to me.

294
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:20,757
Listen! This is not just your problem!

295
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,301
I'm the one who decides what
I'm gonna do with my pupil!

296
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,347
Look, I'm warning you! For the sake
of everyone in Jutengai, don't do this!

297
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:36,189
For everyone's sake? You think
you're already the new lord, Iozen?

298
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:37,899
What?

299
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,902
Go ahead, try to stop me.

300
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,157
If you want, we can even settle
who the successor will be right now.

301
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:46,908
It's a showdown between Iozen and Kumatetsu!

302
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:47,909
I've been waiting for this!

303
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,077
Give them some room!

304
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:52,497
--Are they deciding who the next lord is?
--Back up some more!

305
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,082
Kumatetsu, take it easy!

306
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,459
Attaway! Get him! Get him!

307
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:56,626
I'm taking Iozen!

308
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,920
--I've got Iozen, too!
--I've got Iozen, too!

309
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,881
Then it's not even a bet, is it?!

310
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,007
Well, well...

311
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,008
Father...

312
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,718
Stand back.

313
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,350
What's with Kumatetsu's attitude?

314
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,602
Doesn't he have any manners?

315
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,895
Are you mocking him?

316
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,730
You could learn something from Iozen!

317
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,193
--Hey!
--Mind your etiquette!

318
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,986
Like he even knows the word "etiquette."

319
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:26,490
That idiot. He's turning
everyone here against him.

320
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,327
Are they going to cut each other up now?

321
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,829
The lord has forbidden
anyone to draw their swords.

322
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,249
We all keep the hilts and sheaths tied together
with cords to keep us from drawing them.

323
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,251
Oh, is that right?!

324
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,464
Oof... H-Hey, hold it! Where did you go?!

325
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,107
Kumatetsu's pretty good!

326
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,823
What are you doing, you fool?

327
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,283
That's just his way of provoking him.

328
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:21,002
That's Iozen for you!

329
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,549
"Now do that to me"?

330
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,482
--Got him!
--Idiot!

331
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,820
Damn it!

332
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:04,212
Whoa-ho-ho...

333
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,715
I'm not done yet!

334
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,475
Father!

335
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,186
Don't worry.

336
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:29,404
There they go!

337
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,436
Watch out!

338
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,188
Iozen is being cornered!

339
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,315
Is this the end of the fight?!

340
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:10,946
Iozen, hang in there!

341
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,155
Iozen!

342
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:18,495
Iozen! Iozen! Iozen! Iozen!...

343
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:23,541
Nobody... Nobody is rooting for him.

344
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:27,796
He's... all alone...

345
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,320
Damn!

346
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:53,989
Do you still want to go at it?

347
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:56,825
I'll keep going until I beat you!

348
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:58,952
Stop it, already.

349
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,079
Like hell.

350
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:02,831
I'm not through yet!

351
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,153
Let him have it, Daddy!

352
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,116
Kumatetsu!

353
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,337
Don't you lose!

354
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,383
--Who was that?
--Someone's rooting for Kumatetsu?

355
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,093
Who? Who?

356
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,513
Don't you lose!

357
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:03,683
Kyu...

358
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,773
--All right!
--That's it!

359
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,236
That's enough.

360
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,114
Lord!

361
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:25,246
What are you doing?
It's too soon for any match.

362
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,541
I haven't yet decided what god I'm going to be.

363
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,213
Lord, please punish Kumatetsu
for taking on a human.

364
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,799
Hmm... You ask me to punish him,

365
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:39,052
but you already laid him out, didn't you?

366
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,265
Whatever... anyone says... Kyuta is my pupil...

367
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:47,143
Ho-ho, you seem determined.

368
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,229
Are you conceding this exception?

369
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:52,023
It pains me to say this, but Kumatetsu
cannot handle the responsibility!

370
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:54,025
Then <i>I</i> will assume responsibility.

371
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:57,695
I am the one who prompted him
to take pupils, after all.

372
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,572
But sir, if he has darkness in his heart...

373
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:03,785
Nothing says that all humans
will be swallowed up by darkness.

374
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:07,997
But... Why are you being
so easy on Kumatetsu?

375
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:11,376
The discussion is over. Disperse!

376
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:18,216
Kumatetsu, be grateful that
the lord has a magnanimous heart.

377
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,195
Damn it!

378
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,079
You are strong, huh?

379
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,707
What fight were you watching?

380
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:54,002
If staying with you really
will make me stronger,

381
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,046
then I'd be willing to become your pupil.

382
00:29:57,255 --> 00:30:00,842
Hmph. I'll bet you just run away again.

383
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,388
These are still within
their freshness date, right?

384
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,196
Y-Yummy...

385
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:32,040
All right, Kyuta, brace yourself,
because I'm gonna train you hard!

386
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:52,393
That looks good on you, Kyuta.

387
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:54,103
Pipe down!

388
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,940
Watch what I'm about to do.

389
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:10,828
Nicely done, nicely done!

390
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:13,539
Got that? Now, you do it.

391
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:14,999
Do what?

392
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,918
Kyuta, good luck.

393
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:38,398
Yow!

394
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,279
Stop. Stop!

395
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,615
W-What should I improve?

396
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:50,618
Heh, "improve," he says. That's a laugh!

397
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:53,705
I-I can't help it! It's my first time!

398
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:57,750
First time! It's my first time!

399
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,210
Hey! Shut up!

400
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,087
How can he do it just by you saying "do it"?

401
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:03,298
You've got to explain
how to do it from step one.

402
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:06,467
--Explain?
--That's a teacher's job, right?

403
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:14,434
What choice do I have?
First, you grasp the sword, "grr," see?

404
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:17,520
Then you go "foosh" and "bang"!

405
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,064
See?

406
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,984
Huh? Th-That's it?

407
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:28,197
No, see, you grasp it like "grr,"
give it a "foosh," and "boom"!

408
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:30,116
Got it?

409
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,368
"G-Grr," you say?

410
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:35,204
No, it's more "<i>grr</i>"!

411
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:37,040
--Grr!
--No, no, no.

412
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:39,083
Like "gwee"!

413
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:41,377
--G-Gwee!
--No, no, no, no!

414
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:43,588
Like "gwaah"!

415
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,257
--G-Gwaah!
--No, no, no, no, no!

416
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,718
--"Gyuwaah"!
--"Gyuwaah"!

417
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,011
"Gyowaah"!

418
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,138
--"G-Gyowaah"!
--No! No, no, no!

419
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:56,309
Completely wrong!
You're so slow on the uptake!

420
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,272
--This is stupid! I quit!
--What?!

421
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,566
There's no way I can do it
if you teach me like this!

422
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,318
Stop whining and just do it!

423
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:06,861
--No!
--Do it!

424
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,696
--No!
--Ah, dang it!

425
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:11,616
Kyuta is a beginner.
You have to teach more simply.

426
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:16,079
Yeah, I get it! Okay, I'll
explain it more thoroughly!

427
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:20,625
Grip the sword inside your heart!
You've got a sword in your heart, don't you?!

428
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,543
Yeah, right! Are you kidding?

429
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:25,463
The sword in your heart is important!

430
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:30,343
Right in here! Get it? Now do it!

431
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,346
Do it!

432
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,397
Where are you going?

433
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:47,527
What's wrong with him?
All he ever does is rant and rave.

434
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:50,196
Kumatetsu! Wait up, Kumatetsu!

435
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:54,367
Hmph, "sword in my heart"
my eye, you dummy.

436
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:57,036
Look, go back where you came from, already.

437
00:33:57,245 --> 00:34:00,498
--Huh?
--For a pupil, training for
five or ten years is common.

438
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:04,001
You think you can handle that
with your flimsy resolve?

439
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,670
If you just want food in your belly,

440
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:08,172
have someone look after you
in the human world.

441
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:12,593
There's no place for you here. Now scram.

442
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:18,266
Where is he?

443
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:22,603
I'm not sure. He said something
about being gone two or three days.

444
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:25,398
Tell me, what is it that a pupil does?

445
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:30,611
First you do the cleaning,
the laundry, the cooking...

446
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,364
What's come over you? Is this about yesterday?

447
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,074
Not really.

448
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:40,955
Leave him be. He blows his stack in a hurry,

449
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:44,083
but the next day, he's forgotten all about it.

450
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:46,627
It's a waste of energy to worry about it.

451
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:48,754
I told you, it's not that.

452
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:52,341
They're going to wrinkle like that.
Shake them out more.

453
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,051
Okay.

454
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:56,804
Mm-hmm.

455
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:07,940
I've never sold anything to a human before.

456
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:09,108
Is that right?

457
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:10,860
How long are you going to be here?

458
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,069
I don't know.

459
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:14,113
Well, that was rather curt.

460
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:18,117
Sheesh, there's just no helping those humans.

461
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,548
You human jerk! You monster!

462
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:34,884
I heard what my Daddy was saying about you!

463
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:38,304
Before long, humans go out of control!

464
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:41,307
I'm gonna bring you down now,
while there's still time!

465
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:43,684
Stop, Jiromaru!

466
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:44,977
Brother...

467
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:48,481
How is a weakling like him
supposed to become a monster?

468
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:51,025
The next time my brother does
anything mean, just let me know.

469
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:52,109
I'll set him straight.

470
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:54,403
You'll be sorry if you tattle on me!

471
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:55,863
That's enough, Jiromaru.

472
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:59,492
I just lose my temper whenever
I see someone who's weak.

473
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,661
Hey, my brother is strong!

474
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,914
He can make things float without
touching them, just like the sages!

475
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,999
Hey, show him, will you?

476
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,086
No. Powers aren't for showing off.

477
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:13,631
Father always says they're
for kindness' sake, doesn't he?

478
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,551
I'm still just a child,
but I'm going to train hard,

479
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:21,430
and someday I'll be a great swordsman
with big tusks, just like Father!

480
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:25,309
I will, too! I'm gonna be a
cool swordsman, just like Daddy!

481
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,436
--Let's go.
--Mm-hmm!

482
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,569
"A weakling like him," huh?

483
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:36,279
Damn!

484
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:43,244
What is this?! Who cleaned up
in here without asking first?!

485
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:44,912
It was your pupil.

486
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:47,081
Who asked you to do this?!

487
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,874
Huh?

488
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,419
How did you get those bruises?

489
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,796
Hmph, pathetic.

490
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:57,758
Aren't you embarrassed that
he kicked your butt? Ah, geez...

491
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:01,637
I know, I'm weak, and I'm pathetic.
You're absolutely right.

492
00:37:01,846 --> 00:37:03,222
Just as long as you know.

493
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:06,350
Well, if I may, what about you?

494
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,229
--Huh?
--He gets up early, while you sleep until noon.

495
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:12,648
He's always busy, while you're always free.

496
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:14,942
And even though you're free,
you never do anything.

497
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,902
By "he," do you mean Iozen?

498
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:19,614
He may be busy, but he's still polite.

499
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:22,116
You're always free, but you're rude and sloppy.

500
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:24,118
What are you getting at?

501
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:27,496
I've got a pretty good idea
why you can't beat him.

502
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,833
What did you say, you little bastard?!

503
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:33,044
Hey! I dare you to say it again!

504
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:34,754
I'll say it as much as I like!

505
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:36,130
You're the absolute worst!

506
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:37,632
Calm down, both of you!

507
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,759
Who do you think you are,
talking to your teacher like that?!

508
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,844
If you're a teacher, then act like one!

509
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:43,471
What?!

510
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,222
You lose your temper over the smallest things!

511
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:47,892
--Hey!
--You give up too easily, saying it's too hard!

512
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,436
You've got some nerve, giving me advice!

513
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:52,438
A pupil keeps quiet and does what he's told!

514
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:55,775
No way! If I do what you tell me,
I'll catch your stupidity!

515
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,193
Shut up, you bastard!

516
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:58,235
You shut up, you idiot!

517
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:01,489
Forgive him, Kyuta!
Kumatetsu is just a big oaf!

518
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,532
--Ah, Kumatetsu, let's step outside, okay?
--Be lenient!

519
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,910
--Outside! Outside!
--Let me go! Let me go!

520
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,913
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

521
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,916
I'm doing the best I can for him, if you ask me!

522
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,918
So where does that jerk get off?!

523
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,962
You've learned your lesson, right?
Toss him out, already.

524
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:18,673
And I am not always free!

525
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:22,009
I make money splitting firewood,
plastering, and picking tea leaves!

526
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:23,803
I even work extra, to cover him!

527
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:26,138
So turn him loose, I say.

528
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:29,558
So he's got no business
saying those things about me!

529
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:30,518
Am I right?!

530
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:35,481
Absolutely. You see how living by
yourself was so much easier, right?

531
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:40,319
Living alone is so nice.
No responsibilities, and no bother.

532
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:43,781
And nobody telling you
the truth and setting you off.

533
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,033
Oh, that just slipped out.

534
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:51,956
Training this late into the night, are we?
I'm impressed, Kumatetsu.

535
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,332
Lord!

536
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:58,212
It can be beneficial to educate your pupil
by letting him see your own efforts.

537
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,881
Uh, r-right. That's what I thought.

538
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,843
Very good. Let me offer you these as a reward.

539
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,010
What are those?

540
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:06,387
Referral letters.

541
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:07,388
Referral letters?

542
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:10,433
Take your pupil and go on a
pilgrimage to some other lands.

543
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:14,395
These will let you meet the
other lords with no trouble.

544
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:15,438
Y-Yes, but...

545
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:17,481
These are some noteworthy sages.

546
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,901
You should be able to discover
some clues as to what true strength is.

547
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,611
Still...

548
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:27,074
Well, have a good journey.

549
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:30,911
Aww, just when you had a chance
to rid yourself of that kid!

550
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,790
But you can't refuse the lord's instructions.

551
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,801
Too slow!

552
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,600
Too slow!

553
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:07,948
Too slow! Too slow, too slow, too slow!

554
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:09,366
Jerk!

555
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:12,203
At least slow down when you're eating, guys.

556
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:15,456
We would humbly ask you
the following question:

557
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,291
What is strength?

558
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,461
I am not strong in the muscular sense,

559
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:24,799
but look, I am able to create illusions.

560
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:29,512
Don't take them lightly. At times,
illusions can be more genuine than truth.

561
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,805
Which is to say...

562
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:32,598
Which is to say...?

563
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,768
They are strength.

564
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,854
What is strength?

565
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:41,398
What can come of seeking that?

566
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:45,194
--Huh?
--I have a fair amount of telekinetic power,

567
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:48,697
but no matter how great my strength,
there are some battles I cannot win.

568
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:50,449
Which is to say...

569
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:52,159
Which is to say...?

570
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:54,328
--I hate to trouble you...
--Huh?

571
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:57,039
...but could you give me a backrub?

572
00:40:57,248 --> 00:41:02,253
My telekinesis has no effect
on my lumbago. Ooh...

573
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,254
Strength?

574
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:06,131
I'm afraid your question
is misplaced in my case.

575
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:12,137
All I do, rain or shine, is sit here like a stone.

576
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:13,389
Why is that?

577
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:17,309
To forget time, forget the world,
and forget even myself,

578
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:20,646
and thus transcend all reality. Which is to say...

579
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:22,439
Which is to say...?

580
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,278
She turned to stone.

581
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:29,405
Strength?

582
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,032
I don't engage in philosophy.

583
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:35,244
Whoever reels in the catch first...

584
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:41,000
...and savors all the world
has to offer comes out on top.

585
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:44,336
If you see an opening, seize it.

586
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:45,754
Which is to say...

587
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:46,881
Which is to say...?

588
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:48,841
You're wide open!

589
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,559
Relax, I don't eat my guests.

590
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:04,398
See? You listen to their nonsense,
and you only lose sight of yourself.

591
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:07,276
I almost got eaten, and lost all of myself.

592
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:09,570
The word "strong" has lots of meanings, huh?

593
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,739
Each of those sages had
something interesting to say.

594
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:15,034
Oh? Then plop down at
a desk and get to studying!

595
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:17,494
Yeah, doing that would
be much more meaningful.

596
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:21,707
At least I wouldn't be saying "foosh"
or "gyowaah" like a certain somebody.

597
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:23,667
You have to find the meaning for yourself!

598
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:25,169
Says the guy who can't explain anything.

599
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,587
You're just slow on the uptake!

600
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,547
The problem is the way you teach!

601
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:30,799
--Don't give me that, you problem pupil!
--You guys never run out

602
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:33,344
--What did you call me?!
--of strength to argue, at least.

603
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:36,347
Give us a break, already. We're exhausted.

604
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:51,320
Can't sleep?

605
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,989
Do I not have any talent?

606
00:42:54,198 --> 00:42:55,282
Does that worry you?

607
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:56,909
He says I'm slow.

608
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:59,078
I don't think that's true.

609
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:02,331
At first, you didn't know anything
about laundry or cleaning,

610
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:04,959
but after a little training,
you soon got the hang of it.

611
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:08,003
You're a hard worker,
and you pick things up quickly.

612
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:10,547
Still...

613
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:13,175
Kumatetsu is the one who has a problem.

614
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:15,844
Just look at his moves. They're a mess.

615
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:19,348
By which I mean they're
outside-the-box. Why is that?

616
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:22,726
He didn't have any parents or a teacher.

617
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:23,811
Huh?

618
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:28,482
He got as strong as he is all on his own.
And now he is strong.

619
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:31,402
This is both his talent and his misfortune.

620
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,696
He never listens to anything
others say, and likewise,

621
00:43:33,904 --> 00:43:35,948
he's never able to offer
others any decent advice.

622
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:37,866
Is that right?

623
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:41,954
Still, once in a while,
I do learn something from him.

624
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:44,498
Do you know what I mean?

625
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:47,334
Like when he says to find the meaning yourself?

626
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:51,213
Yes. I thought he made a valid point.

627
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:57,386
I don't know how I'm supposed to teach him.

628
00:43:57,594 --> 00:44:01,849
Imagine, the great Kumatetsu,
so hung up on an obnoxious brat.

629
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,767
Th-That's not it!

630
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:07,604
Well, you were plenty
obnoxious yourself at his age.

631
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:10,190
As weak as you were,
you were an expert smart-mouth.

632
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,568
I just didn't have a decent teacher back then.

633
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:16,113
Other than the lord, no one would
have anything to do with you.

634
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:20,451
They gave you up for a
disobedient pain in the neck.

635
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:23,829
Crap, just remembering
those jerks pisses me off!

636
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:27,833
Yep, they were just like you are now.

637
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:31,920
I want that kid gone, personally,

638
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:34,923
but if you want to keep being his teacher,

639
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:41,221
you'd better start remembering everything
you really wanted when you were a kid.

640
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,974
Well, good night.

641
00:44:54,902 --> 00:44:57,988
"Find the meaning yourself," huh?

642
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:02,743
I don't get it.

643
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:13,504
That's me doing you, Chico.

644
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,215
Huh? No good?

645
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:23,555
You'll make it. Pretend you already have.

646
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,396
Was that you?

647
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:37,402
I'll make it... I'll make it...

648
00:46:02,386 --> 00:46:04,304
What am I doing?

649
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:14,189
I can at least learn his footwork.

650
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:37,880
Ow! Ow! Ow!

651
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:41,466
What's this? What are you up to?

652
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:45,429
You'll make it. Pretend you already have.

653
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,751
What are you guys doing?

654
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:16,919
Are you mocking me?!

655
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:18,086
No, I'm not!

656
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:20,672
--Then what is that?!
--Doesn't matter, does it?!

657
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:32,309
You're bugging me!

658
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,231
Huh?

659
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,902
Geez, what does he think he's doing?

660
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,112
You're like a father duck and a duckling.

661
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:45,530
I'm no duck.

662
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:48,367
It's natural for children to
grow up imitating their parents.

663
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:50,202
I'm no parent.

664
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,121
Kyuta means to learn everything from you.

665
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,582
Just like a baby following his father around.

666
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,376
Baby?

667
00:48:12,808 --> 00:48:16,520
Oh, Kumatetsu, you're not as
annoyed as you'd have us believe.

668
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:21,066
They say that no parent is unhappy when
their child takes after them, but I wonder...

669
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:24,403
Hey, kid, how long are you
going to keep this farce up?

670
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:27,030
If you could get stronger by being
a copycat, everyone would do it.

671
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,740
Hey, stay out of this.

672
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:32,119
Huh? After all your griping
about it bugging you?

673
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:34,288
Never mind, just go away.

674
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:37,749
Hey, when did he become a different person?

675
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:41,253
Good question. He's taken
a shine to his obedient pupil.

676
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:44,298
Ha! That jerk doesn't have it in him--

677
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:47,676
You mean it?!

678
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:09,740
Oh, I've got you now.

679
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:10,991
Here, how do you like this?!

680
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,242
There it is!

681
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:13,785
Huh? Whoa, hold on, hold on!

682
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:15,537
Hold nothing.

683
00:49:15,746 --> 00:49:17,039
Wait, wait, just a second, here!

684
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:18,248
I'm not waiting!

685
00:49:18,457 --> 00:49:20,167
What, seriously?

686
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,221
Huh?

687
00:49:39,728 --> 00:49:41,396
I'm not even watching...

688
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:46,193
...and I can tell...

689
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,905
I can tell...!

690
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,115
Dang it!

691
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:57,079
Let's test it.

692
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:07,339
Ow!

693
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:08,924
--Ow! Ow!
--What's up, Kyuta?

694
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:12,260
What the hell are you doing? Stop it!

695
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:18,600
What's going on?

696
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:20,685
Kyuta, you're...

697
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:22,854
After watching your feet
and copying you for so long,

698
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:25,065
I've gotten so I can tell
what your next step will be.

699
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:28,693
What?! Stop messing around!

700
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:32,030
This is a huge deal, Kyuta!

701
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,075
For the first time, you've impressed me!

702
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:38,161
Kumatetsu, you could
learn something from Kyuta.

703
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,747
<i>I</i> could learn something?!

704
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:41,873
Why should I?!

705
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:43,166
I'd be willing to teach you.

706
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,210
--Huh?!
--In return...

707
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:46,837
Huh?!

708
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:51,466
I don't know how to hold a sword,
or throw a punch, or anything...

709
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:53,969
...so teach me that!

710
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,228
Ow!

711
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:07,899
Damn! Teach me better than this!

712
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:08,900
Ow!

713
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,111
Watch your opponent closely and match them.

714
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:12,821
--Ow! Ow!
--Match them!

715
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:17,617
Kumatetsu has no regard
for anyone but himself,

716
00:51:17,826 --> 00:51:20,662
so matching others gives him
more trouble than anything.

717
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:23,874
That's what he gets for
growing strong on his own.

718
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:24,875
Ow!

719
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,418
You have to match your opponent!

720
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:27,586
I am! Ow!

721
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:28,795
No, you're not.

722
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:31,381
You sure talk big, you...

723
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,511
Teach me better than this.

724
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:46,563
Darn it!

725
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:54,988
Don't get too full of yourself.

726
00:51:55,197 --> 00:51:56,656
--I'll take Jiromaru.
--I've got Jiromaru, too.

727
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:58,408
I've got Jiromaru, too.

728
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:18,595
You're awesome!

729
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:21,431
--Huh?
--I like guys who are strong!

730
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,433
Come over to my house to visit some time!

731
00:52:23,642 --> 00:52:25,435
We've got lots of yummy candy!

732
00:52:25,644 --> 00:52:27,604
So come by and visit!

733
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:30,982
I did it!

734
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:35,403
Damn!

735
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:38,323
I asked you guys to eat slowly.

736
00:52:38,532 --> 00:52:40,742
I win! You do the dishes!

737
00:52:40,951 --> 00:52:42,452
Damn!

738
00:52:49,084 --> 00:52:50,877
You've gotten a lot taller, huh?

739
00:52:51,086 --> 00:52:52,462
You think so, Mr. Hyaku?

740
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:54,297
--Eh?!
--Mr. Tata...

741
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:57,050
When did that happen? For real?!

742
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,646
Ho... The kid's developing a decent form.

743
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,231
So it seems.

744
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:13,692
I'm impressed that he's
brought a human child this far.

745
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,403
Oh, even you haven't noticed?

746
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:20,282
--Huh?
--The one who has grown
the most is Kumatetsu.

747
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:23,326
He's becoming polished and sharper.

748
00:53:23,535 --> 00:53:24,327
You're right.

749
00:53:24,536 --> 00:53:27,080
There's no telling who will become lord now.

750
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:33,712
Kyuta, how old have you gotten?

751
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:38,091
You have? Then from now on,
you'll be "Junana-ta."

752
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,968
I'll stick with "Kyuta."

753
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:49,227
Master Kumatetsu,
please take me as your pupil!

754
00:53:49,436 --> 00:53:51,688
I want to become strong, too, like Kyuta!

755
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:54,190
All right, you're just about ready.

756
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:57,235
--Thank you very much!
--Okay, the line's over there.

757
00:53:57,444 --> 00:54:01,323
Go to the end and wait with
your mediator's fee ready.

758
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:08,079
Bunch of snot-nosed brats
with no promise, I say. Hmm?

759
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:09,873
I'll decide what my own
training schedule will be!

760
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,333
No, <i>I'll</i> decide!

761
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:14,252
Kyuta is an adult now.
Start treating him like one.

762
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:17,922
This guy? He's all smooth,
with no hair sprouting anywhere!

763
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:19,257
I have sprouted hair!

764
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:22,052
--Where have you sprouted any?!
--Hey, now...

765
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,803
I win! See you!

766
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:25,096
Hold it!

767
00:54:25,305 --> 00:54:26,681
I'm not done talking!

768
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,099
You do the dishes!

769
00:54:28,308 --> 00:54:30,018
Hold up, you little bastard!

770
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:33,938
Hmm? Hey, Kyuta! Come by and visit!

771
00:54:34,147 --> 00:54:35,482
Later!

772
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,150
Hey, hold it!

773
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,821
Kyuta is something else. Thanks to him,
Kumatetsu is big business.

774
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,617
Daddy says that even our squads
have to start watching themselves.

775
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:51,206
Kumatetsu? Hmph. Don't compare
that small-timer to Father.

776
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:57,295
Huh? What's the matter, Brother?

777
00:54:57,504 --> 00:54:59,047
It's nothing.

778
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:01,675
Whoa...! Where'd you go?!

779
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:10,558
Man, that guy is tenacious.

780
00:55:15,939 --> 00:55:18,233
Huh? ls this...?

781
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:59,441
...a... at her... helm...

782
00:55:59,649 --> 00:56:05,363
...she sported there... A... of a... in the...

783
00:56:05,572 --> 00:56:09,826
...from the long... narrow...

784
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:21,463
Say...

785
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:23,339
How do you read this word?

786
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:27,385
"Whale."

787
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:30,138
Oh, whale, huh?

788
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:38,229
--I told you so!
--Oh, did he?

789
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:42,650
--I don't know.
--Cram it, would you? Hello? They hung up!

790
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:53,536
--What?
--lf you're going to make noise, go outside.

791
00:56:53,745 --> 00:56:55,580
And what can we do outside?

792
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:58,124
That's entirely up to you, isn't it?

793
00:56:59,793 --> 00:57:01,336
Let's go.

794
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:17,894
"15
Melville
Moby-Dick"

795
00:57:25,819 --> 00:57:29,906
She's been a pest that
everyone's ignored since first year.

796
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:33,117
So, we can do anything we want, right?

797
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:35,328
Hey, don't you walk away!

798
00:57:35,537 --> 00:57:37,997
--Stop!
--We can do whatever we like outside, right?

799
00:57:38,206 --> 00:57:41,042
We're not bothering anyone, after all.

800
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,839
Don't move.

801
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:52,595
Ah, were you watching?
Just a spot of trouble, you see.

802
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:57,183
You didn't see anything, did you, loser?!

803
00:57:57,392 --> 00:57:59,352
Don't make that face at me!

804
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:01,354
What is that guy wearing? How lame!

805
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:03,147
Super lame!

806
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:09,195
--Let's go.
--Mm-hmm.

807
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:24,878
It's not true that everyone
in prep school gets along.

808
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,677
Violence isn't right.
Still, thanks for helping me.

809
00:58:32,886 --> 00:58:34,470
I wasn't actually helping you.

810
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:36,556
But you did help me.

811
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:39,058
Say, how do you read this?

812
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:46,190
I don't know anything. I haven't
gone to school since grade school.

813
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,984
Really?

814
00:58:50,987 --> 00:58:55,199
Okay, I'll teach you all
of the words in that book.

815
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:58,161
Really?

816
00:58:58,369 --> 00:58:59,287
Mm-hmm.

817
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:04,918
I'm Kaede. It's written like "tree"
next to "wind," and read "Kaede."

818
00:59:05,126 --> 00:59:09,547
I'm... Ren. The character for "Ren" is...

819
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:14,302
The "grass" radical over "to extend."

820
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,137
Yeah.

821
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:19,599
"Ren."

822
00:59:21,976 --> 00:59:24,437
"Chapter 1: Loomings"

823
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:30,151
"Children's Encyclopedia"

824
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:42,997
"Chapter 10: A Bosom Friend"

825
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:47,961
"Break on through to the..."

826
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:50,713
Kyuta! Kyuta!

827
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:52,382
--Pipe down!
--You're late!

828
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,092
Don't yell!

829
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:55,510
"Chapter 21: Going Aboard"

830
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:07,814
"Spyhop"

831
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:18,241
Kyuta!

832
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:19,659
He went out a while ago.

833
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:22,495
He seems to be keeping busy lately.

834
01:00:22,704 --> 01:00:23,871
Doing what?!

835
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,542
The main character is trying
to get revenge on the whale

836
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:29,627
for taking one of his legs.

837
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:34,757
But... maybe it's himself
that he's really fighting.

838
01:00:34,966 --> 01:00:36,759
Himself?

839
01:00:36,968 --> 01:00:40,596
In other words, the whale
is a mirror reflecting him.

840
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:42,432
A mirror?

841
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,350
You have incredible concentration!

842
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,895
At this rate, you might be able to solve
the problems in my study book soon.

843
01:00:48,104 --> 01:00:50,023
Kaede, you're a good teacher.

844
01:00:50,231 --> 01:00:51,274
Really?

845
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:54,902
Take it from someone who is pretty fussy
about his teachers. There's no question.

846
01:00:55,111 --> 01:00:58,531
This teacher is the one who
raised you and taught you kendo?

847
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,700
My dud of a teacher.

848
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:01,951
You must get along well.

849
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,704
Heck, no! All we do is yell at each other.

850
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:06,664
Must be nice. I envy you.

851
01:01:06,873 --> 01:01:07,874
Why?

852
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:11,419
I've never had a fight with my parents.

853
01:01:12,587 --> 01:01:14,297
Huh?

854
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:17,216
I'm here to make my parents happy.

855
01:01:17,425 --> 01:01:18,968
I've been taking exams since kindergarten,

856
01:01:19,177 --> 01:01:23,139
working like crazy to get the grades
that my mom and dad want.

857
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:28,978
And yet neither of them cares how I feel.
They don't even realize.

858
01:01:29,187 --> 01:01:33,191
But I know that I am the one
who has to find who I am,

859
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:35,234
or I'll never be my real self.

860
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:37,862
That's why now, even when
it's hard, I study for dear life,

861
01:01:38,071 --> 01:01:42,909
so I can earn the grades I need to get
a free ride to college and leave home.

862
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:45,620
After that, I'll study just for myself,

863
01:01:45,828 --> 01:01:51,709
graduate on my own,
and then start living my own life.

864
01:01:57,799 --> 01:02:01,928
Ah! That's the first time I've ever
told anyone what I really want!

865
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:05,765
I feel so invigorated!

866
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:07,266
Kaede...

867
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:09,811
Listen, about that book...

868
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:13,147
--Huh?
--There's a limit to how well I can teach you.

869
01:02:13,356 --> 01:02:18,111
I'm sure there are teachers who can
teach you how to read it even better.

870
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:19,403
Where?

871
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:22,156
Ren, how do you feel about going to college?

872
01:02:22,365 --> 01:02:24,992
--No way.
--I'll back you up if you want to take the exams.

873
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:27,036
But I could never get into college.

874
01:02:27,245 --> 01:02:30,873
Don't you want to learn a lot
more things that you don't know?

875
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:34,794
Yeah, I do.

876
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:37,713
There's something called the
"Certificate for Students Achieving

877
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:40,091
the Proficiency Level of Upper
Secondary School Graduates."

878
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:43,010
They used to call it the "Dai-ten,"
and it's a test that allows

879
01:02:43,219 --> 01:02:45,513
those who haven't gone to high school
to take college entrance exams.

880
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:46,806
No way.

881
01:02:47,014 --> 01:02:47,807
Huh?

882
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:51,936
I don't care how smart you are--
if you've been a shut-in this long,

883
01:02:52,145 --> 01:02:54,605
how about you start with some
middle school night classes instead?

884
01:02:54,814 --> 01:02:55,731
Ah, but...

885
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,067
The world is not so forgiving a place.

886
01:02:58,276 --> 01:03:01,696
Even on the off chance
you pass, how will you pay?

887
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:03,364
You can't even find financial aid anymore

888
01:03:03,573 --> 01:03:05,825
unless there are major
extenuating circumstances.

889
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:08,035
Yes, but...

890
01:03:08,244 --> 01:03:09,662
Fine, we get it!

891
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:12,957
There really is no way I can go to college.

892
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,709
I'm sorry!

893
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:19,005
Ask me anything. There are more than
a few colleges offering scholarships,

894
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:21,716
and I can recommend some
private grants-mot loans.

895
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:24,010
It depends on your grades, of course.

896
01:03:24,218 --> 01:03:26,470
Th-Thank you very much!

897
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:28,723
Thank you very much.

898
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:33,227
I'll have to cram math and science.
I haven't studied those at all.

899
01:03:33,436 --> 01:03:36,355
Leave it to me! I'll teach
you whatever you need!

900
01:03:37,732 --> 01:03:40,943
You'll need a resident card to take the test,

901
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:50,995
"Identification Forms Reception"

902
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:51,871
so you can apply for a new resident card.

903
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,250
Would you please double-check that
your father's current address is correct?

904
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:02,715
Your father who lived separately from you?

905
01:04:02,924 --> 01:04:06,302
I had no idea where he was.

906
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:09,305
I can't believe it was this easy to find him.

907
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:10,806
Will you go see him?

908
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:13,643
It may inconvenience him,
dropping in out of the blue.

909
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:16,771
He may have completely forgotten about me.

910
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:19,774
Even so... Even so...

911
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:31,702
What am I supposed to write?

912
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,334
Dad, give me the ball!

913
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,044
Here!

914
01:04:59,397 --> 01:05:05,069
"Akasaka Shoes"

915
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:08,239
Oh, you're right. How careless of me.

916
01:05:08,447 --> 01:05:09,865
Thank you very much.

917
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:11,575
You're welcome.

918
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:15,830
Excuse me...

919
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:19,250
Yes?

920
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:23,296
Do you... remember... me?

921
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:37,393
Didn't think so.

922
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,228
I beg your pardon.

923
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:48,279
Ren?

924
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:54,744
Is that you, Ren?

925
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:06,005
Look how big you've gotten!
I didn't recognize you!

926
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:07,798
How have you been all this time?!

927
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:13,179
Oh, well... There's someone
who's looked after me, and...

928
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:16,140
Thank goodness... you're all right...

929
01:06:19,477 --> 01:06:23,314
I'm so sorry... that I couldn't do
anything for you before now...

930
01:06:23,522 --> 01:06:25,024
Dad...

931
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:33,199
You did? Good for you.

932
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:37,161
My dad said he didn't find out
about my mom until long afterward.

933
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:39,288
He looked for me for a long
time after I went missing,

934
01:06:39,497 --> 01:06:43,292
and even after the police gave up,
he searched for me.

935
01:06:43,501 --> 01:06:45,169
Oh, yeah?

936
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:46,796
Kaede!

937
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:48,589
Hey, Kaede, is that your boyfriend?

938
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:49,757
No, he's not!

939
01:06:49,965 --> 01:06:50,800
Then who is he?

940
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:51,801
What school does he go to?

941
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:53,677
Go away!

942
01:06:55,554 --> 01:06:56,347
Sorry.

943
01:06:56,555 --> 01:07:00,142
Mm-mm. You think I can be normal now?

944
01:07:00,351 --> 01:07:01,894
Normal?

945
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:05,356
Stay with my dad, like normal folks do,

946
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:07,858
and study and work, like normal,

947
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:10,319
go home, like normal,
and go to bed, like normal.

948
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:14,448
Do you think a life like that
is in the cards for me?

949
01:07:14,657 --> 01:07:16,700
You're not sure?

950
01:07:18,494 --> 01:07:20,162
About your teacher?

951
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:30,464
Where did you go?

952
01:07:30,673 --> 01:07:33,134
I need advice. I want you
to listen seriously to me.

953
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:34,927
What about your training?

954
01:07:35,136 --> 01:07:36,303
Listen. The truth is--

955
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:37,721
You think you can just blow it off?

956
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,182
Listen to him, Kumatetsu.

957
01:07:40,391 --> 01:07:42,309
First, tell me what this is.

958
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:45,604
It was under your bed. Explain yourself.

959
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:48,816
I want to go to a human school.

960
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:51,402
--Huh?
--I want to learn about the other world, so...

961
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:54,780
Don't you have more important
things to do than that?

962
01:07:54,989 --> 01:07:57,158
I thought becoming strong
was your goal, wasn't it?

963
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:59,410
--I have gotten strong.
--Huh?! Don't make me laugh!

964
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:00,578
Kumatetsu...

965
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:02,496
I've gotten strong enough.

966
01:08:02,705 --> 01:08:05,249
How do you figure you've
gotten strong?! Huh?!

967
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:08,335
Ugh, this always happens
whenever I talk to you, doesn't it?

968
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:11,338
You don't listen to me; you just
shout whatever you feel like saying.

969
01:08:11,547 --> 01:08:13,674
Tell me! When did you become strong?!

970
01:08:13,883 --> 01:08:14,675
Forget it.

971
01:08:14,884 --> 01:08:17,261
Hold it! Where are you going?

972
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:20,306
I have something else to tell you.
I found my father.

973
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:22,975
That's where I'm going. I just decided.

974
01:08:25,186 --> 01:08:27,688
Wait! Wait!

975
01:08:27,897 --> 01:08:29,064
--Don't go!
--Move.

976
01:08:29,273 --> 01:08:30,816
I won't let you go!

977
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:38,407
Don't go!

978
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:43,162
Kyuta! Kyuta!

979
01:08:45,331 --> 01:08:48,167
Did you solve whatever you were unsure about?

980
01:08:49,585 --> 01:08:51,128
I guess not.

981
01:08:51,337 --> 01:08:55,049
It doesn't matter anymore.
I'm going to go see my dad now.

982
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:57,051
Once I see him, I'll figure it out.

983
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:58,302
Aren't you forcing things?

984
01:08:58,511 --> 01:09:00,554
Why would I be?

985
01:09:00,763 --> 01:09:04,600
I'll be in the library all day today.
If anything happens, come by!

986
01:09:07,019 --> 01:09:09,104
No! No, no, no, no!

987
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:12,483
--I'm sorry.
--Anyone who isn't slow should understand this!

988
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:15,236
--I'm sorry.
--Stop apologizing for everything!

989
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:16,403
We' re sorry!

990
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:18,113
Enough!

991
01:09:18,322 --> 01:09:20,157
Geez, what's wrong with everybody?!

992
01:09:20,366 --> 01:09:23,202
Imagine, the father finally appearing now.

993
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,412
Do you think he really means to not come back?

994
01:09:25,621 --> 01:09:27,456
There's no reason why he
<i>would</i> come back, right?

995
01:09:27,665 --> 01:09:28,707
Hmm...

996
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:32,711
Without Kyuta, Kumatetsu will go back
to the hopeless mess he was before.

997
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,004
Nah, he already has--

998
01:09:34,213 --> 01:09:35,172
--Shut up!
--Whoa!

999
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:38,050
What the hell are you doing?! Watch it!

1000
01:09:38,259 --> 01:09:42,555
Despite what he's like, he's considered himself
Kyuta's substitute father all this time.

1001
01:09:42,763 --> 01:09:44,473
Who, him?

1002
01:09:44,682 --> 01:09:46,225
Crap.

1003
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:55,943
Ren!

1004
01:09:56,944 --> 01:09:59,488
Tonight's supper. Omelets with ham.

1005
01:09:59,697 --> 01:10:01,699
I'll cook, and we can eat together.

1006
01:10:06,704 --> 01:10:12,459
So, would you tell me more about this
person who has been looking after you?

1007
01:10:12,668 --> 01:10:13,919
Huh?

1008
01:10:14,128 --> 01:10:17,590
I have to pay my respects.
After that, I'll thank him properly,

1009
01:10:17,798 --> 01:10:20,050
and then the two of us can live together.

1010
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:21,302
Just a minute...

1011
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:24,346
Hm? Of course we will.

1012
01:10:24,555 --> 01:10:29,351
It's just... I can't suddenly
make up for lost time.

1013
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,146
Oh. I just thought...

1014
01:10:32,354 --> 01:10:34,898
Yeah, you're right. The passage
of time for an adult is different

1015
01:10:35,107 --> 01:10:39,111
than the passage of time for a child.

1016
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:44,366
To me, it seems like just yesterday
that I lived with you and your mom.

1017
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:45,659
Yesterday...

1018
01:10:45,868 --> 01:10:47,411
Sorry if I pressured you.

1019
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:49,913
Let's start over, little by little.

1020
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:52,458
We'll forget about all the
difficulties you've had up to now,

1021
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:55,169
and from here on, we'll start moving forward.

1022
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:57,254
What are we starting over?

1023
01:10:57,463 --> 01:11:01,050
--Huh?
--Why do you assume it's been difficult?

1024
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:03,260
What do you even know about me, Dad?!

1025
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:06,305
--Ren...
--Don't act like you know me,
when you don't know anything!

1026
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:08,349
Ren, I wasn't...

1027
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:20,486
Of course you don't know anything.
I haven't told you anything.

1028
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:22,738
I'm sorry. I don't think I'll come over tonight.

1029
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,074
--What about supper?
--That's okay.

1030
01:11:25,282 --> 01:11:28,786
Ren! You can decide what
you're going to do from now on!

1031
01:11:28,994 --> 01:11:30,663
But don't forget!

1032
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:34,291
I'm willing to do anything
in my power to help! So...

1033
01:11:35,501 --> 01:11:37,002
Ren!

1034
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:44,677
What's the matter with me?
Why would I say that to Dad?

1035
01:11:44,885 --> 01:11:47,513
--Don't go!
--Damn it, why does he have to...

1036
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:48,514
Let's start over.

1037
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:49,682
Damn it!

1038
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:50,808
Don't go!

1039
01:11:51,016 --> 01:11:51,850
Damn it!

1040
01:11:52,059 --> 01:11:53,560
I don't get it!

1041
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:16,208
Is that...

1042
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:22,715
I hate them... I... hate them... I... hate them...

1043
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:25,384
...me from back then?

1044
01:12:29,722 --> 01:12:31,223
A hole?

1045
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:34,893
He's gone!

1046
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:05,591
Ren?

1047
01:13:14,266 --> 01:13:18,145
You look so frightening.
It's like you're not even you, Ren.

1048
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:24,109
Tell me, what exactly am I?
Am I human? Or am I beast?

1049
01:13:24,318 --> 01:13:25,444
Beast?

1050
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:28,697
Or am I... some ugly monster?

1051
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:30,449
What are you talking about?

1052
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:34,745
Tell me. Huh? What am I?

1053
01:13:34,953 --> 01:13:36,830
Ren, you're acting weird.

1054
01:13:40,876 --> 01:13:44,296
What am I, exactly? What am I?!

1055
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:58,435
Sometimes the hurt is too much for me, too.

1056
01:13:58,644 --> 01:14:03,106
I think, "I'm <i>through</i> with this."
It feels like my heart will burst.

1057
01:14:04,775 --> 01:14:07,402
It's not just you, Ren, and it's not just me.

1058
01:14:07,611 --> 01:14:11,573
I'm sure it happens to everyone.
So, it's all right.

1059
01:14:11,782 --> 01:14:15,494
So... it's all right.

1060
01:14:22,376 --> 01:14:27,339
Thanks. I feel calm now. I'll go cool off.

1061
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:30,133
Oh, hang on.

1062
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:35,889
It's the bookmark from a book
I liked when I was little.

1063
01:14:36,098 --> 01:14:39,643
This has helped me out a ton.

1064
01:14:39,852 --> 01:14:44,940
If you ever feel like you're out of control,
or the way you just did...

1065
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:46,775
...remember this.

1066
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:48,485
A little charm.

1067
01:14:49,236 --> 01:14:51,113
"Jutengai"

1068
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,242
What is this? What's going on?

1069
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,202
Kyuta!

1070
01:14:57,411 --> 01:14:59,079
Come by and visit!

1071
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:04,418
The lord suddenly set a date,
so the whole town has been abuzz.

1072
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:06,169
A date?

1073
01:15:06,378 --> 01:15:07,462
Make yourself at home, okay?

1074
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:09,631
Thanks, Mommy.

1075
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,802
Tomorrow is the day my daddy and
your teacher have their showdown.

1076
01:15:14,011 --> 01:15:16,138
They're going to decide who the next lord is.

1077
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:18,140
Don't tell me you didn't know.

1078
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:19,975
Actually, we're kind of having a fight.

1079
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:22,728
Things are awkward, and I
haven't seen him in a while.

1080
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:25,022
Oh.

1081
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:28,358
Then again, I haven't seen Daddy, either.

1082
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:30,986
He's been busy with his training all the time.

1083
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:33,697
I miss him, but what can I do?

1084
01:15:33,906 --> 01:15:36,825
You don't want your teacher
to lose, either, do you?

1085
01:15:37,034 --> 01:15:40,996
Then don't keep things awkward
between you; cheer for him.

1086
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:42,122
Yeah.

1087
01:15:42,331 --> 01:15:45,459
Whichever one becomes the lord,
we'll still be friends.

1088
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:46,710
Of course.

1089
01:15:46,919 --> 01:15:48,629
Let's hope it's a good match.

1090
01:15:48,837 --> 01:15:50,714
Yeah.

1091
01:15:50,923 --> 01:15:52,341
Jiromaru...

1092
01:15:52,549 --> 01:15:53,592
Brother!

1093
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,346
You shouldn't bother Kyuta
by keeping him here too long.

1094
01:15:57,554 --> 01:16:00,098
Hear that? The evening
cicadas are already chirping.

1095
01:16:00,307 --> 01:16:02,351
I'll see him to the front gate.

1096
01:16:06,355 --> 01:16:08,523
Thanks. Bye.

1097
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:18,742
A good match? Don't make me laugh.

1098
01:16:18,951 --> 01:16:22,454
We already know who's
gonna win from the outset.

1099
01:16:22,663 --> 01:16:26,708
Small-timers like you,
you human, and Kumatetsu,

1100
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:30,003
should keep your places like
the small-timers that you are!

1101
01:16:32,297 --> 01:16:34,132
Ichirohiko...

1102
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:43,809
Why... do you have a hole like me...?

1103
01:16:44,017 --> 01:16:45,519
Why...?

1104
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,086
Who are you rooting for?

1105
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:12,879
Oh, I don't know.

1106
01:17:13,088 --> 01:17:14,089
I'm taking Iozen.

1107
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:15,424
I've got Kumatetsu.

1108
01:17:15,632 --> 01:17:18,051
I... Ah! I can't decide!

1109
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:20,762
I have agonized! For these last nine years,

1110
01:17:20,971 --> 01:17:23,640
I've agonized, and agonized,
and agonized some more.

1111
01:17:23,849 --> 01:17:26,226
At last, I've made up my mind.

1112
01:17:26,435 --> 01:17:29,396
So, what god are you going to become?

1113
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:32,107
Indubitably, a god of decision-making!

1114
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,570
The reincarnation ceremony
will take place after the match,

1115
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:38,530
so look forward to that.

1116
01:17:38,739 --> 01:17:44,077
We will now hold the ceremony
to decide Jutengai's new lord!

1117
01:17:44,286 --> 01:17:46,621
Candidates, step forward!

1118
01:17:58,258 --> 01:18:02,512
Wow! You can tell just from the pupils'
faces that this is clearly a mismatch!

1119
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:04,639
If only Kyuta were here.

1120
01:18:04,848 --> 01:18:08,727
Kumatetsu, don't look so glum.
The match is about to start.

1121
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:14,983
Ah, pipe down!

1122
01:18:26,953 --> 01:18:31,208
In accordance with rules of etiquette,
swords will remain in their sheaths.

1123
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:33,126
Drawing them is not permitted.

1124
01:18:33,335 --> 01:18:34,711
If you run away, you will lose,

1125
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:38,298
and if you are knocked out
for a count of ten, you will lose.

1126
01:18:38,507 --> 01:18:41,927
All other rules of etiquette
will be strictly observed.

1127
01:18:42,135 --> 01:18:44,221
Contestants ready!

1128
01:18:50,852 --> 01:18:52,354
Begin!

1129
01:18:55,732 --> 01:18:57,234
Right out of the gate?!

1130
01:18:58,777 --> 01:18:59,820
Kumatetsu is overpowering him!

1131
01:19:00,028 --> 01:19:02,531
The bastard isn't even considering stamina!

1132
01:19:05,117 --> 01:19:05,909
Daddy!

1133
01:19:06,118 --> 01:19:07,619
Shut up and watch!

1134
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:29,975
There, you see?

1135
01:19:50,078 --> 01:19:51,580
Aw, crap!

1136
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,003
That's Father for you!

1137
01:20:02,716 --> 01:20:03,842
This ain't good.

1138
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:06,052
He's getting beaten up for nothing.

1139
01:20:08,305 --> 01:20:09,264
Is this...

1140
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:10,974
...already over?

1141
01:20:12,392 --> 01:20:14,519
Are you finished already, Kumatetsu?!

1142
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,864
One!

1143
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:27,949
Two!

1144
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:30,076
Three!

1145
01:20:30,285 --> 01:20:32,078
Four!

1146
01:20:32,287 --> 01:20:34,247
Five!

1147
01:20:34,456 --> 01:20:36,208
--Six!
--Crap!

1148
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:38,376
Seven!

1149
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:40,629
Eight!

1150
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:41,630
Kyuta!

1151
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:43,465
N--

1152
01:20:43,673 --> 01:20:46,092
--It's Kyuta!
--He's Kumatetsu's best pupil!

1153
01:20:46,301 --> 01:20:47,802
<i>Him</i>?

1154
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,181
Kyuta...

1155
01:20:52,474 --> 01:20:53,600
Kyuta, please!

1156
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:55,685
Encourage Kumatetsu!

1157
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:00,315
What are you doing, you chump?!

1158
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,400
Get up, already!

1159
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:07,072
You've got a lot of nerve showing
your face here, after walking out!

1160
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,282
What about you?! You look ridiculous!

1161
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:10,659
What did you say, you bastard?

1162
01:21:10,867 --> 01:21:13,703
--You're a disgrace!
--Now is not the time to be insulting each other!

1163
01:21:13,912 --> 01:21:16,998
Give me a break! Why are
these two always like this?!

1164
01:21:17,207 --> 01:21:20,210
Don't go acting depressed!
Beat him, even if you are alone!

1165
01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:26,675
Ha! I don't need you sticking your
nose in here to keep me from losing!

1166
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:38,311
What?!

1167
01:21:42,691 --> 01:21:43,775
So, he's still up for this?

1168
01:21:43,984 --> 01:21:46,111
This is starting to get good!

1169
01:21:54,536 --> 01:21:57,706
From the right! Sway! Counter!

1170
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,792
You can do it! Middle guard!

1171
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:06,589
Look at that. The guy is smiling!

1172
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:09,884
That's the look he has on his face
when he's training with Kyuta.

1173
01:22:10,093 --> 01:22:12,762
You're kidding me.
He's in the middle of a match!

1174
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:17,267
Right now, his mind is in a place that
transcends the opponent before him.

1175
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:21,187
It truly is perfect concentration--
a rising above the self.

1176
01:22:21,396 --> 01:22:23,398
On his own, Kumatetsu doesn't
have a chance of winning.

1177
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:26,901
However, with the two of them, who knows?

1178
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:30,071
Daddy, hang in there!

1179
01:22:32,741 --> 01:22:34,326
Ah! He's losing!

1180
01:22:34,534 --> 01:22:36,286
Shut up!

1181
01:22:36,494 --> 01:22:38,204
Brother?!

1182
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:39,706
Kyuta...

1183
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:43,251
That bastard! He's just a human!

1184
01:22:47,714 --> 01:22:50,050
Don't let him push you around!
Stop losing to him!

1185
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:52,218
Use your freakish strength!

1186
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:05,231
Now!

1187
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:07,734
What?!

1188
01:23:13,698 --> 01:23:16,409
Right there!

1189
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:32,217
One!

1190
01:23:32,425 --> 01:23:34,010
Two!

1191
01:23:34,219 --> 01:23:35,804
Three!

1192
01:23:36,012 --> 01:23:37,555
Four!

1193
01:23:37,764 --> 01:23:39,307
Five!

1194
01:23:39,516 --> 01:23:41,101
Six!

1195
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:42,811
Seven!

1196
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:44,521
Eight!

1197
01:23:44,729 --> 01:23:46,314
Nine!

1198
01:23:46,523 --> 01:23:48,274
Ten!

1199
01:23:48,483 --> 01:23:51,903
The match is decided for Kumatetsu!

1200
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:14,008
Don't make me nervous like that.

1201
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:16,261
I never asked you to worry about me.

1202
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:17,971
You're lucky to have won.

1203
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:19,681
Of course I was gonna win.

1204
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:21,933
Don't be absurd. You were as limp as a rag.

1205
01:24:22,142 --> 01:24:23,643
Stuff it.

1206
01:24:31,693 --> 01:24:35,155
It's the rise of a new lord!

1207
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:42,495
Banzai! Banzai!

1208
01:24:42,704 --> 01:24:44,122
You're a good son.

1209
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:45,748
Huh?

1210
01:24:45,957 --> 01:24:47,459
Let's go.

1211
01:24:51,379 --> 01:24:55,383
Hmm? The sword... It's gone.

1212
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:08,688
What's... that red stuff...?

1213
01:25:10,315 --> 01:25:11,733
Kyuta...

1214
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:13,610
What's going on?

1215
01:25:18,615 --> 01:25:22,952
Father! My telekinesis and your
sword have won the match!

1216
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:28,374
You win! There's no way that
small-timer could beat you!

1217
01:25:28,583 --> 01:25:31,085
Isn't that right, Kyuta?

1218
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:33,296
Isn't that right?!

1219
01:25:35,048 --> 01:25:36,591
Stop, Ichirohiko!

1220
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:41,054
Father, I'm about to finish him off.
Watch this, please!

1221
01:25:52,482 --> 01:25:55,068
Did you see that, Kyuta?! That's what you get!

1222
01:25:55,276 --> 01:25:57,862
You see? The winner is my father, Iozen!

1223
01:25:58,071 --> 01:26:00,949
You fool! Do you think
anyone will recognize this?!

1224
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:10,875
W-What is that?!

1225
01:26:11,084 --> 01:26:13,628
--A hole?
--No, Kyuta!

1226
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,845
How dare you...

1227
01:26:23,054 --> 01:26:24,764
How dare you?!

1228
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:26,724
Kyuta! Reject the darkness!

1229
01:26:26,933 --> 01:26:27,809
Brother!

1230
01:26:28,017 --> 01:26:31,062
Don't do this, Kyuta! Ah, this is a disaster!

1231
01:26:52,166 --> 01:26:53,710
Kyuta...

1232
01:26:54,961 --> 01:26:56,921
...you...

1233
01:26:57,130 --> 01:27:00,758
The darkness... is taking over Ichirohiko.

1234
01:27:01,843 --> 01:27:03,636
...will pay.

1235
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:12,645
Brother? Where are you?

1236
01:27:12,854 --> 01:27:14,355
Brother!

1237
01:27:18,026 --> 01:27:19,193
Hey...

1238
01:27:19,402 --> 01:27:22,280
...what are you... taking a nap for...?

1239
01:27:22,488 --> 01:27:24,782
Get... up...

1240
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:32,707
Kyuta...

1241
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:34,542
Kyuta!

1242
01:27:34,751 --> 01:27:36,836
You're late! Late, late, late, late!

1243
01:27:37,045 --> 01:27:39,797
What are you doing? We've got training!

1244
01:27:48,181 --> 01:27:49,682
Chico...

1245
01:27:51,851 --> 01:27:53,645
What's the matter, Chico?

1246
01:28:17,251 --> 01:28:21,422
I'm sorry, Ichirohiko. I'm sorry.

1247
01:28:21,631 --> 01:28:26,135
That power of Ichirohiko's is
definitely not beast telekinesis.

1248
01:28:26,344 --> 01:28:28,971
It is clearly a power
brought about by the darkness

1249
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:31,599
that only dwells within human hearts.

1250
01:28:31,808 --> 01:28:36,646
Lord, did you already know the truth?

1251
01:28:36,854 --> 01:28:40,024
Iozen, tell me why you did it.

1252
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:07,009
I'm sure his real parents must
have had some pretty good reasons.

1253
01:29:07,218 --> 01:29:10,722
I decided to raise him in secret.

1254
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:13,808
I knew that humans had darkness
dwelling within their hearts,

1255
01:29:14,016 --> 01:29:16,644
but I thought that if I raised him,
he would be all right.

1256
01:29:16,853 --> 01:29:20,606
Looking back on it now,
though, that was conceit.

1257
01:29:20,815 --> 01:29:22,859
It was my own arrogance.

1258
01:29:24,318 --> 01:29:27,905
Why don't I have tusks like you do, Father?

1259
01:29:28,114 --> 01:29:31,576
Don't worry about that.
They will grow in, in time.

1260
01:29:31,784 --> 01:29:35,621
Why doesn't my nose grow
out long, like yours does?

1261
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:38,374
Not to worry. Someday, it will.

1262
01:29:39,417 --> 01:29:42,253
Father, what exactly am I?

1263
01:29:42,462 --> 01:29:45,089
Ichirohiko, you are my boy.

1264
01:29:45,298 --> 01:29:49,761
You are the son of Iozen, and no one else.

1265
01:29:50,928 --> 01:29:54,974
The more you tried to convince
him he was the son of a beast,

1266
01:29:55,183 --> 01:29:57,143
the more Ichirohiko lost trust in himself,

1267
01:29:57,351 --> 01:30:00,772
which made the darkness grow ever deeper.

1268
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:03,983
But to think that the
atmosphere of the beast world

1269
01:30:04,192 --> 01:30:08,446
could expose the hole in a
human's heart so dramatically...

1270
01:30:08,654 --> 01:30:11,032
What is the darkness?

1271
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,534
I'm dumb, so I don't get it.

1272
01:30:13,743 --> 01:30:16,370
I don't care where Brother came from.

1273
01:30:16,579 --> 01:30:18,748
To me, Brother is just Brother.

1274
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:20,416
Jiromaru...

1275
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:26,422
Lord, will we not be allowed
to live together with Ichirohiko?

1276
01:30:26,631 --> 01:30:29,509
Is there no hope of us starting over now?

1277
01:30:29,717 --> 01:30:32,929
Right now, Ichirohiko is wandering, lost.

1278
01:30:33,137 --> 01:30:36,933
Until we can drive that
darkness from Ichirohiko,

1279
01:30:37,141 --> 01:30:40,019
nothing will be possible.

1280
01:30:43,272 --> 01:30:44,774
Kyuta!

1281
01:30:46,651 --> 01:30:49,445
Are you just going to leave Kumatetsu?

1282
01:30:51,656 --> 01:30:56,577
You fool! Are you out for vengeance?!
What good will that do?!

1283
01:30:56,786 --> 01:30:57,912
H-Hey, Hyakushubo...

1284
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,330
I can't stand it anymore!

1285
01:30:59,539 --> 01:31:02,750
If you think I'll always be a pushover,
you're greatly mistaken!

1286
01:31:02,959 --> 01:31:07,004
Haven't you learned a thing from seeing
what happened to Kumatetsu, you idiot?!

1287
01:31:16,931 --> 01:31:19,308
So you're still going to go, then?

1288
01:31:21,978 --> 01:31:23,771
Thank you for chewing me out.

1289
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:26,774
It helped me clarify my thoughts.

1290
01:31:26,983 --> 01:31:29,610
However, I'm not going for vengeance.

1291
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:32,613
Ichirohiko and I are a lot alike,
and if I had slipped up,

1292
01:31:32,822 --> 01:31:35,575
I might have turned out like he did.

1293
01:31:35,783 --> 01:31:37,368
The reason why that didn't happen

1294
01:31:37,577 --> 01:31:41,289
was because of the many people
who helped raise me.

1295
01:31:41,497 --> 01:31:45,459
Mr. Tata, Mr. Hyaku, and all the others.

1296
01:31:45,668 --> 01:31:48,212
Kyuta... you...

1297
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:51,507
But I can't pretend it's not my problem.

1298
01:31:51,716 --> 01:31:56,804
Ichirohiko's problem is my problem, too. So...

1299
01:31:57,013 --> 01:32:01,142
...I have to go. I ask that you look after him.

1300
01:32:03,978 --> 01:32:07,899
Yeah, all right! I can see how resolved you are!

1301
01:32:08,107 --> 01:32:09,817
You let us take care of Kumatetsu!

1302
01:32:10,026 --> 01:32:15,031
We'll see him through!
So you go on! Go on, now!

1303
01:32:33,633 --> 01:32:38,262
The many people who helped raise him, huh?

1304
01:32:38,471 --> 01:32:42,099
Who'd have ever guessed
that would include us?

1305
01:32:42,308 --> 01:32:45,978
We've been with Kyuta ever since
he was a little boy, after all.

1306
01:32:46,187 --> 01:32:50,399
Yeah. At first, he was a
smart-mouthed, nasty little brat.

1307
01:32:50,608 --> 01:32:54,403
Rain or shine, we went over every day,
never getting enough of it.

1308
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:58,449
We looked after him, and he
never once seemed grateful.

1309
01:32:58,658 --> 01:33:01,869
And before we knew it, he had grown so big.

1310
01:33:02,078 --> 01:33:04,830
He always did talk a pretty good game.

1311
01:33:07,667 --> 01:33:08,960
It makes you proud, huh?

1312
01:33:09,168 --> 01:33:11,003
It makes you proud.

1313
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:17,259
Kumatetsu!

1314
01:33:37,488 --> 01:33:38,447
"Public Telephone"

1315
01:33:38,447 --> 01:33:40,366
"Missed calls: 1"

1316
01:33:40,366 --> 01:33:40,408
Ren...

1317
01:33:58,009 --> 01:34:00,553
I want you to hold on to this.

1318
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:03,389
Why? How come?

1319
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:06,350
There's someone that I
have to settle matters with.

1320
01:34:06,559 --> 01:34:08,310
I'm not sure whether or not I can beat him.

1321
01:34:08,519 --> 01:34:12,565
If I lose, it could be the end
of everything. That's why.

1322
01:34:12,773 --> 01:34:14,358
No...

1323
01:34:14,567 --> 01:34:16,235
I'm glad I met you, Kaede.

1324
01:34:16,444 --> 01:34:19,947
Thanks to you, I learned lots
of things that I didn't know.

1325
01:34:20,156 --> 01:34:23,367
You really made me realize
that the world is a big place.

1326
01:34:23,576 --> 01:34:25,745
What are you talking about?
There's still so much to...

1327
01:34:25,953 --> 01:34:29,582
I'm glad to have been able to study with you.

1328
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:32,376
So, I wanted to say thanks.

1329
01:34:32,585 --> 01:34:37,923
Wait... No, I won't! I won't have this...

1330
01:34:40,801 --> 01:34:42,470
Kyuta!

1331
01:34:46,015 --> 01:34:48,559
You're going to pay.

1332
01:34:48,768 --> 01:34:50,936
You're just a human...

1333
01:34:51,145 --> 01:34:53,022
No, not here!

1334
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:54,732
Is that...?

1335
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,486
You're in danger. Run away.

1336
01:35:02,114 --> 01:35:04,492
What are you waiting for?! Go!

1337
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,368
Mm-mm!

1338
01:35:06,577 --> 01:35:08,162
I'm not letting go!

1339
01:35:11,582 --> 01:35:13,084
Crap.

1340
01:35:16,128 --> 01:35:17,755
Run as fast as you can!

1341
01:35:22,927 --> 01:35:24,428
Stay back!

1342
01:35:31,936 --> 01:35:32,812
Huh? What is this?

1343
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:35,231
Are they shooting a TV show or something?

1344
01:36:14,645 --> 01:36:16,147
Ren!

1345
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:28,576
Damn, it's no good here.
Is there some other place...?

1346
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:36,917
Whale?

1347
01:36:39,587 --> 01:36:42,756
You're in danger! Don't go down that way!

1348
01:36:42,965 --> 01:36:44,466
Hurry and get out of here!

1349
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:52,892
--Hmm?
--What's that?

1350
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:54,602
What's that shadow?

1351
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:08,365
--Is that...?
--Huh?

1352
01:37:08,574 --> 01:37:10,743
A whale...?

1353
01:37:24,798 --> 01:37:27,509
Get out of your cars! Just do it!

1354
01:37:38,896 --> 01:37:39,772
What is that?!

1355
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:42,650
Hey, get out of here! Run, fast!

1356
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:46,362
Run!

1357
01:37:49,114 --> 01:37:50,616
Kaede!

1358
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:13,597
How am I supposed to defeat him?

1359
01:38:15,849 --> 01:38:17,685
This way!

1360
01:38:17,893 --> 01:38:19,395
Where are you going?!

1361
01:38:41,834 --> 01:38:43,377
"Ginza Line service interrupted"

1362
01:38:43,377 --> 01:38:47,214
"Service on all lines interrupted"

1363
01:38:47,589 --> 01:38:48,299
"Train arriving on Track #6"

1364
01:38:48,674 --> 01:38:49,383
"Train arriving on Track #6"

1365
01:38:49,758 --> 01:38:50,467
"Train arriving on Track #6"

1366
01:38:54,096 --> 01:38:58,100
What do I do to oppose him?

1367
01:38:58,309 --> 01:39:03,230
If I open up my hollow heart,
and lock up all of his darkness inside,

1368
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:07,568
then run myself through with my sword,
will I take it out of this world with me?

1369
01:39:09,069 --> 01:39:13,032
Is that all I can do at this point?

1370
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:18,495
You know what? I've been
asking myself something.

1371
01:39:18,704 --> 01:39:23,959
"Why am I holding Ren's hand
and running away with him?"

1372
01:39:24,168 --> 01:39:27,755
"Here I am, scared to death,
so why am I doing it?"

1373
01:39:27,963 --> 01:39:30,382
Then I remembered something.

1374
01:39:30,591 --> 01:39:36,513
How incredibly happy I was when we
first met and started studying together.

1375
01:39:36,722 --> 01:39:42,394
I mean, there's nobody else who
enjoys studying as much as you.

1376
01:39:42,603 --> 01:39:47,232
When I'm with you, it gives me
the courage to keep going, too.

1377
01:39:47,441 --> 01:39:49,902
And right now, it's the same.

1378
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:53,989
Ren, if you're going to fight,
then I'm staying with you.

1379
01:39:54,198 --> 01:40:00,537
Don't forget-neither of us
is ever fighting alone.

1380
01:40:00,746 --> 01:40:02,956
Kaede...

1381
01:40:03,165 --> 01:40:05,084
We have an announcement to make.

1382
01:40:05,292 --> 01:40:07,419
Due to a rash of fires near Shibuya Station,

1383
01:40:07,628 --> 01:40:10,589
this train will suspend operations
at this station, and briefly--

1384
01:40:16,387 --> 01:40:17,763
What is all this shaking?

1385
01:40:17,971 --> 01:40:21,683
Ichirohiko is after Kyuta, and is
rampaging through the human city!

1386
01:40:21,892 --> 01:40:24,770
How could the sympathetic
vibration of our worlds

1387
01:40:24,978 --> 01:40:27,064
have so great an impact?

1388
01:40:27,272 --> 01:40:31,610
Why must we be dragged into
a conflict between humans?

1389
01:40:31,819 --> 01:40:35,614
It was a mistake to allow humans
into our world in the first place.

1390
01:40:43,414 --> 01:40:46,500
Hey, Kumatetsu! Don't do
anything crazy! You could die!

1391
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:49,086
You can't even move around
very well, you know!

1392
01:40:49,294 --> 01:40:50,379
Shut up.

1393
01:40:50,587 --> 01:40:55,509
I heard what was happening.
I have to do something... I have to...

1394
01:40:55,717 --> 01:40:57,177
Kumatetsu...

1395
01:40:57,386 --> 01:40:59,388
What do you think you can do?!

1396
01:40:59,596 --> 01:41:04,059
Lord, you're the only one.
Only you can do anything about this.

1397
01:41:04,268 --> 01:41:07,563
But you're keeping the means
to do it all to yourself.

1398
01:41:07,771 --> 01:41:08,981
Means, did he say?

1399
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:11,692
What means could there be?

1400
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:15,320
Kyuta thinks he can stand
on his own two feet already,

1401
01:41:15,529 --> 01:41:18,991
but really he still needs someone to help him.

1402
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:24,538
I may be a small-time chump,
but I'm still gonna help him.

1403
01:41:24,746 --> 01:41:29,168
I'll make up for what's missing inside his heart.

1404
01:41:29,376 --> 01:41:34,131
That's the one thing that
this small-timer can still do!

1405
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:44,683
Hmm... Imagine, you being
one to say such a thing!

1406
01:41:44,892 --> 01:41:49,605
You see, he's asking me to turn
over my right to be reincarnated.

1407
01:41:49,813 --> 01:41:51,982
You want to be reborn as a god?!

1408
01:41:52,191 --> 01:41:55,110
Ridiculous! No normal beast can do that!

1409
01:41:55,319 --> 01:41:58,280
That's something you have to be a lord to do...

1410
01:42:00,908 --> 01:42:01,867
What just happened?

1411
01:42:02,075 --> 01:42:04,786
Kumatetsu is the lord.

1412
01:42:04,995 --> 01:42:06,955
Listen closely, Kumatetsu.

1413
01:42:07,164 --> 01:42:10,667
Once you make up your mind,
there's no going back.

1414
01:42:10,876 --> 01:42:12,920
Are you all right with that?

1415
01:42:17,799 --> 01:42:23,222
Look at you. There's not a hint
of hesitation in your eyes.

1416
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:38,362
It's Ichirohiko.

1417
01:42:39,530 --> 01:42:41,031
He's gone...

1418
01:42:55,963 --> 01:42:57,464
Damn it!

1419
01:43:07,933 --> 01:43:11,103
Get out of here, Kaede. I'm the one he's after.

1420
01:43:12,521 --> 01:43:14,565
Kaede!

1421
01:43:14,773 --> 01:43:18,652
What is it you want to do?
Rip a hated opponent to shreds?

1422
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:22,322
Trample him, dominate him?
Will that satisfy you?

1423
01:43:22,531 --> 01:43:24,741
You may look like a whale,

1424
01:43:24,950 --> 01:43:27,786
but you're really a human,
possessed with revenge!

1425
01:43:27,995 --> 01:43:30,831
Every one of us carries that darkness equally.

1426
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:34,459
Ren has it too! And so do I!

1427
01:43:34,668 --> 01:43:39,756
But I'm still struggling
as hard as I can, even now.

1428
01:43:39,965 --> 01:43:43,760
That's why there's no way
that Ren can lose to you,

1429
01:43:43,969 --> 01:43:46,847
who were so easily swallowed by the darkness.

1430
01:43:47,055 --> 01:43:49,725
There's no way that we're going to lose!

1431
01:43:52,894 --> 01:43:54,396
Kaede!

1432
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:03,405
Ren!

1433
01:44:03,614 --> 01:44:04,531
There's no other choice.

1434
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:06,908
Ichirohiko! Watch!

1435
01:44:11,872 --> 01:44:14,958
I'm going to take all of
your darkness inside me!

1436
01:44:29,806 --> 01:44:32,059
Ren, don't tell me you're...

1437
01:44:35,437 --> 01:44:38,523
You can perish along with me!

1438
01:44:38,732 --> 01:44:40,192
Ren!

1439
01:44:43,028 --> 01:44:44,738
Don't let him beat you!

1440
01:44:48,283 --> 01:44:50,285
--Kyuta!
--Huh?!

1441
01:45:04,091 --> 01:45:05,384
That's...

1442
01:45:05,592 --> 01:45:07,969
Kyuta! That's Kumatetsu!

1443
01:45:08,178 --> 01:45:09,638
He was reincarnated as an artifact spirit,

1444
01:45:09,846 --> 01:45:12,808
and changed his form into that longsword!

1445
01:45:13,016 --> 01:45:16,853
That... is him?

1446
01:45:17,062 --> 01:45:20,982
That old bastard said he'd become
the sword inside your heart!

1447
01:45:21,191 --> 01:45:24,069
The sword inside my heart?

1448
01:45:24,277 --> 01:45:26,780
You've got a sword in your heart, don't you?!

1449
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:28,865
Yeah, right! Are you kidding?

1450
01:45:29,074 --> 01:45:31,702
The sword in your heart is important!

1451
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:34,996
Right in here!

1452
01:45:44,798 --> 01:45:48,427
I expected no less.
I'm liking you more and more!

1453
01:45:51,513 --> 01:45:53,974
Then from now on, you'll be "Kyuta."

1454
01:45:56,810 --> 01:46:01,273
All right, Kyuta, brace yourself,
because I'm gonna train you hard!

1455
01:46:19,082 --> 01:46:20,417
Kyuta!

1456
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:23,253
What are you crying for, you chump?!

1457
01:46:23,462 --> 01:46:25,756
I can't stand blubberers!

1458
01:46:31,219 --> 01:46:33,305
Shut up! I'm not crying!

1459
01:46:48,487 --> 01:46:49,988
Build up your energy!

1460
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:54,034
--Kyuta...
--Ren...

1461
01:46:58,538 --> 01:47:01,541
Not yet! Hone it even sharper!

1462
01:47:07,088 --> 01:47:08,590
Is that...?

1463
01:47:17,682 --> 01:47:21,478
Right at the moment he leaps,
Ichirohiko's human form always appears.

1464
01:47:21,686 --> 01:47:23,188
If that's the case...

1465
01:47:25,232 --> 01:47:26,817
Focus on just that one point!

1466
01:47:27,025 --> 01:47:29,611
Then don't hesitate to pick him off!

1467
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:42,999
Now! Go!

1468
01:48:29,546 --> 01:48:31,840
Did he... kill him?

1469
01:48:32,048 --> 01:48:33,425
No.

1470
01:48:33,633 --> 01:48:35,135
Huh?

1471
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:41,766
Just a... human...

1472
01:48:43,351 --> 01:48:45,145
Ichirohiko...

1473
01:48:45,353 --> 01:48:47,355
...you're the same as me.

1474
01:48:50,984 --> 01:48:54,654
The child of a beast, raised by a beast.

1475
01:49:13,506 --> 01:49:15,425
Where in the world...

1476
01:49:17,010 --> 01:49:18,511
...am I?

1477
01:49:20,096 --> 01:49:24,601
Father... Mother... Jiromaru...

1478
01:49:24,809 --> 01:49:27,812
What was I doing before now?

1479
01:49:28,021 --> 01:49:31,149
I remember going to the
stadium with everyone...

1480
01:49:39,532 --> 01:49:42,452
This is Kyuta's...

1481
01:49:57,968 --> 01:49:59,678
Remember, Kyuta...

1482
01:49:59,886 --> 01:50:03,515
...I'm the type who sticks to his guns
once he decides something.

1483
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:06,059
I know.

1484
01:50:06,267 --> 01:50:09,729
You start wandering around lost,
and I'll kick your ass from inside your heart.

1485
01:50:09,938 --> 01:50:12,023
Shut up. I won't wander.

1486
01:50:12,232 --> 01:50:13,942
That's the stuff.

1487
01:50:15,568 --> 01:50:18,571
You just keep quiet and watch
what I do from in there.

1488
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:21,992
Yeah. Why don't you show me what you've got?

1489
01:50:46,558 --> 01:50:50,145
Last night, an unmanned tractor trailer
went out of control in Shibuya,

1490
01:50:50,353 --> 01:50:52,480
causing a large explosion.

1491
01:50:52,689 --> 01:50:56,192
Many sustained injuries
as they got out of the way,

1492
01:50:56,192 --> 01:50:57,110
"Explosion in Shibuya"

1493
01:50:57,110 --> 01:50:58,445
but we're told they were all minor.

1494
01:50:58,653 --> 01:51:02,490
According to police, a large number
of people reported seeing

1495
01:51:02,699 --> 01:51:04,451
the "shadow of a whale"
just before the incident,

1496
01:51:04,659 --> 01:51:07,245
but nothing was seen on security cameras--

1497
01:51:15,211 --> 01:51:16,629
Take a good look.

1498
01:51:16,838 --> 01:51:20,175
Even Kyuta there started out
as just a weak little child.

1499
01:51:20,383 --> 01:51:23,136
What he's saying is, if you train hard every day,

1500
01:51:23,344 --> 01:51:27,807
even you snot-nosed little beasts
can someday grow up to be like him.

1501
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:30,810
Maybe.

1502
01:51:31,019 --> 01:51:32,687
Right, maybe.

1503
01:51:34,105 --> 01:51:39,027
Thanks to Kumatetsu, my chance to
be reborn as a god has slipped away.

1504
01:51:39,235 --> 01:51:42,572
Now I'm back to my old job as lord.

1505
01:51:42,781 --> 01:51:45,909
Now, now, today's event is to celebrate Kyuta.

1506
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:48,078
--Here's to him!
--Hmm?

1507
01:51:48,286 --> 01:51:50,288
Oh! Look at that!

1508
01:51:50,497 --> 01:51:55,376
That young lady is yet another
person who supported Kyuta.

1509
01:51:56,586 --> 01:51:58,922
Kaede? What are you doing here?

1510
01:52:00,381 --> 01:52:03,051
I was invited. Oh, here.

1511
01:52:03,259 --> 01:52:06,346
I dropped it during everything,
and had to look hard to find it.

1512
01:52:06,554 --> 01:52:08,056
Here, you can have it back.

1513
01:52:09,516 --> 01:52:10,308
Thanks.

1514
01:52:10,517 --> 01:52:13,186
Also, I have this. A test request form.

1515
01:52:13,394 --> 01:52:15,980
What will you do?
Do you still feel like taking it?

1516
01:52:18,316 --> 01:52:20,860
You get to choose what
you're going to do, Ren.

1517
01:52:23,071 --> 01:52:24,614
I'll take it.

1518
01:52:24,823 --> 01:52:26,533
Hooray!

1519
01:52:26,741 --> 01:52:30,203
I knew you were going to!
Let's work hard on it, together!

1520
01:52:30,411 --> 01:52:32,622
Here come the fireworks!

1521
01:53:04,279 --> 01:53:05,780
Yo!

1522
01:53:10,285 --> 01:53:15,957
After that, Kyuta left Jutengai,
and never picked up a sword again.

1523
01:53:16,166 --> 01:53:18,668
But he's the greatest swordsman of them all.

1524
01:53:18,877 --> 01:53:25,341
Yes. The only one to carry the sword
that was Kumatetsu in his heart.

1525
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:29,262
Knowing him, whatever hardships
he may face from here on,

1526
01:53:29,470 --> 01:53:31,556
he's sure to pull through them.

1527
01:53:39,397 --> 01:53:41,733
Good for you, Ren.

1528
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:44,796
<i>With my concealed shotgun
I'll shoot the swollen head of the monster</i>

1529
01:54:45,004 --> 01:54:57,850
<i>This time, I want to pull the trigger
without any hesitation</i>

1530
01:54:58,059 --> 01:55:03,815
<i>What is he? Vanity?</i>

1531
01:55:04,023 --> 01:55:09,445
<i>The fear of failure?</i>

1532
01:55:09,654 --> 01:55:21,457
<i>Or pride flattered, unsettled, and bloated?</i>

1533
01:55:21,666 --> 01:55:28,589
<i>Now, time to calm my ragged breathing</i>

1534
01:55:28,798 --> 01:55:35,972
<i>Concentrate my awareness on my fingertips</i>

1535
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:42,145
<i>A gunshot roars through this world
that admits no one but me</i>

1536
01:55:42,353 --> 01:55:48,401
<i>There's a brief, dazzling flash</i>

1537
01:55:48,609 --> 01:55:53,906
<i>"One thing ends, and another begins"</i>

1538
01:55:54,115 --> 01:56:02,373
<i>Yes, surely that's what
the light is shouting to me</i>

1539
01:56:13,343 --> 01:56:19,223
<i>In the cornered monster's eyes</i>

1540
01:56:19,432 --> 01:56:25,521
<i>I find loneliness and purity</i>

1541
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:31,319
<i>Like an abandoned kitten</i>

1542
01:56:31,527 --> 01:56:37,158
<i>He curls up in a ball, afraid</i>

1543
01:56:37,367 --> 01:56:50,797
<i>Ah, if only I could have roped and tamed him</i>

1544
01:56:51,005 --> 01:56:56,719
<i>Surrounded by infinite choices and possibilities</i>

1545
01:56:56,928 --> 01:57:03,184
<i>What I've sought and desired starts to blur</i>

1546
01:57:03,393 --> 01:57:08,689
<i>"One thing is born, and another dies away"</i>

1547
01:57:08,898 --> 01:57:18,116
<i>Yes, surely there's no escaping that fact</i>

1548
01:57:18,324 --> 01:57:24,622
<i>On a too-tranquil evening,
in the still of the night</i>

1549
01:57:24,831 --> 01:57:28,334
<i>The monster rampages again</i>

1550
01:57:30,628 --> 01:57:37,135
<i>I load the magazine with hushed breath</i>

1551
01:57:37,343 --> 01:57:45,977
<i>So he won't notice this quiet bloodlust</i>

1552
01:57:46,185 --> 01:57:53,109
<i>Another gunshot roars through this world
that admits no one but me</i>

1553
01:57:53,317 --> 01:57:59,282
<i>There's a brief, dazzling flash</i>

1554
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:04,787
<i>"One thing ends, and another begins"</i>

1555
01:58:04,996 --> 01:58:11,878
<i>This world has always been this way</i>

1556
01:58:12,086 --> 01:58:18,009
<i>"One thing ends, and another begins"</i>

1557
01:58:18,217 --> 01:58:26,559
<i>I'm sure of it</i>
