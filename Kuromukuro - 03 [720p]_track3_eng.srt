00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,070
OP

2
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,680
ED

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,070
Signs

4
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,770
They were discovered 60 years ago...

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,870
Things that couldn't be deciphered or explained using the science and technology of the time.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,800
A cube and a giant,

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,250
two mystical objects of unknown origin that came to be called artifacts.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,730
As they were valuable assets for all of humanity—

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,080
assets that nations around the globe didn't want Japan monopolizing—

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,340
it was decided that they be placed under the control of the United Nations.

11
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,340
A massive research facility was constructed in the area the artifacts were discovered,

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,280
scientists from all across the globe were gathered there to study them,

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,440
and the results of those studies were all made public.

14
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,770
Unmanned?

15
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,460
Yes.

16
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,590
The unit we destroyed here

17
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,800
shows no sign of having been piloted by a living being.

18
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,960
Was the big one that fought the artifact also unmanned?

19
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,660
We don't know.

20
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,910
Are we sure that six of those big ones landed all over the world?

21
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,630
Yes.

22
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,890
Based on the various reports, 
that seems to be the case.

23
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,020
All of them appear to have descended from satellite orbits.

24
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,050
Some of the smaller Cactus units we let escape are on the run in the mountains.

25
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,980
The JSDF is currently on the hunt for them.

26
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,500
Uh, where are we going?

27
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,590
Is that...

28
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,050
Azumi Castle?

29
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,990
Where have all the residents gone?

30
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,900
Probably ran away.

31
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,160
Impossible.

32
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,690
I am Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma, 
retainer to the Washiba Clan.

33
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,380
I am fully aware of my discourtesy, but I still ask of you:

34
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,250
May I speak to someone?

35
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,300
Is anybody there?

36
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,930
Like I said, nobody's home.

37
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,800
Who's the castle lord now?

38
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,610
Jinbo? Uesugi?

39
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,230
Lord? There's no such thing anymore.

40
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,070
Just how much time has passed?!

41
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,960
He really is from the past!

42
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,560
And what is with your appearance?

43
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,470
Huh?

44
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,000
Something wrong with it?

45
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,380
Why are you dressed so outrageously?

46
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,420
Hey, I think it's cute.

47
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,870
I like my school's uniform.

48
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,590
I'm saying a lass should dress more modestly.

49
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,560
Stop it. I don't like that kinda prejudice.

50
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,470
I'm... famished.

51
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,160
Shoot, I need to make dinner for Koharu.

52
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,900
Koharu?

53
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,180
My dear little sister.

54
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,860
I have to make sure that she at least gets to eat proper home cooking.

55
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,880
Going one day without food won't kill her.

56
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,160
You do realize you brought me here against my will, right?

57
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,670
Yes, and I don't regret it.

58
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,380
Though I do feel a tad bad.

59
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,400
So, uh, can we head back now?

60
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,190
You're a hostage, you know.

61
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,170
What? I've been taken hostage?!

62
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,330
You will stay with me awhile.

63
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,560
I-I can't!

64
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,370
What manner of trickery is this?

65
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,610
It's already nighttime, huh...

66
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,640
Kennosuke, what are you going to do now?

67
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,830
I know not!

68
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,120
You insist on standing in my way?

69
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,560
We cannot let you leave here alive.

70
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,690
Draw!

71
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,990
You will come to regret making me draw my sword.

72
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,500
I'd like to watch the news.

73
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,470
But that's boring.

74
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,960
Just a bit, okay?

75
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,870
Please!

76
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,190
Fine, but only for a bit.

77
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,150
{\an8}This is live footage from the Toyama Castle courtyard.

78
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,040
{\an8}Can you see those two?

79
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,420
- Yukina?!

80
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,420
- Yukina?!

81
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,310
Hello?

82
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,500
Are you okay?!

83
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,870
Yeah, I'm okay. Don't worry.

84
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,380
Are you really, really okay?!

85
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,910
Oh, shut up already.

86
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,770
Why are you talking to a box?

87
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,090
Put him on.

88
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,210
You seriously wanna talk to him?

89
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,810
Put. Him. On.

90
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,260
Here.

91
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,090
Like this.

92
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,790
Give Yukina back!

93
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,010
The box talked?!

94
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,710
Who the hell are you?!

95
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,220
Her mother!

96
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,040
How in the world did you get in there?

97
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,740
She's not.

98
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,870
Wait, is this box your mother?!

99
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,770
Don't tell me, you were born from this thing?

100
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,440
Oh, please. Move on.

101
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,780
I'm sorry, Lady of the Box, but I cannot return her at the moment.

102
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,200
You'd better not have done anything to her!

103
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,520
I wouldn't lay a hand on any women or children!

104
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,870
Damn it!

105
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,880
What? Why won't it work?

106
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,010
Can we lug this thing back?

107
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,470
I don't know...

108
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,690
Even back when it was found, nobody could move it due to its weight.

109
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,170
Well, it does weigh 300 tons.

110
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,820
Maybe the GAUS trailers can handle it.

111
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,880
How does this thing even work?

112
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,300
Maybe the pilot is the key?

113
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,200
So it won't turn on without that samurai?

114
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,910
Him, and one other.

115
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,790
Kennosuke has broken out.

116
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,280
Again?

117
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,500
That makes it three times now.

118
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,380
Steed!

119
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,050
Why won't it answer me?

120
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,260
Damn it!

121
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,410
Out of the way, woman!

122
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,640
Or you'll get hurt!

123
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,740
Skilled or not, you're still a lass, huh?

124
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,370
He's such a handful.

125
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,070
Pervert! Predator!

126
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,420
Beast!

127
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,000
Curses!

128
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,110
That's the last of the tests, Miss Shirahane,

129
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,680
but you might have to come back for more.

130
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,060
Right...

131
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,560
Oh, Yukina!

132
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,490
There, there.

133
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,990
Looks like you had a rough time.

134
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,830
Uncle.

135
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,820
Yuki!

136
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,410
Koharu? What are you doing here?

137
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,280
Temple food sucks!

138
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,320
Come home already.

139
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,730
I'd love to if I could.

140
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,030
Hey, where's the samurai?

141
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,690
Oh, yeah. Does that guy work here?

142
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,130
He's pretty hot!

143
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,800
D-Don't! He's pretty dangerous! {don't think you need D-D here, if I time it before kf then it might look super awk}

144
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,230
He's a nutcase!

145
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,750
Huh, really?

146
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,100
But hey, guys are better when they have a bit of a wild side.

147
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,560
Wild doesn't even begin to describe him!

148
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,300
Demons and the Sengoku period, huh?

149
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,660
That is if we believe what Yukina heard from him.

150
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,030
Looks like he's from the early Sengoku period, too.

151
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,500
So what, a samurai from 450 years ago came back to life?

152
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,470
You don't believe it, do you?

153
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,210
Actually, it might be related to what Takehito was talking about.

154
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,630
Seriously, I wish he'd left some actual data behind.

155
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,340
So, where is that samurai boy now?

156
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,850
We have him locked up.

157
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,220
But he runs off every time we try to give him a checkup.

158
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,230
He woke up in modern society all of a sudden.

159
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,620
I bet he's finding it hard to believe any of this.

160
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,860
Very well.

161
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,030
Let me try talking to him.

162
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,820
No! He's violent!

163
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,100
It'll be fine.

164
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,290
He won't think I'm a demon looking at the way I'm dressed.

165
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,200
Yuki, did you see the demons too?

166
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,020
Demons?

167
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,920
You mean that massive geoframe?

168
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,400
Nah, the smaller ones.

169
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,420
Smaller ones?

170
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,300
Apparently they've abducted people.

171
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,840
Yeah, yeah. I heard some strange things have been running around.

172
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,310
Oh, it's those things.

173
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,620
I'm Osho Yakushi, and I run a nearby temple.

174
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,010
Would you mind talking to me?

175
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:47,420
They tell me I was asleep for a long, long time, but I don't believe it.

176
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,640
I just can't shake off the feeling that the demons' minions could be trying to deceive me.

177
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,830
I would like to see for myself, but the people here refuse to let me out.

178
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,860
I understand that you're worried,

179
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,450
but so are the people here.

180
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,660
After all, nobody knows a thing about you.

181
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,010
I am a mere soldier!

182
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,340
What are demons?

183
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,830
Demons!

184
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,160
They abduct people, and they raze villages!

185
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,480
Where did they come from?

186
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,500
I know not!

187
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,390
They came raining from the sky.

188
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,050
However, we'd never seen these demons you speak of.

189
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,950
The world has changed drastically from the era you lived in.

190
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,490
But I want you to believe in us, as a fellow human being.

191
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,370
How'd it go?

192
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,600
Status quo, for the time being.

193
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,770
We'll keep both the giant and the samurai here to study them.

194
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,040
Not surprising, considering we know more about the artifacts than anybody else.

195
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,210
Great.

196
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,030
I was worried they'd try to take them apart.

197
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,870
Well, there were some morons who might've suggested it.

198
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,220
Anyway, how's our self-proclaimed samurai doing?

199
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,850
The conversation with the monk seems to have worked.

200
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,680
Apparently he's behaving himself now.

201
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
That's a huge relief.

202
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,730
I was afraid he'd take my brother hostage too.

203
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,820
A kid?

204
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,030
How did you get in here?

205
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,340
Where's your ID?

206
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,370
I don't have one.

207
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,040
Where are your guardians?

208
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,280
Come here.

209
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,620
No! Lemme go!

210
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,600
To think they raised their hands against a child.

211
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,650
They're a disgrace to warriors everywhere.

212
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,310
You must have been scared.

213
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,050
Apologies.

214
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,320
So awesome!

215
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,890
Girly, what is your name?

216
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,180
Koharu!

217
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,090
Oh, you're Yukina's sister?

218
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,760
Might you be the samurai?

219
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,000
The robot samurai, perchance?

220
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,440
Samurai?

221
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,650
I have no lord to serve, though.

222
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,330
What is your good name, samurai?

223
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,450
Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma.

224
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,040
Kennosuke...

225
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,040
That is a pretty awesome name, I daresay.

226
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,140
This was a barrage?

227
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,420
Barrage? It's a dam.

228
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,530
What's up?

229
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,400
The towns have changed completely,

230
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,540
but I see the mountains remain the same.

231
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,570
You should head back.

232
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,890
What? No!

233
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,500
I wanna keep exploring!

234
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,420
What are you gonna do?

235
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,610
There is something I must confirm.

236
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,530
Wait!

237
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,580
Run away!

238
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,500
Kennosuke!

239
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,490
Huh? Where's Koharu?

240
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,580
Didn't she go with you?

241
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,530
She left on another adventure...

242
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,110
Let's go catch her before she gets into any trouble.

243
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,730
We detected just one, right?

244
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,100
Uh, have you seen a girl around nine years old?

245
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,670
Yukina, look.

246
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,800
Kennosuke?

247
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,910
That's him?

248
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,800
Forgive me!

249
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,810
Huh?

250
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,680
I couldn't save her despite being by her side!

251
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,880
What are you talking about?

252
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,340
Koharu was captured by the enemy!

253
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,390
If I start scaring you, feel free to press that thing.

254
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,220
But help me out for now!

255
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,890
What are you going to do?

256
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,880
Save Koharu!

257
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,480
There aren't a lot of Cacti in hiding.

258
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,280
I doubt they pose much of a threat.

259
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,780
What about our samurai boy on the run?

260
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,450
We know where he is.

261
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,460
We'll have him in custody any moment now.

262
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,690
Yukina? What's the matter?

263
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,290
Koharu got what?

264
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,040
Samurai boy!

265
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,560
Unhand those princesses at once!

266
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,340
Koharu got taken away! Aren't you gonna do anything?

267
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,550
Shut it!

268
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,650
We can rescue as many bunnies as we like after we throw him behind bars.

269
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,490
Get over here already—

270
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,960
What the hell?

271
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,080
About time!

272
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,910
You nearly killed me!

273
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,650
I'll have you commit seppuku for that!

274
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,130
I shall gladly disembowel myself if I have erred.

275
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,590
But do not hinder me until I rescue Koharu!

276
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,090
Hey, you shitty samurai!

277
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,020
What're you trying to do?

278
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,470
Save Koharu, is all!

279
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,530
If you even think about escaping,

280
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,970
I'll unload a clip of .45s up your ass!

281
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,600
What's gonna happen to Koharu?

282
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,820
Well...

283
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,680
Place your faith in me.

284
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,160
I'll save her, no matter what!

285
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,430
Oh, thank goodness.

286
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,820
Her phone's still on.

287
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,620
Go left!

288
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,710
She should be around here.

289
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,480
Koharu!

290
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,960
Do you have shit for brains?

291
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,780
This ain't something you can take on with just a sword.

292
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,800
Don't shoot from that close.

293
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,060
Outta the way, samurai!

294
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,280
Yuki!

295
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,200
Koharu!

296
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,600
There's no mistaking it.

297
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,670
So I really have been asleep for a long time.

298
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,780
Kennosuke?

299
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,620
Let's go.

300
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:55,590
I'll let you off the hook this time out of respect for your bravery and shit.

301
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,200
Koharu! My baby!

302
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,350
Are you hurt? You must've been so scared!

303
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,130
Did it do anything to you?

304
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,850
{\an8}Mom, I gand bweedh! 

305
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,310
Your adventuring is getting out of hand, you know that?

306
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,440
I went a bit far this time.

307
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,360
Too far! You nearly left this world!

308
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,570
I think that took three years off your sister's life.

309
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,290
I'm sorry.

310
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,730
Anyway, he went crazy out there, right?

311
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,400
So he really is the wild type?

312
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,770
Kennosuke's a super samurai!

313
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,920
He saved my life!

314
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,040
Yeah...

315
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,460
I guess he's not all that bad.

316
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,980
Your face looks to have lost all traces of hostility.

317
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,070
But I have also lost my purpose.

318
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,810
Why do I still live?

319
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,620
I have no lord to serve, nobody to protect...

320
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,030
All I have is the regret that I didn't die when I ought to have.

321
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,370
Purpose isn't something you seek.

322
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,810
It's something you find within yourself.

323
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,430
Spare me your preaching.

324
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,280
Well, I am a monk.

325
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,180
Why don't you try believing in and living with us?

326
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,950
I'm empty.

327
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,370
I have nothing to offer.

328
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,670
All that's left for me is to rot away.

329
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,740
Looks like your tummy's empty too.

330
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,220
Come with me.

331
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,900
And eat some food first.

332
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,150
You can rack your brain after that.

333
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,820
I'm back.

334
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,030
Welcome home!

335
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,160
What were you up to, Unc—

336
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,550
Kennosuke!

337
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,540
Thank you for having me.

338
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,290
You've gotta be kidding me.

339
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,410
This thorny enemy mech is Cactus.

340
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:38,980
Someone in the UN randomly picked that name 'cause they needed to call it something.

341
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,150
Immorality creaks in the dark

342
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,710
Blurring the advantages of evolution

343
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,260
Sorrow remains silent

344
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,160
Simply praying for the safety of the soul

345
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm always just barely behind the times

346
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,260
Surrounded by thick gray clouds

347
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,850
Acid rain pours down on me

348
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,430
Melting away my morals tonight

349
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,650
Everyone's assigned an alphabet

350
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,290
Everyone's called by their code

351
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,750
Acting with no sense of reason

352
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,940
For whom are these battles fought

353
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:46,960
The scar that remains in the corner of my memories

354
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,480
sheds light to the end

355
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,040
A voice in the distance whispered gently

356
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,420
A new age is coming

357
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,860
Love transcends time

358
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,370
Dreams go the distance

359
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,250
Voices will reach to the ends of the earth

360
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,770
No matter how weak the light

361
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,270
I have the ultimate strength to believe

362
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,070
This is the strength of our bond

363
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,950
Love will transcend time

364
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,320
Everyone's lonely and a stranger to others

365
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,150
The names we are given

366
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:11,220
Can be easily taken away

367
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,560
The mirror shows our weaknesses

368
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,550
We can't look away from it

369
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:27,270
It is our feelings that make our hearts scream out in pain

370
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,010
Don't stop

371
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,320
Even if I have to take on the pain of others

372
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,350
I will change the world one step at a time

373
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,560
Acting on emotions won't help us understand each other

374
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,150
But I won't stop believing in my reality

375
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,410
I want to keep on living

376
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,960
Because ever since I met you

377
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,290
Something's taken root deep within my heart

378
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,670
And it is starting to bloom

379
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,970
The Castle Ruins Cannot Turn Back Time

380
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,970
{\an7\fs30}Cactus: 3.8m tall
Unmanned geoframe that the enemy deploys en masse.
It boasts of high-frequency blades in its arms for weapons but has no inherent gravity or inertia control mechanism.
Appears all over the place and seems to be abducting humans.

381
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,980
The Foreign Taste Tells All

382
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,850
Sign: Demons? Bears? Mysterious Creatures

383
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,620
{\an7}Top: Koharu
 Bottom: Yukina
