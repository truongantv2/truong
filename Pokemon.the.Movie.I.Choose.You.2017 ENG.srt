1
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,811
Yes, this battle of the
Pokemon league finals is

2
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,646
really picking up steam!

3
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,485
Gengar dodges it!

4
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,451
It's night shade!

5
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,455
But Blastoise withstands it!

6
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,416
Wait! That was an ice beam!

7
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:46,546
And gengar is frozen!
What will the trainer do now?

8
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,472
There goes the poke ball...

9
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,893
And the next Pokémon up is...
Venusaur!

10
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,978
It's a razor leaf!

11
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,486
But Blastoise's hydro pump
scores a direct hit!

12
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,749
Wow! Venusaur's solar beam,
and Blastoise's hydro pump...

13
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,500
What power!

14
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,252
Man! Oh, wow! Yes!
Yeah! Get 'em!

15
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,922
This is Ash Ketchum,
from pallet town.

16
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,924
Ash is almost ten years old.

17
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:34,761
When youngsters with aspirations
to become Pokémon trainers turn ten,

18
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,139
they can choose their first
Pokemon from professor oak.

19
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,308
They can choose
from Bulbasaur...

20
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,853
Charmander... And Squirtle.
Then, they can begin

21
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,523
their exciting journeys
as Pokemon trainers!

22
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:56,324
Bulbasaur... charmander...

23
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,950
Squirtle... Here we go.

24
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,876
All right, I choose you!

25
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,181
Ash ketchum,
are you still asleep?

26
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,934
You'll be late getting
to professor oak's lab!

27
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,979
Yeah, right,
professor oak's lab...

28
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,860
Mom, why didn't you wake me up?!

29
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,695
You said yourself
when you turned ten,

30
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,364
you could wake up on your own!

31
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,796
Hey professor oak!
I made it. I'm here!

32
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,297
Oh. Hello, ash.

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,926
So, professor oak,
where's my Pokémon?!

34
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,679
Ah, so you're the last of
the four young ones

35
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,431
starting out
on their journeys today.

36
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:06,352
I've thought about it a lot and
it took me a really long time,

37
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,897
but I finally decided.
I'm gonna choose squirtle!

38
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,942
I'm afraid squirtle was chosen
by a trainer who wasn't late.

39
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,448
I've got no one
to blame but myself.

40
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,616
Okay, then
I'll choose Bulbasaur!

41
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:24,120
Bulbasaur went with a trainer
who also got here on time.

42
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:30,251
All right! I mean
I really want charmander!

43
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,004
Being a second late for
a train, or even a Pokemon,

44
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,547
can be life changing.

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,140
Does that mean... I go on
my journey without a Pokémon?

46
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,392
Well, there is another, but...

47
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,769
Uh, I'll take it!

48
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,647
I think I should warn you
that there is a problem

49
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,815
with this last one...

50
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,568
So what? Since I was late, then
I've got a problem with me, too!

51
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,820
All right...

52
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,575
Awesome! All right then,
you're my Pokemon!

53
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,245
Whoa!

54
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,971
This Pokémon is called Pikachu.

55
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,349
It's so cute!
Looks like I got the best one!

56
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,350
You'll see...

57
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,395
Oh, yeah! Hi, Pikachu,
my name's Ash Ketchum!

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,647
You and I are gonna
be best friends!

59
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,779
It's the electric mouse Pokemon.

60
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,032
Pikachu can be rather shy,

61
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,826
but quite electrifying
when touched by humans.

62
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,872
Hey, I can take a little zap!

63
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,373
All right then.

64
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,793
If that's how you feel, then
this is Pikachu's poke ball.

65
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,463
Thanks a lot, professor!

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,881
Ash?

67
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,176
Remember, you were going to
head out on your journey

68
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,678
right after getting your Pokémon.
For goodness sake!

69
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,728
Here. I packed shirts,
underwear, a towel,

70
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,731
your toothbrush,
and a sleeping bag.

71
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,774
Let's go, Pikachu!

72
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,404
Don't Pokémon usually
go in their poké balls?

73
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,991
They sure do!
Come on, Pikachu, get in!

74
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,745
Get in your poké ball!

75
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,208
Oh, right.

76
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,420
This Pikachu hates getting
into any sort of poké ball.

77
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,213
Whoa, it does?

78
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,591
Now get in!

79
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,227
Wow! If you're playing catch,

80
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,228
then you're good friends already!

81
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:58,524
Yeah, you're right!
We're best friends already, right?

82
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,083
Pikachu? Are you gonna be
like this the whole way?

83
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,755
Is it because you don't like me?

84
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,966
Well, I like you a lot!

85
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,803
And no matter what,
I want to be your friend.

86
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,140
So we're all done with this.

87
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,643
Now. Put 'er there

88
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,481
you're a handful.

89
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,321
Hey, a Pidgey!
That's awesome! Yes!

90
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,615
Catching that Pidgey's gonna
be my first step

91
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,492
toward becoming
a Pokémon master!

92
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,993
Go, poké ball!

93
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,373
I caught it!

94
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:07,260
The way to catch 'em is
have a battle. Go, Pikachu!

95
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,845
Aw, come on,
aren't you gonna help me out?

96
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,849
Fine then. I'll do it myself.

97
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,025
It's a Spearow!

98
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,554
Let's get out of here, quick!

99
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,651
Knock it off!

100
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,821
I'm the one who threw the rock!
You should be attacking me!

101
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,770
Are you all right, Pikachu?

102
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:56,327
Pikachu! You're gonna be just fine!
Hang in there!

103
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,139
Pikachu!

104
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,561
No, Pikachu.

105
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,314
This can't be happening, right?

106
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,160
Pikachu! You've gotta go inside!

107
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,914
I know you can't stand going inside
your poké ball, but still...

108
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,167
In there, you'll be protected!

109
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,836
So come on...
Get inside, please?

110
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,506
Then leave the rest to me.
I'll take care of this!

111
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,221
All right, you!

112
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,557
I don't think you know who
you're dealing with!

113
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,643
But I'm Ash Ketchum,
from pallet town!

114
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,021
And I'm gonna be
the world's greatest Pokemon master!

115
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,273
Mess with me and
you're gonna lose!

116
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,817
I'm gonna catch all of
you Pokémon at once!

117
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,531
Pikachu, you've gotta get
inside your poké ball now!

118
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,242
All right, you,
hit me with your best shot!

119
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,332
Pikachu...

120
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,174
You'll stay?

121
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,842
Mean it?

122
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,953
What's that?

123
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,079
Pikachu? Someday we'll both
meet that Pokemon!

124
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,989
Pikachu, use quick attack!

125
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,950
Tangela, vine whip!

126
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,005
Tangela is unable to battle!

127
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,925
Thus, the winner is
ash from pallet town!

128
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,926
All right!

129
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,679
Man, you were awesome, Pikachu!

130
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,934
Very well. As proof of your victory
at the Celadon gym,

131
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,813
and by the authority of
the Pokemon league,

132
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,357
I now present you with
the rainbow badge.

133
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,026
I just got a rainbow badge!

134
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,363
How many badges does this make?

135
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,864
It's my third one!

136
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,367
I look forward to you
winning all eight

137
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,244
and entering the Pokemon league!

138
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,037
Thanks! I'll do my best!

139
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,216
Oh, hi, mom.

140
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,552
Well, well!
You finally decided to call!

141
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,054
Uh, yeah.

142
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,891
Do you have any idea how many
Pokémon centers

143
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,477
I've been leaving messages at
hoping you would be there?!

144
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,313
So what's this big emergency?

145
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,190
If I didn't say it
was a big emergency,

146
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,234
you wouldn't have called back,
would you?!

147
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,568
You're just like your father!

148
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,488
It wouldn't hurt to call me
once in a while, now would it?

149
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,074
Oh! Pikachu! Hi there!

150
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,494
That's all? I'm hanging up.

151
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,912
Now you just hold on!

152
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,998
I want to make sure
you're eating right!

153
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,082
I'm eating...

154
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,751
And eat your vegetables!
It's very important!

155
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,252
And what about laundry?

156
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,922
You're not wearing dirty
shirts every day, are you?

157
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,341
Come on, mom!
You worry too much.

158
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,930
You're all set.
Your Pokemon's completely healed.

159
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,849
Happy and in perfect health.

160
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,935
I was so worried!
Thank you, nurse joy.

161
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,604
Wanted posters?

162
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,981
Yes, that's team rocket.

163
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,275
Team rocket?

164
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,693
They're awful,

165
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,195
and they go around stealing
other people's Pokemon.

166
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,447
The worst of the worst.

167
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,532
Really? I wonder what
that's all about...

168
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,784
She's wondering what
we're all about.

169
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,162
Actions speak louder than words.

170
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,665
All we do is get our paws
on Primo Pokémon,

171
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,793
and they'll know how
magnificently we rock!

172
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:31,755
Excuse me! Nurse joy!
Please help my Pokemon!

173
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,802
My Vaporeon's been hurt...

174
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,763
Let me see.
It doesn't look good!

175
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,349
What happened?

176
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,309
That Entei
came out of nowhere...

177
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,061
En '7
tel. I'm sorry. Mom!

178
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,271
Gotta go!
Ash! But...

179
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,982
I thought for sure
we could catch it...

180
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,402
Don't worry. It'll be just fine.

181
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,573
Thank you so much!

182
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,826
Did you say Entei?

183
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,162
Yeah. One of
the legendary Pokemon.

184
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,332
They're so rare,
nobody ever sees them!

185
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:07,252
I tried to catch it, but it was
so overwhelmingly strong...

186
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,255
We were beat in no time,

187
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,341
and after, that it ran
into the forest.

188
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,092
It's probably still close!

189
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:15,636
I'm gonna catch it!

190
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,556
Let's go, Pikachu!

191
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,519
Some big deal!
And they're totally clueless.

192
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,148
I know you!

193
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:32,649
Entei's on the run!
Ain't we got fun?!

194
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,200
Where are you, Entei?

195
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,754
There it is!

196
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,889
Let's go, Piplup!

197
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,853
Hold it! I got here first!

198
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,562
I got here first!

199
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,572
Piplup, use bubble beam!

200
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,379
Pikachu, use thunderbolt!

201
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,321
Lucario, aura sphere!

202
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,709
Piplup, bubble beam!

203
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,312
All right! You let it escape!

204
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,899
I totally could've caught it
if you hadn't gotten in the way!

205
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,193
You were in the way!

206
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,652
No, you were!

207
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,112
Wanna see if you can beat me?

208
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,991
Good idea. I'm ash from pallet town!
Let's have a battle...

209
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,621
And I accept! I'm verity
and I'm from Twinleaf town!

210
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,750
Hey, dude! Once I Polish off this kid,
you're gonna be next!

211
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,044
I want a battle with you, too!

212
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,172
Hey! What do you mean,
Polish me off?!

213
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,510
I'm sorrel from Veilstone city.
I'll take a pass on the battles.

214
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:02,595
Running away?

215
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,179
Come on! Let's have a battle!

216
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,098
Here's a little warning for you.

217
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,058
You're going to feel
the wind soon.

218
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,060
I'd start looking for
shelter from the rain.

219
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,188
It's gonna rain?

220
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:16,608
Before you find shelter, I think
you'd better call your mommy!

221
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,486
Hey! Quit it! Let's do this!

222
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,029
Right with you!

223
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,989
I'll give you the first move!

224
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,866
Quit trying to be a gentleman.

225
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,576
You may wind up regretting it!

226
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,870
Now, Piplup, use drill peck!

227
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,416
All right, Pikachu,
use iron tail!

228
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,837
Now, quick attack!

229
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,719
Piplup, are you okay?

230
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,305
Then use hydro pump!

231
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,099
Dodge it...

232
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,698
My Piplup!

233
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,991
Here! Let's move!

234
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:06,908
Right...

235
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,793
Well, I'm here,
so where's Entei?

236
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,087
What's that?

237
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,923
Entei's coming to check us out!

238
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,181
We're blasting off again!

239
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,953
That rock!
Let's get on top of it!

240
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,135
Onix! Stop it! You're only
gonna hurt yourself this way!

241
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,971
Yelling at it is only
going to make it worse!

242
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:11,806
All right!

243
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,941
Ash! Be careful!

244
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,610
Stop it!

245
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,154
Use whirlpool!

246
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,327
I'm sorry for scaring you, onix!

247
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,621
I wish you'd just
calm down, please!

248
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,980
Onix, I'm sorry!

249
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,318
Piplup, your whirlpool
really saved the day!

250
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,196
Ash, thank you.
I've gotta tell you.

251
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,492
You do some dumb things,
but I'm impressed.

252
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:12,867
Forget it.

253
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,369
Rain!

254
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,704
Just like that kid said!

255
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,307
A charmander!

256
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,435
It doesn't look
like it's very happy...

257
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,771
Hey what are you doing out
in the rain like this?

258
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,409
That must be its trainer.

259
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:05,128
You're still here? Go away!

260
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,298
Hey wait, are you its trainer?

261
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,716
Who's asking?

262
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,593
Answer the question!

263
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,929
What're you worked up about?

264
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,306
Yeah. Originally I was.

265
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,307
Originally?

266
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,517
I ditched the weakling.

267
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,436
There are charmander like
that one all over the place.

268
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:26,775
But then, it just kept following me.
So I told it to wait here.

269
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,318
What an awful thing to say!

270
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,361
Ash is right!

271
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,738
When you've caught a Pokémon
and then you tell it to wait,

272
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,948
some of them will
actually wait forever!

273
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,867
So what's the problem?

274
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,787
Hold it!

275
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,754
Only a Pokémon's
strength matters.

276
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,424
If it's gonna survive,
it had better grow stronger!

277
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:51,716
What?!

278
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,137
Wait! Isn't it a trainer's job to help
their Pokemon grow strong?!

279
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,014
Nah. And what do you get
for that work anyway?

280
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,310
You get to become friends!

281
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:03,978
You're too soft.

282
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,981
The only thing friendship
does is make a Pokemon weak!

283
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,609
My name's cross.

284
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:12,070
I'm going to become
the greatest trainer ever.

285
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,156
Hey! Hold it!

286
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:20,495
Charmander!

287
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,456
Its flame is getting weaker!

288
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,999
And if Charmander's flame
goes out then...

289
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,337
Ash, we've got to do something!

290
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,421
Right!

291
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,742
You left it out in the rain!
What were you thinking?!

292
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,703
Calm down.
It isn't ash's fault!

293
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,540
It was in the rain after
its trainer abandoned it!

294
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,833
It would've stayed out
in the rain forever!

295
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,548
Can you help?

296
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,175
That's what I'm trying to do.

297
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,388
No Pokémon with that
much loyalty is going

298
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,764
to go untreated!

299
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,943
I know it's hard,
but please take this.

300
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,906
That should stabilize you.

301
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,825
Now all we do is wait
for it to recover.

302
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,076
Make sure it doesn't get cold.

303
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,579
I'll warm it up!

304
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,376
Don't worry, charmander.
You'll be fine!

305
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,517
How do you feel?
Are you still cold?

306
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,942
Things are looking a lot better.

307
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,319
'Cuz of you. Thanks a lot!

308
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,280
You're like nurse joy
at the Pokemon center!

309
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,574
I'm hoping to become
a Pokémon professor,

310
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,201
and you need medical
training for that.

311
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,202
Wow...

312
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,663
Right now,
I'm traveling all over,

313
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,623
gathering data
on legendary Pokemon.

314
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,835
So it's good that you ran
into Entei, isn't it?

315
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,255
Of course. It was
a priceless experience.

316
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,300
By the way, why did
you come here, verity?

317
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,968
You're a long way from home.

318
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,720
Well... long story.
Hey, ash, why are you here?

319
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,894
Who, me? I wanna be the world's
greatest Pokemon master!

320
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,772
Master? Do you mean
the world's best trainer?

321
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,024
Oh, no way!
Much more than that!

322
00:28:58,612 --> 00:28:59,821
It's so cold!

323
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,576
Are you all right?

324
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,577
Sure! That was nothing!

325
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,916
Trying to warm me up?

326
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,172
Thanks, Piplup...

327
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,633
As a precaution, you're going back
in your poké ball.

328
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,178
We shouldn't let the Pokemon
spend the night out in the cold.

329
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,847
You're right. You, too, Piplup.

330
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,768
You know...
I'd like to do that.

331
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,854
But Pikachu really can't stand
getting into its poké ball.

332
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,105
Right, buddy?

333
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,485
No, you can't!
You'll catch a cold!

334
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,946
It's for the best.

335
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:42,947
Lucario...

336
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,366
Alright, Piplup...

337
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,989
Seeing the fearsome
forces of nature...

338
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,783
People and Pokemon are the same.

339
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,160
Yeah...

340
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,290
There's a legend, that proclaims
ho-oh gave life to Entei.

341
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,542
You mean it?!

342
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,342
You see, around
a hundred and fifty years ago,

343
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,344
there was
a magnificent bell tower.

344
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:49,139
And this bell tower
made it possible for humans

345
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,433
to actually make
contact with ho-oh.

346
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:55,520
But lightning struck the tower,
engulfing it in flames.

347
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,690
Suddenly, a great rain came down,

348
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,150
and the flames
were extinguished.

349
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:04,403
But three nameless Pokemon
succumbed to the inferno.

350
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,365
Amidst the destruction,
ho-oh descended and bestowed

351
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,243
life upon them once again,
and they were revived.

352
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,996
They represented
the lightning that struck,

353
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,790
the flame that engulfed,

354
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,000
and the water that
extinguished the tower.

355
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,713
Three natural forces made flesh.

356
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:29,637
Raikou, Entei... And Suicune.

357
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,597
Oh, I just love Suicune!

358
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,310
And this, is the Pokémon who guards
over their existences...

359
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,020
Ho-oh.

360
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,647
You've seen it?

361
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,650
The first day I started out
on my journey!

362
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,192
Are you serious?

363
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,821
Yeah! And as soon as I did...
This came floating down!

364
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,449
No way you got the rainbow wing!

365
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,952
What's the rainbow wing?

366
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:56,122
Few people have ever
even seen ho-oh,

367
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,167
and on rare occasions,
ho-oh is said to bestow a feather

368
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,169
on a human
it particularly likes.

369
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,839
Yeah? I guess that must
mean ho-oh likes me! Huh!

370
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,384
But, why would ho-oh do that?

371
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,511
There's a legend
that explains it.

372
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,513
It says there is
a rainbow hero who is led

373
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,891
by the rainbow wing
to seek out ho-oh.

374
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,185
A rainbow hero?

375
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,813
I don't know about any of this,
but it's cool...

376
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:23,191
Oh. Impressed with yourself, huh?

377
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,693
Oops!

378
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,145
Morning, Piplup. Sleep well?

379
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,401
Entei and its friends are gone...

380
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:07,360
Yeah.

381
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,865
Hey! Charmander!
You feeling better?

382
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,960
Let's see.
Your tail flame looks good.

383
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:25,879
Yup.

384
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,924
That tells me
you are back to feeling fine!

385
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:29,757
You're good to go.

386
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,092
Isn't that great, charmander?

387
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:33,928
Hey...

388
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:36,348
You wanna come along with us?

389
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,517
I'd like us to
become good friends!

390
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:48,610
Please?

391
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,699
Great! You really mean it?

392
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,371
Okay, here it goes.

393
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,005
I just caught a charmander!

394
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,092
Congratulations, ash.
You too, Pikachu.

395
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,560
It's a rainbow!

396
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,729
So beautiful!

397
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,606
They say that ho-oh lives
at the end of the rainbow.

398
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:41,830
The legend... Says the rainbow wing
will guide you.

399
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,626
So, what's over that way?

400
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,838
There are quite a number of
steep mountains over there.

401
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,840
The Raizen mountain range.

402
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,054
I know!

403
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,016
I'm gonna meet ho-oh
and have a Pokémon battle!

404
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,188
I'd love to meet ho-oh, too!

405
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,230
So would I!

406
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,899
Then I can determine for myself

407
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:13,236
whether the legend of
the rainbow hero, is actually true.

408
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,404
C'mon!

409
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,032
We've gotta get moving
and find ho-oh!

410
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,534
Right!

411
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,288
That's music to my ears...

412
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,456
Entei proved too elusive, but...

413
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,041
Catching ho-oh would rule!

414
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,085
We're so cool...

415
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,379
Yee-haaa!

416
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,757
Hah!

417
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,228
A bug type against a bug type!

418
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,064
Yeah! Caterpie, I choose you!

419
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,363
Caterpie, use string shot!

420
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,581
All right!

421
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,583
It's evolving...

422
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,589
It turned into a metapod!

423
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,718
Pinsir's getting away.

424
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,764
That's okay!
This is what counts.

425
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,933
Congratulations, metapod!

426
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,292
Really? Suicune?!

427
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,295
Standing right in front of me.

428
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,505
Man, I wish
I could've been there...

429
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,008
Our eyes met...

430
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,344
And it was like time stopped.

431
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,305
Yeah. We were so connected.

432
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,516
Wow. Must've been nice!

433
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,187
To meet suicune so soon after
seeing entei. Incredible luck.

434
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,982
I think so, too!

435
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,526
I wonder how
my mom would feel about it.

436
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:04,240
Oh. My mother... she's a famous
Pokemon trainer back home.

437
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,867
Nothing I ever do
is good enough for her.

438
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,162
If I'm honest, we haven't
talked since I left.

439
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:13,875
You know what I think?

440
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,293
I think she would
be proud of you.

441
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,211
He's right!
'Course she would.

442
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,507
Maybe...

443
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,552
Jigglypuff, double slap, go!

444
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,557
Charmander, use flamethrower!

445
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,405
Jigglypuff is unable to battle!
Ash is the winner!

446
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,365
Great work, charmander!

447
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,755
You evolved into Charmeleon!
That's awesome!

448
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,261
Nice to meet you! I'm verity.

449
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,138
I'm sorrel.

450
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,766
I hope ash hasn't been
causing you too much trouble.

451
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:16,437
Oh, well! He's rambunctious,
but he's got a big heart.

452
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,105
I hope you'll all
be good friends!

453
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,566
Mom, I wish
you'd stop worrying...

454
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,621
Sorrel? You find anything?

455
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,417
Yes, this is an excellent book.
So well researched.

456
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,001
Listen!

457
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,378
From high above,

458
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:44,549
ho-oh watched over the many works
of people and of Pokemon,

459
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,884
and they experienced
the aura of happiness.

460
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,677
And they received
energy from it.

461
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,975
And yet, the heart of evil
stole strength from it.

462
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:58,604
What's that?

463
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,275
When the rainbow wing
touches the heart of evil,

464
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,651
its color vanishes.

465
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,778
The heart of evil?

466
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,656
Its color vanishes?

467
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,326
Looks like mine's just fine.

468
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,871
Like your mom said, you may
be a little rambunctious,

469
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,248
but you sure don't
have an evil heart.

470
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,877
That's right! 'Cause I'm big-hearted
and rambunctious!

471
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:24,380
Knock it off!

472
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,132
That's not nice! Quit laughing!

473
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,516
Pikachu, use iron tail!

474
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,858
Pikachu, use thunderbolt!

475
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:57,538
Snorlax is unable to battle!
Ash is the winner!

476
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:00,583
All right!

477
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,876
Very nice!

478
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,421
So, since ash was victorious,
who is his next challenger?

479
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,547
What do you say, Piplup?

480
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,173
Lam!

481
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,056
It's cross!

482
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,226
So he's the trainer
you were talking about...

483
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,645
I heard a rumor,

484
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,314
you started working with
that useless charmander.

485
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,067
There's no such thing
as a useless Pokemon!

486
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,194
Charmeleon, let's go!

487
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,325
It actually evolved?
It doesn't matter.

488
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,662
A weakling is still a weakling!

489
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,454
You're not even close!

490
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,500
When a Pokémon works with
a trainer, it gets stronger!

491
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:48,627
All right, my strong fire-type
Pokémon, Incineroar, to arms!

492
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,097
Look at that...

493
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:57,640
An Incineroar.

494
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,601
Now come at me!

495
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,353
Charmeleon, use flamethrower!

496
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,568
That's it!

497
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:13,906
Use slash!

498
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,456
Yes!

499
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,502
That's odd...

500
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:31,174
Keep it up, charmeleon!
Seismic toss, now!

501
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,319
Incineroar? Let's do it.

502
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,032
Charmeleon, use flamethrower!

503
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,660
And we'll use flamethrower, too!

504
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,837
Charmeleon!

505
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,258
Of course.

506
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,678
When Incineroar takes
enough damage,

507
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,346
it gains more power.

508
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,390
But that means...

509
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,476
It took the attacks on purpose.

510
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,604
Charmeleon, use flamethrower!

511
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,191
It can't keep up!

512
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,527
Its newly-evolved
powers aren't ready!

513
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,363
Ash shouldn't be relying
on strength alone...

514
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,032
Use fire fangs!

515
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,498
Use throat chop!

516
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,642
Let's wrap it up.
Use cross chop!

517
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,896
We're not gonna lose this!
Use flamethrower!

518
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,398
No, ash, you can't!

519
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,582
Charmeleon!

520
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:35,590
Charmeleon is unable to battle!
The winner is Incineroar!

521
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,220
You're too soft!

522
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,222
You battled using cheap friendship,

523
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:47,726
and called moves your Pokémon
couldn't use, so you lost.

524
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,687
You're the worst trainer
I've ever seen and...

525
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,481
You'll never win!

526
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,949
Your Pokemon are
fully recovered and healthy.

527
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,451
Thanks very much.

528
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,412
Cheer up, Charmeleon's fine!

529
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:19,050
That guy...
His training is totally wrong!

530
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,468
I know I should have
won that thing, but...

531
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,807
Try as you might, you cannot
deny his convictions.

532
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,893
He and Incineroar
are bonded together

533
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,312
through their shared belief
in pure, raw strength.

534
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,482
Even so, it's wrong for
a guy like that to win!

535
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:38,736
Your first step needs to
be accepting that you lost.

536
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:40,988
Can't you channel
the frustration of losing,

537
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,824
into working hard,
so that you'll win next time?

538
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,951
Yeah, I hear you.

539
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,829
You know?

540
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,959
Pikachu would've won that thing.

541
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,585
Ash, you shouldn't say that!

542
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,504
What if charmeleon
had heard you?!

543
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,802
If winning's all
you care about...

544
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,345
Then you're no
different from cross.

545
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:10,851
Ash, wait!
Hold on!

546
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,519
Ash, come back!

547
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,364
What's with those two
thinking they're so smart?

548
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,619
Hey, I'm right,
don't you think?!

549
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,288
So you're saying
it's my fault, huh?!

550
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,294
Even Pikachu... man...

551
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:51,517
If only my first Pokémon had
been a squirtle or a Bulbasaur.

552
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,184
Pikachu...

553
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:47,280
Ho-oh, I thought
I was the rainbow hero.

554
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,869
Who needs Pikachu anyway?

555
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,122
I'm just fine... all by myself!

556
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,608
Ash ketchum,
are you still asleep?

557
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,027
You'll be late getting
to professor oak's class!

558
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,070
Yeah, right...

559
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,407
Mom, why didn't you wake me up?!

560
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,544
Professor oak!

561
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,921
Oh, if it isn't ash...

562
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,380
Am I on time?

563
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,008
There are four students
who came to school late,

564
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,843
and you were
the latest of them all.

565
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,973
Ash, you're late!

566
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,184
I overslept a little.

567
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,519
Where's your homework?

568
00:48:58,561 --> 00:48:59,687
Aw, I forgot it!

569
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,146
What were you thinking?!

570
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,821
Ash, what is it?

571
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,781
Uh... it's nothing.

572
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,241
You're weird.

573
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:16,245
The subject of today's class
is rainbows.

574
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:20,541
Rainbows are caused by the sun's rays
moving through the atmosphere,

575
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,377
and when they encounter water vapor,

576
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:27,047
their light is bent and refracted,
causing a multicolored arc.

577
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,132
Children, have you ever...

578
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,852
How long are you
going to stand there?

579
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,856
Aren't you sick
of that view yet?

580
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,274
What's on your mind?

581
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,403
I was just wondering
what's way out there.

582
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:51,947
Let's see.

583
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:55,409
There are forests and rivers,
and mountains...

584
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,577
And there's the next town, too.

585
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,704
And past that?

586
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:03,333
More forests and rivers... And
eventually, you get to the sea.

587
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,043
And past that?

588
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,462
I'm sure it's more of the same.

589
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:09,423
The thing is...

590
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,593
You never know
until you go there.

591
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,596
For me... I wanna see what's out there
with my own eyes.

592
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:17,889
On a journey?

593
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,016
Sounds like fun.

594
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,685
You don't have to worry
about school and schedules.

595
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,561
You can see lots of
new things in places

596
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,854
you never even knew about.

597
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,941
And at night,
I can look at the stars

598
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,777
and talk things over
with friends I'm traveling with...

599
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:33,906
And as long as my buddy's
with me, I can go anywhere.

600
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:34,948
Your buddy?

601
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:35,991
What buddy?

602
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:37,826
You even have to ask?

603
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,037
My buddy's with me all the time!

604
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,455
Always...

605
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:51,131
Oh, yeah...
Ash...

606
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,216
You're crying.

607
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,218
I am? So?

608
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,802
So pull yourself together!

609
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,970
What's the matter?

610
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,824
Hey, wait!

611
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,506
Of course! We used to run
like this all the time!

612
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,554
But... but... I can't
remember who you are!

613
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,015
You were my very best friend, but...

614
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,565
Do it go!

615
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:03,829
Pikachu!

616
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,347
Pikachu!

617
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,394
Pikachu!
It was all my fault!

618
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:32,565
I'm sorry!
I just... I just...

619
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,576
Look, ash. Here.

620
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:44,912
Thank you very much.

621
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:47,289
Do you know how long
we've been looking for you?!

622
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,667
Uh... Sorry.

623
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,294
Do you honestly think
you're going to win every battle?

624
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:55,422
It's the times we lose
that we truly see

625
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:56,840
what a trainer's made of.

626
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,050
But that's just my opinion.

627
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:08,185
Charmeleon... I'm sorry.

628
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,438
You forgot that
Pokemon even existed?!

629
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,651
That had to have been
the worst dream ever!

630
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,068
But, you know,

631
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:19,404
it's not impossible for
Pokémon to leave us.

632
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,285
When I was young,
my parents were away for work

633
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,244
more than home.

634
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,289
My family had a luxray
who took care of me.

635
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,790
It was always with me.

636
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,626
But then...

637
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,129
There was one awful day
when I went out alone...

638
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,654
Luxray...

639
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:27,802
Luxray! Luxray! Luxray!

640
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,317
After that...

641
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,694
I was afraid to make friends
with Pokémon for a very long time.

642
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,074
The only thing that
snapped me out of it...

643
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,825
Was when I met lucario.

644
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:50,579
Awesome...

645
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,256
What was that?!

646
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:02,549
A Pokémon?

647
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,103
They're Primeape!

648
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,689
Once they're angry,
there's no calming them down!

649
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,035
What's going on?!

650
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:32,412
Ash, we need metapod!

651
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,372
But why?

652
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,333
If we try to fight back,
they'll only get angrier!

653
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:38,710
Got it!

654
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,430
Metapod! Use string shot!

655
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,565
Come on, Primeape,
don't be so mad!

656
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,943
Metapod, you were awesome!

657
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,827
It evolved into a butter-free!

658
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,789
They're after us again!

659
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,167
Butter-free, use sleep powder!

660
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:40,814
Butterfree, you're the best!

661
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,399
Now's our chance!

662
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,865
Well, lookee what
we have here...

663
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,076
A pack of primo Primeape!

664
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,994
And they're all
blissfully asleep.

665
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,080
This is a gotta
catch 'em all moment!

666
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,841
We're blasting off yet again!

667
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:18,851
A river!

668
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,187
We'll take care of this!

669
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,689
Now, it's your turn, Lapras!

670
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,735
Look! That Butterfree's
in trouble!

671
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,571
Right! Butter-free, I choose you!

672
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,628
Butterfree, now use gust, go!

673
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,390
Awesome!

674
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,769
That butter-free has
different coloring.

675
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,103
It's really cute.

676
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,151
I think that
Butterfree's a girl.

677
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:50,985
That's right.

678
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:53,405
Yeah?

679
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:10,839
There!

680
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:14,051
The source of the rainbow.
The Raizen mountains!

681
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:28,481
That's the highest mountain
in the range.

682
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,524
<i>Mount tense“!</i>

683
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,319
You mean that's
where we're going?

684
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,153
That's right.

685
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,364
Then I'll meet ho-oh real soon!

686
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,657
Pikachu. Let's go!

687
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:40,868
Ash!

688
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,663
You hear that?

689
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:44,956
With stereo ears.

690
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,666
We're ho-oh catchers!

691
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,668
Sneaky and snarky!
Sneaky and snarky!

692
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,511
Oh wow, look at
all the butterfree!

693
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,225
All right...
Time for you to come out!

694
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,861
Isn't that the one
butterfree rescued?

695
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:15,695
Sure is!

696
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,490
This is the season when
butter-free gather in groups,

697
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,368
and head south to
their spawning grounds.

698
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:22,786
Whoa...

699
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,788
Look! Your Butterfree's
joining in.

700
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,706
That's their courtship dance.

701
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,714
I'd say they both agree...

702
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,340
Good for you, butterfree!

703
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,552
But, ash, you know if they
both fly off to the south...

704
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,888
That means goodbye
to butterfree.

705
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:52,189
But... That's...
Not what I want to happen.

706
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,526
I mean, Butterfree's
one of my good friends!

707
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,614
I don't want to say goodbye.
No way!

708
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,408
Yeah, I hear you.

709
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,078
It's your decision,
what do you say?

710
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,381
Hi. So what do you
think you wanna do?

711
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:21,261
Do you really wanna go with
the rest of the butter-free...

712
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,845
And say goodbye to all of us?

713
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,248
You should go with your friend!

714
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,961
Hurry up! If you don't go now,
you'll both get left behind!

715
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,632
You're both...
Really great butter-free,

716
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,049
so take care of each other!

717
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,358
You take good care
of yourselves!

718
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,570
Now you two be
careful out there!

719
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:31,456
Butferfree!
Take care of yourself!

720
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:57,440
They're gone...

721
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,649
Yeah...

722
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,279
But you know, I'm really
glad I met butter-free.

723
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:07,534
True, it's not here...
But we'll always be good friends.

724
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,205
One thing's for sure.

725
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:16,584
Trainers raise Pokemon, but
Pokemon live their own lives.

726
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,218
It's raikou!

727
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:54,164
It looks like something's
made the wild Pokémon upset.

728
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,081
It does.

729
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,332
It's ho-oh!

730
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,167
All of them gather here!

731
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:02,213
All of these wild Pokemon want
to receive power from ho-oh.

732
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:09,261
It's faint, but I'm
catching a whiff of ho-oh.

733
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:10,972
Hey, could it be this?

734
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,018
Wow! It's the rainbow wing!

735
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,102
You know of it?

736
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,187
Hey! I know you!

737
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,439
You wrote the book!
What was your name?

738
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,942
Why don't you just
call me Bonji?

739
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,821
For the past twenty years,
I've been on a quest,

740
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:29,490
searching for ho-oh as
part of my research.

741
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,783
Twenty years?

742
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,661
You see, I've pulled
data from many places,

743
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:36,873
which led me to this mountain
for ho-oh's next appearance.

744
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,541
Then let's all go together!

745
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,294
Yeah we're on our way
to see ho-oh as well.

746
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:47,466
All right. That shine is
the shine of youth.

747
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,635
How I missed it.

748
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:53,389
It's almost too beautiful
for me to look upon.

749
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:57,727
It's probably thanks in large part
to the rainbow wing...

750
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:01,189
That you were able to come across
entei, suicune, and raikou.

751
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:05,818
Ho-oh wants to know if there
is a young person out there

752
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,653
suited to be the rainbow hero.

753
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:08,905
You mean me?

754
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,990
That means you may
have someone guiding you.

755
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:14,577
A guide from the shadows.
Have you noticed anything?

756
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:18,497
From the shadows?
Wait, yeah there was something...

757
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:20,708
I wonder if it's still there...

758
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:25,588
I suspect it's an extremely
rare Pokemon. Marshadow.

759
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,339
Marshadow?

760
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:29,634
Yes. They say it's a guide
from the shadows.

761
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,760
When a color of
the rainbow fades,

762
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:34,639
marshadow seals it back up
and makes it right.

763
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:38,101
There's the summit...

764
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,644
The rainbow wing!

765
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,706
When a rainbow flower
blooms upon rainbow rock,

766
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,582
ho-oh shall appear.

767
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,793
Well, I can't just
stand here waiting!

768
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,169
Let's go, buddy!

769
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:08,005
Hey, wait for me!

770
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:13,219
Time flies, and rainbows
quickly vanish.

771
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,638
Yes, young ones. Hurry!

772
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,977
The "young ones" have to hurry!

773
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,355
I'm not feeling
all that young...

774
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,898
Hurrying's for the harried...

775
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,819
And all on an empty stomach.
And all on an empty stomach.

776
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,456
That's where you should
place the rainbow wing.

777
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:45,585
I'll do it!

778
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,306
It's cross! What's going on?!

779
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,016
I'll take that!

780
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,352
The trainer who battles ho-oh
is the strongest,

781
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,853
and that trainer is me!

782
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:06,105
That's not how it works!

783
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:09,776
Now look! The one who gets to
battle ho-oh is the chosen one!

784
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:10,902
The rainbow hero!

785
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:12,236
You're too soft.

786
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,905
Remember might makes right.
And that's it.

787
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,658
So, what about the weak then?

788
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:17,616
They're trash!

789
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:18,951
And people who lose?

790
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,119
Worse than trash!

791
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,831
There's no way I can
afford to let you win this!

792
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,174
You're marshadow!

793
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,011
That's the Pokémon
we saw that night!

794
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,804
Marshadow is so cute...

795
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:41,306
That's the guide
from the shadows? Wow.

796
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:49,648
Marshadow... Its only purpose
is to observe the proceedings.

797
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:50,524
<i>Bony?</i>

798
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,155
Charmeleon! I choose you!

799
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,745
Use flamethrower!

800
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:05,915
Charge, charmeleon!

801
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,294
Charmeleon, now use slash!

802
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,341
Perfect!

803
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:18,678
Throat chop, go!

804
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:27,937
Use slash again!

805
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:34,694
Use flamethrower!

806
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:37,530
Charmeleon!

807
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,596
You evolved into a Charizard!

808
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,182
Go Charizard!

809
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:06,434
Aw, who cares?

810
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,228
Even when weak Pokemon evolve,
they're still weak!

811
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,687
Now use throat chop!

812
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,815
Charizard, use slash!

813
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:21,699
Use flamethrower!

814
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:30,624
Now use dragon rage!

815
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:44,221
Charizard! We've gotta
wrap this up quick!

816
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:45,765
Build up your power.

817
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:47,683
Let's end this one
with a big attack!

818
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,519
All right, fire fang!

819
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:54,773
Dodge it, quick!

820
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:01,864
Grab and drag it down!

821
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:06,577
Use seismic toss!

822
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,884
Incineroar, use flamethrower!

823
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,805
Charizard, use flamethrower!

824
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,771
Go!

825
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:59,463
Alright!
You did it, Charizard!

826
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:22,653
Ho-oh...
I saw ho-oh, too!

827
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:27,199
But it didn't gift me
with the rainbow wing!

828
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:29,243
And here
I did everything I could

829
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:31,537
to become
the strongest trainer of all!

830
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:34,707
Why must it be you?!

831
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,084
If ho-oh doesn't consider
me the strongest,

832
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:38,502
I'll just crush ho-oh!

833
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:39,628
But, cross...

834
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:42,215
I wanna get stronger, too, you know.

835
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,885
But still, I only got this far
with the help of my friends!

836
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,261
So I know it's not
only about strength!

837
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:50,389
Then what do you
even battle for?!

838
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:51,974
I do it...

839
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,560
Because I wanna make friends!

840
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,604
Not just with ho-oh!

841
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,565
I wanna make friends with
all kinds of Pokémon!

842
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:01,943
That's why I battle!

843
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:13,954
Not good!

844
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:21,504
Now come to me, ho-oh!

845
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:42,107
You see, the rainbow wing...

846
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:46,278
Loses its color when touched
by one with an evil heart.

847
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:53,995
What?!

848
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,796
Marshadow seals it back up,
and makes it right.

849
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:10,803
I'll pound you down, too!
Lycanroc, use crush claw!

850
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:24,608
Oh no!

851
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,818
Marshadow's
controlling lycanroc!

852
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:29,780
It wants to tear people
and Pokémon apart!

853
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,541
You just...

854
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,084
Don't you see?!

855
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:45,463
That means it never forgot
you were once its trainer!

856
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,174
That's just like Charizard
to be awesome!

857
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:10,946
Lucaflo!

858
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,033
Pikachu! Use thunderbolt!

859
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:25,461
It looks like marshadow wants
to control all of you as well!

860
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:26,712
No way!

861
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:29,215
Ho-oh will never appear
now that it's come to this!

862
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:39,891
Is everyone all right?

863
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,560
Yeah... I think so...

864
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:48,275
Young man, you have got to
get the rainbow wing back.

865
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:53,280
Marshadow is getting its
power from the rainbow wing!

866
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:56,783
And there's only person who
can get it back.

867
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,326
That is you!

868
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,666
Then I've gotta do it!

869
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,753
We'll do whatever
we can to help out!

870
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:08,837
All right!

871
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:09,922
This way!

872
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,759
Charizard, use flamethrower!

873
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,266
Use hydro pump!

874
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:49,628
No, don't!

875
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:54,133
Cross!

876
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,303
I've gotta do this! Go!

877
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:06,144
You bit me the day we met too,
remember?

878
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:07,979
Remember?

879
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,315
Lycanroc, remember!

880
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:27,750
Lycanroc.

881
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,961
Marshadow!
Give me the rainbow wing.

882
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,261
Hit it right back
with iron tail!

883
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:48,395
Keep it up!

884
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,068
Lucaflo!

885
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,372
Cross!

886
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,014
Pikachu!

887
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,269
Let's go, buddy!

888
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,532
Dodge it!

889
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:48,497
Pikachu, use thunderbolt!

890
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:24,867
Pikachu!

891
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:00,986
Oh, ash...

892
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,591
Pikachu! Get inside, please?

893
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:30,970
I know you can't stand going
inside your poké ball, but...

894
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,185
You'll be protected!

895
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:45,614
Now you look, I don't think
you know who you're dealing with!

896
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:48,158
I'm Ash Ketchum,
from pallet town!

897
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,077
And I'm gonna be the world's

898
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:53,371
greatest Pokemon master!

899
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:56,040
Mess with me
and you're gonna lose!

900
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:26,571
Pikachu, why won't you
get in your poké ball?

901
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,242
It's because...

902
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,245
It's because...

903
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:37,082
I always want...
To be with you...

904
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:41,586
Pikachu, you...

905
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:55,053
Pikachu... you guys...
Where are you?

906
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,580
Pikachu!

907
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:36,761
We used to run like
this all the time!

908
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,851
Pikachu!

909
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,332
Pikachu...

910
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:49,710
Ash!

911
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:51,336
You're alright!

912
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:53,964
Verity! Sorrel!

913
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:15,485
When a rainbow flower
blooms upon rainbow rock,

914
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:17,320
ho-oh shall appear.

915
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,075
Yes! Now go, young man!

916
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:17,296
The one who is guided
by the rainbow wing...

917
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:21,093
May meet ho-oh...
And become the rainbow hero.

918
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:28,641
Ho?

919
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,101
Oh!

920
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:31,769
Yo, ho, ho-oh ho!

921
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:37,692
It's all downhill from here!
It's all downhill from here!

922
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:15,104
Looks like everybody's
healthy again!

923
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:17,524
And that's the power of ho-oh!

924
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:18,649
Pikachu?

925
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:30,995
Ho-oh! Let's have a battle!

926
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:57,772
Pikachu! I choose you!

927
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:00,692
Alright! Use thunderbolt!

928
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:44,152
Excuse me!

929
01:28:46,196 --> 01:28:48,740
Oh, my! You were battling,
weren't you?

930
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:50,074
Who was it this time?

931
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:51,618
It was ho-oh.

932
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:53,036
That's nice...

933
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:56,039
What?

934
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,086
The atmosphere is crystal clear!

935
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:03,922
Somewhere in the world...

936
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:08,092
There's a new trainer,
soon to be the rainbow hero.

937
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:10,511
Young men and women, live on!

938
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:12,472
Just keep on living on!

939
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:15,433
And if you do,
a path will open for you!

940
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:19,104
The future is bathed in
a rainbow-colored light!

941
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:31,199
I'm going to get even stronger.
And someday we'll battle again.

942
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:34,452
Okay! And I'll give it
everything I've got!

943
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:38,456
Just don't lose
to anyone before then.

944
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:50,552
This is where
our paths must part.

945
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:52,095
I'm off to learn
about the legends of

946
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:54,722
Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.

947
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,224
I think I'm going
to head on back home.

948
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:59,019
I'd really like to see my mom!

949
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:00,269
What about you?

950
01:30:00,437 --> 01:30:03,231
You know me!
I'm going my own way!

951
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:05,608
Working to become
a Pokémon master!

952
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:09,487
I hope we get to meet again
in the future.

953
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:18,830
Then we'll have a battle!
Then we'll have a battle!

954
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:58,536
Let's go, Pikachu!

955
01:31:05,335 --> 01:31:08,046
The always-fascinating
world of Pokémon,

956
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:11,091
the most diverse and
unusual creatures on the planet.

957
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:15,637
They can be found up in the sky,
under the sea, in forests,

958
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:16,888
and living in towns.

959
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:20,725
One can see Pokémon in
every corner of the world!

960
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:24,604
People and Pokémon,
forming all kinds of bonds,

961
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:26,606
and living
harmoniously in a world

962
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:28,149
made just for them...

963
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:36,907
And this young man,
Ash Ketchum from pallet town,

964
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:40,078
together with his partner Pikachu,
continues to work

965
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:43,289
toward his goal of
becoming a Pokémon master.

966
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:46,417
And as many
Pokémon as there are...

967
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:49,753
Well, our hero has just
as many dreams to follow,

968
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:53,007
and just as many
adventures to come!
