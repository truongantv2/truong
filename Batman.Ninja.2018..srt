The industrial revolution
wasn't until much later.

I really doubt the Joker
cares much about history.

193
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:35,560
My guess is whatever
he's doing,

194
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:37,728
he'll use it
to become Shogun.

But it's not
just the Joker.

We were lucky enough
to find each other here.

matter of time before you arrived.
