1
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,080
OP

2
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,680
ED

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Signs

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,710
Tell me, what lies at the end of that river?

5
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,490
The sea.

6
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,300
And beyond that sea?

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,460
Foreign lands.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,260
I would very much like to see how they live there.

9
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,710
They're coming from the sea?

10
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,050
How about the visitors closer to 
home? Did we take them out?

11
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,130
All mobile units here are responding to IFF signals.

12
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,200
However, some hostiles seem to have escaped from the premises.

13
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,780
Major!

14
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,330
I'm getting reports of similar occurrences outside of Japan as well!

15
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,200
Three squads have been confirmed already!

16
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,130
Any word from UN headquarters?

17
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,540
None.

18
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,010
There's too much conflicting information to tell what's happening.

19
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,130
But combat seems to breaking out all over the world.

20
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,370
Doomsday is upon us, huh?

21
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,380
Yukina! Are you all right?

22
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,630
What were you doing there?

23
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,690
Why didn't you just go home?

24
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,220
How should I know?

25
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,580
Was he kept on life support?

26
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,600
Or maybe it was cryogenic sleep?

27
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,380
Did he mention anything to you?

28
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,960
Only his name.

29
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,750
Wait, he spoke Japanese?

30
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,570
Yeah.

31
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,670
And what was his name?

32
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,660
Uh, Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma?

33
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,120
Never heard of it.

34
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,900
All right. Let's have a chat with him.

35
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,830
This is Director Shirahane.

36
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,350
The man from the cube should wake up soon, right?

37
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,960
What?

38
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,740
Well, yeah, but hang on. I'll be right there.

39
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,750
What's up, Hiromi?

40
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,500
Follow me, Paula.

41
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,560
And you return to your post, Jiro.

42
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,530
Wait, Director!

43
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,310
You stay put right here, Yukina.

44
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,680
Princess!

45
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,100
Sheesh.

46
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,730
Could this day get any worse?

47
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,350
Princess!

48
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,750
I wonder what he means by "Princess."

49
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,780
Is this...

50
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,510
Lab 4, apparently.

51
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,640
The hell is security doing?

52
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,910
Huh? It's open.

53
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,020
Which moron left it unlocked?

54
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,040
The director.

55
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,980
Again?

56
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,520
She forgets and runs off every now and then, doesn't she?

57
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,240
What's the point of quarantining him now?

58
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,960
He's out in the open already.

59
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,740
While it may be pointless,

60
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,060
he is a truly fascinating specimen.

61
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,390
If possible, I'd love to dissect him.

62
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,940
Uh, Dr. Hausen?

63
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,810
Apologies.

64
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,920
I was merely joking.

65
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,100
Er...

66
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,760
Kennosuke Ouma, was it?

67
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,160
Hello?

68
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,480
We'd like to have a chat with you.

69
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,820
He can understand Japanese, right?

70
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,030
Hiromi!

71
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,930
Unhand the director!

72
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,440
Let me out of here at once!

73
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,990
Or else I'll break your neck!

74
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,110
Oh, no!

75
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,950
Crap, he's dangerous!

76
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,010
What remarkable reflexes!

77
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,800
Princess!

78
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,620
He found me!

79
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,600
Pardon me!

80
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,880
Why'd you let him out?

81
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,450
What else was I supposed to do?

82
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,240
More importantly, why was Yukina there?

83
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,840
Hello.

84
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,200
The director?

85
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,400
You left your phone somewhere again, didn't you?

86
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,130
Shirahane speaking.

87
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,710
Huh? Permission to shoot?

88
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,910
No way!

89
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,930
What if you hit Yukina?!

90
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,670
Do not open fire under any circumstances!

91
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,010
I'm glad you're all right.

92
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,600
Who might you be?

93
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,150
Huh? Am I not your princess?

94
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,940
You are not! Who the hell are you, you conniving wench?!

95
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,570
"Conniving wench"?

96
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,860
Jerk! You're the one who mistook me for someone else!

97
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,510
Damn it!

98
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,100
So the princess really did...

99
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,660
And who are <i>you</i>, anyway?

100
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:48,590
A mere soldier tasked with protecting the princess.

101
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,230
How?!

102
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,580
What in the world is happening?

103
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,260
Why now?

104
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,270
It never responded to my calls before.

105
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,140
Steed!

106
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,950
You're kidding me.

107
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,940
Get in here.

108
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,220
W-Wait! What's going on here?

109
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,080
Yukina!

110
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,390
Below...

111
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,120
My instincts are telling me to travel downward.

112
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,930
This can't be happening!

113
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,150
Yukina?

114
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,740
The giant?

115
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,030
So it was here.

116
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,540
Wh-What is this?

117
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,660
A relic.

118
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,370
Relic?

119
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,930
The Black Relic.

120
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,790
My personal relic.

121
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,180
Ow!

122
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,270
What? What's all this?

123
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,690
Why do I understand it?

124
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,610
What now?

125
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,070
A demon!

126
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,120
A demon?

127
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,810
Sortie!

128
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,360
Crap!

129
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,080
Sorry!

130
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,980
What is this place?

131
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,350
The mountain peaks seem familiar...

132
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,980
But what is this lake?

133
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,120
Could it be the work of demons?

134
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,330
This is Kurobe Dam.

135
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,320
The manifestation of human genius!

136
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,900
Isn't it amazing?

137
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,450
What are you talking about, missy?

138
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,120
Yukina.

139
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,110
What?

140
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,820
I have a name.

141
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,670
Just how long have I been asleep?

142
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,780
Don't ask me.

143
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,930
I think the cube was found around 60 years ago,

144
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,060
so you've probably been asleep for even longer.

145
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,370
Lies! You shan't deceive me with your drivel!

146
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,420
I'm not trying to!

147
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,530
Uh...

148
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,380
Are you really from the past?

149
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,610
I haven't the foggiest what's past or present!

150
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,800
So it was destroyed?

151
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,240
Yes.

152
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,100
A combined assault by the JSDF and ASDF took out the one that landed in Nagano.

153
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,810
And while this is unconfirmed,

154
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,930
one seems to have been suppressed at the UN's Kurobe facility.

155
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,640
How did the security there manage that?

156
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,310
Apparently they used the GAUS.

157
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,180
The GAUS...

158
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,880
The remaining four are on the move!

159
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,050
Where are they headed?

160
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,900
Towards Object 1, which has made landfall in Toyama!

161
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,570
Another large mobile unit detected!

162
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,920
Where did it come from?

163
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,900
The Kurobe research facility.

164
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,560
If it continues down its current course, it'll meet up with Object 1!

165
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,400
I thought they took one out!

166
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,200
Colonel.

167
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,200
It's from Director Shirahane of the Kurobe research facility.

168
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,710
From the facility?

169
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,060
Hello?

170
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,680
This is Director Shirahane.

171
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,330
The large geoframe that just left this facility is the artifact codenamed Giant.

172
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,920
What? Giant?

173
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,350
Please don't attack it.

174
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,860
It's one of humanity's most prized assets.

175
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,450
Artifact?

176
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,570
{\an8}Disaster alert. Disaster alert.

177
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,490
{\an8}Further information will be relayed through television and radio broadcasts.

178
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,320
This is crazy!

179
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,820
What is?

180
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,650
Apparently some mysterious giant robot popped out of the sea!

181
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,710
Do you really think you'll catch a glimpse of it from there?

182
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,850
What in seven hells is that?!

183
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,800
Tributary... Distributary...

184
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,650
Crossroad gorge...

185
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,580
River terraces...

186
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,030
Braided streams!

187
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,840
Hey! Don't crush any homes!

188
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,470
No, no! Don't kick the bridge!

189
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,660
Such a pain in the neck.

190
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,920
Why can I tell?

191
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,710
Oh, is this a radar?

192
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,420
You understand it?

193
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,340
Y-Yeah.

194
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,250
I'm not sure why, but I do understand it.

195
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,390
How does <i>that</i> work?

196
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,800
Um, we'll be entering city limits soon, so please be careful.

197
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,390
City limits?

198
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
What the...

199
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,360
What is with that mountain of tombstones?

200
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,620
They're buildings, not tombs!

201
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,870
Buildings?

202
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,280
Don't destroy them, no matter what!

203
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,950
U-Uh...

204
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,020
What are you going to do now?

205
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,920
Regardless of how the world may change,

206
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,580
my duty remains the same:

207
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,800
slaying the demons!

208
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,020
What was that just now?

209
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,330
A demon.

210
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,040
A demon?

211
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,300
That's...

212
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,310
...a demon?

213
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,020
They will return to devour humans once more.

214
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,810
They really did return...

215
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,980
And wait, I'm gonna get eaten?!

216
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,840
No way! First I get abducted by a nutcase, and now some demon's gonna munch on my bones?

217
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,940
This is the pits!

218
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,280
Quit your whining!

219
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,710
Human lives don't matter to them in the least.

220
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,370
If we do not slay the demons here,

221
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,200
the entire world will perish!

222
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,980
There's a whole bunch of them now.

223
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,820
How many?

224
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,590
Uh, four!

225
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,830
A-And now we're surrounded!

226
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,850
What are we gonna do?!

227
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,800
It pierced through!

228
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,980
These rotten minions.

229
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,590
Left!

230
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,930
Behind!

231
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,910
What?!

232
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,650
Huh?

233
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,430
Scurrying around like a rodent...

234
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,310
Why do you fight the demons, Kennosuke?

235
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,730
To protect someone?

236
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,360
Because I hate them!

237
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,630
Get back! Above you!

238
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,600
You did well to notice!

239
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,320
This is the end!

240
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,750
Damn, I let it escape.

241
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,180
Say, do I resemble your princess?

242
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,000
Not in the least.

243
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,520
Why'd you mistake me for her, then?

244
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,850
Is that princess still out there somewhere?

245
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,090
The princess...

246
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,030
is dead.

247
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:35,130
We don't know anything about this black giant.

248
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,060
The samurai seems to be calling it the Black Relic, though.

249
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,160
Immorality creaks in the dark

250
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,720
Blurring the advantages of evolution

251
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,270
Sorrow remains silent

252
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,170
Simply praying for the safety of the soul

253
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,010
I'm always just barely behind the times

254
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,270
Surrounded by thick gray clouds

255
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,860
Acid rain pours down on me

256
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,440
Melting away my morals tonight

257
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,660
Everyone's assigned an alphabet

258
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,300
Everyone's called by their code

259
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,760
Acting with no sense of reason

260
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,950
For whom are these battles fought

261
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,970
The scar that remains in the corner of my memories

262
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,490
shed light to the end

263
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,050
A voice in the distance whispered gently

264
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,430
A new age is coming

265
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,870
Love transcends time

266
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,380
Dreams go the distance

267
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,260
Voices will reach to the ends of the earth

268
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,780
No matter how weak the light

269
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,280
I have the ultimate strength to believe

270
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,080
This is the strength of our bond

271
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,960
Love will transcend time

272
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,340
Everyone's lonely and a stranger to others

273
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,170
The names we are given

274
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:34,240
Can be easily taken away

275
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,580
The mirror shows our weaknesses

276
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,570
We can't look away from it

277
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:50,290
It is our feelings that make our hearts scream out in pain

278
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,030
Don't stop

279
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,340
Even if I have to take on the pain of others

280
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,370
I will change the world one step at a time

281
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,580
Acting on emotions won't help us understand each other

282
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,170
But I won't stop believing in my reality

283
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,430
I want to keep on living

284
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:21,980
Because ever since I met you

285
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,310
Something's taken root deep within my heart

286
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,690
And it is starting to bloom

287
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,450
{\an7\fs40}Mika (Cell): You alive?
 Me: Yeah, I am. You?

288
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,850
{\an7\fs40}Mika (Cell): You alive?
 Me: Yeah, I am. You? 
Mika(Cell): Taking shelter underground 
with my old man.

The Black Relic Awakened

00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,060
{\an7\fs30}Black Relic: 19.5m tall (21.9m including the horns).
 Humanoid relic found during dam construction work 60 years ago.
Along with the 3m cube, it is an artifact currently being researched at the Kurobe Research Facility.
