1
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:07,550
A long time ago, in a remote part
of Europe, in a place called "Vigrid"...

2
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:12,013
lived those who were known
as the observers of history.

3
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:15,391
The Umbra Witches, the
followers of darkness.

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,478
And the Lumen Sages, the
followers of the light.

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:24,108
<i>The witches were</i> in <i>league with demons
and the sages were allied with angels...</i>

6
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,610
<i>they</i> were responsible
for protecting the world...

7
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:30,531
<i>by keeping the right
balance between them.</i>

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,993
However, the balance was lost suddenly.

9
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:38,873
It <i>started because a sage and a witch
violated the decrees that bound them...</i>

10
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:43,294
and produced a child.

11
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:47,381
The woman was imprisoned
and the man was banished...

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,926
but that was only the beginning.

13
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:56,348
"The intersection of light and
dark will bring calamity to this earth."

14
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:02,271
That legend had become reality.

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,903
Right Eye and Left Eye
govern the power of creation.

16
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,421
The forbidden child,
who the witches took

17
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:15,993
charge of, possessed the
powers of Left Eye.

18
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:18,245
When the two eyes are brought together...

19
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:24,001
the Creator Jubileus will be made
incarnate and a New World will be created.

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,131
This is heaven's will and heaven's order.

21
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,428
The sages were on heaven's side,
the witches were against them...

22
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:40,601
resulting in a conflict over Left Eye.

23
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,097
The conflict grew and
grew until it became a

24
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:45,356
full-blown war between
angels and demons...

25
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:49,026
and the world was sent
hurtling towards destruction.

26
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:55,282
The sages and the witches died out
in droves, and the war came to an end.

27
00:01:55,491 --> 00:02:00,663
The truth of their existences
slipped into obscurity.

28
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,541
The forbidden child grew
up to be a witch...

29
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:09,296
<i>but</i> she was hidden away
and sealed in a secret place...

30
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:12,925
<i>500 years later...</i>

31
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:17,680
The witch, who hunts
angels, has returned...

32
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,700
"Mass suicide in Ragna church."

33
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,776
Fleur de Cirey...

34
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:33,088
I am the way into the city of woe.

35
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,883
I am the way to a forsaken people.

36
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,719
<i>I am the way into eternal sorrow.</i>

37
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:42,640
Abandon all hope ye who enter <i>here.</i>

38
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,434
I am the way into the city of woe.

39
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,395
I am the way to a forsaken people.

40
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,774
<i>I am the way into eternal sorrow.</i>

41
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,945
Abandon all hope ye who enter <i>here.</i>

42
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,122
What's going on?

43
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,635
This time, I'll reveal her
for who she really is.

44
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:03,447
Look what you've done to
my outfit. You're so impatient.

45
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:36,814
You presume too much.
I'm not the partner you seek.

46
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:42,403
It was a wonderful performance, Rodin.

47
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,988
But of course, Bayonetta.

48
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:48,909
By the way... is my Knight ready?

49
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:53,455
Whether you'll like him
or not is another thing.

50
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,177
The Elfin Knight.

51
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,139
<i>It is a good name for a knight's weapon.</i>

52
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,613
The fun's only just started.

53
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,734
What's going on?

54
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,221
Beautiful!

55
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,278
MY Car!

56
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,576
I'm still paying the loan.

57
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,474
This is bad!

58
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:26,108
I must become the cornerstone of Left Eye.

59
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:30,862
Unleash all your powers of darkness.

60
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,282
What are you talking about?

61
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,755
The Creator will soon return.

62
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,675
You're wasting your time.

63
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,100
What's going on here?

64
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:33,258
My infernal partner is
telling me he's hungry!

65
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:39,640
He'd be quite satisfied
with a catch like you.

66
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:55,447
It's dinnertime, my sweet.

67
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:07,084
Oh, I forgot. There's another
reason why I'm hunting you.

68
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:11,880
<i>I take</i> pleasure from watching
your face distort with pain.

69
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,926
Transform the world into
what it should <i>be...</i>

70
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,513
That's the face I was talking about.

71
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,640
It gets me so excited!!

72
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:26,687
Glory be to the Creator Jubileus!

73
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,791
You put on quite a show.

74
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,172
Did you like the Knight?

75
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,429
Not bad.

76
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:04,224
It'll do as a sidekick for a while.

77
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,145
Time to open the bar.

78
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,857
I'll be waiting.

79
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,276
If I can be bothered.

80
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:20,532
I'll prepare Mysterious
Destiny with an olive.

81
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,923
I thought it was a mouse.
But it was you, Cheshire.

82
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:41,511
The name's Luka. It's about
time you remembered.

83
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,472
What is it?

84
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,642
Guys who stalk the ladies
never get the girl.

85
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,021
I wouldn't worry. I've got the looks.

86
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:56,485
Claire, Trish, Sylvia, and
Ammy are all crazy about me.

87
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,946
I'm impressed you have so many friends.

88
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,950
But it's not nice to be a peeping Tom.

89
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,702
Such a bad boy.

90
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,415
Stop it! That's professional equipment.

91
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:15,670
Not to mention, you made
a huge dent in my car!

92
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,215
Did I?

93
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:24,554
Did it conveniently slip your mind again?

94
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:31,937
I'll never forget what
happened 20 years ago.

95
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,897
Fleur de Cirey.

96
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,776
I'll always remember the smell.

97
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:46,243
The same smell from the day
my father died... the day I first saw you.

98
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,095
Father!

99
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,223
Father”.

100
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,976
As a journalist...

101
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,646
I'll expose you for who you are.

102
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,565
That's a turn on.

103
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,108
Remember this.

104
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,862
You can disappear,
but I'll know you by your scent.

105
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,365
The famous perfume, Fleur de Cirey.

106
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:29,452
The sweet essence of rosemary.

107
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,788
It doesn't suit you.

108
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:35,417
You don't know that much
about perfume do you, Cheshire?

109
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,710
My name's Luka!

110
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:40,797
Rosemary isn't used in Fleur de Cirey.

111
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,133
I wear it to ward off evil spirits.

112
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:47,971
A witch with a perfume to
ward off evil? That's a laugh.

113
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,015
They heard the commotion.

114
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,434
See you, Cheshire.

115
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,811
Bayonetta, wait!

116
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,398
This isn't good.

117
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,403
The reawakening is close.

118
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,657
Good girl.

119
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:54,496
There are demons in places like this.
You should go somewhere safer.

120
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,929
I am here in front of the
lthavoll Tower, in Vigrid...

121
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,264
<i>a</i> sacred site of the Ragna.

122
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,279
This year, the 500-year
wait for the return of

123
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,229
the Creator Jubileus is
meant to come to an end.

124
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:24,484
Believers all around the world
are joyously celebrating his coming.

125
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,874
Meanwhile, however, we
continue to hear of believers

126
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,657
committing suicide "to
aid the resurrection."

127
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,118
Only yesterday a head
priest of the Ragna...

128
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:37,122
committed suicide
with over 20 believers.

129
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:43,169
Unknown parties later partially destroyed
the cathedral housing their bodies.

130
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:47,507
This has prompted many countries
to pronounce states of emergency...

131
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:51,720
<i>and believers of Ragna
have been asked to remain calm.</i>

132
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:56,057
The supreme leader of the lthavoll Group,
who effectively governs this sacred city...

133
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,561
<i>is</i> preparing to appear
in public for the first time.

134
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,272
The humans are panicking.

135
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,773
It's pathetic!

136
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:08,069
Sacrificing themselves for
the resurrection of some god?

137
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:13,742
But it's thanks to these
idiots that I'm in business.

138
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,038
You're overcharging for
the funerals you're taking on.

139
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,957
You're not such a good guy, either.

140
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:25,670
I'm a good guy. As long
as I'm making money!

141
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:32,052
Anyone with a conscience wouldn't
want to handle these crazy believers.

142
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,432
When you look at it,
I'm quite the philanthropist.

143
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,436
If that's the case,
you should be donating to the Church.

144
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,315
And you owe me my reward.

145
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,360
Don't make me laugh. You
enjoy killing angels.

146
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:53,907
You take pleasure in it, right?
Isn't that enough?

147
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:57,202
Hey, wait. Slow down.

148
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,536
I'm sorry?

149
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:04,042
Shit!! You're the one
that trashed the cathedral.

150
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,421
So I say goodbye to any profit.
Consider my position!

151
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,965
I offer my condolences.

152
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:15,261
But the deal was information in
exchange for a troublesome funeral.

153
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,180
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

154
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:23,144
You're damn bossy for someone
who can't even remember her own name.

155
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,064
<i>Her name is Bayonetta.</i>

156
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,526
That's the name you gave her.

157
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:33,530
It's been 20 years since she <i>awoke</i>
from her coffin at the bottom of that <i>lake.</i>

158
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:38,868
But she's still one big mystery... the only
thing she remembers is that she's a witch.

159
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:42,956
Killing angels and offering
them up to demons is great and all,

160
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,626
but she might as well do work
more likely to make some money...

161
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:50,088
Men who blabber lead short lives.

162
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:57,095
And here he is. Mr. Balder,
the leader of the lthavoll Group.

163
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:03,768
It's fair to say that the Group's vast
fortune supports the economy of Vigrid.

164
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:07,856
If Mr. Balder, revered by
his followers, tackles this well...

165
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,024
Oh, that's him!

166
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:13,987
I'll give you the lowdown
on him as your reward.

167
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:17,115
He's the head of the Ragna.

168
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,910
Apparently, it's the first time
he's shown his face in public.

169
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,206
This coincides with the
first resurrection in 500 years.

170
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:29,836
Some say he has been alive
since the last resurrection.

171
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,672
If that's the truth, he's not human.

172
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:37,468
The lthavoll Group has cutting-edge
technology that ain't exactly in keeping

173
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,054
with the "good old religious hub" image.

174
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,641
The believers <i>see</i> technology
as a holy miracle.

175
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:51,850
According to informants, Balder is
a descendent of the long lost sages...

176
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,613
the votaries of light and enemy
of the witches spoken of in folklore.

177
00:19:56,821 --> 00:20:00,575
A modern day sage...

178
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:04,370
A tasty snippet of info, right?

179
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:15,506
I'm waiting, my dear child.

180
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,555
She seems happy with the reward.

181
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,600
I am going home.

182
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:29,270
My sons are going to throw
me a birthday party.

183
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,940
Not paying for your drinks again?

184
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:37,403
That's your birthday present, right?
Thank you.

185
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:41,658
I'll contact you when I get a job.

186
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,203
Freaky undertaker.

187
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,538
Ciao!

188
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:01,094
You were holding that when you awoke.

189
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,387
Yes.

190
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,807
It doesn't help you to remember?

191
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,017
<i>Well...</i>

192
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:14,190
At the moment, that man,
Balder, interests me more.

193
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:19,237
He holds the key to my lost memory.

194
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:23,741
Is that what Enzo's info told you?

195
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:29,414
Call it woman's intuition.

196
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,666
So you're going to Vigrid?

197
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,584
Yes.

198
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,804
Take whatever you want.

199
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:08,202
I've waited 500 years
for this time to come.

200
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:12,040
The girl will find her way here in the end.

201
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:17,503
And will history repeat itself? <i>Or...</i>

202
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:22,050
Her path is predestined.
And I'll tell you why.

203
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:28,681
I understand the rules of
the three worlds. I see it all.

204
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:34,687
Our actions will help in the
reconstruction of the supreme world.

205
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:38,775
It's ironic that Right Eye
should choose chaos over order.

206
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,320
You're wrong. The world
is already in chaos.

207
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,531
My daughter and I must
become the Eyes of the World.

208
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,917
Until the three worlds
form a perfect whole,

209
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:52,330
there will be no true
order, no true salvation.

210
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,707
The logic of a madman.

211
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:58,002
You don't have the capacity to understand.

212
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:01,881
How unfortunate that you
cannot part with me.

213
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,552
The angels are working hard for me.

214
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:10,765
You too, Jeanne.

215
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,103
<i>We've waited 500 years.</i>

216
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:19,649
You must be looking forward
to seeing her again.

217
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:25,363
Everything we do is to prepare for
the coming of the Creator, Jubileus.

218
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:31,869
The Creation of a New World draws close.

219
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,678
<i>The data's intact...</i>

220
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,308
Yet I still couldn't capture her true form.

221
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:59,021
Where will I find you next, Bayonetta?

222
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:10,074
<i>Ragna... the descendent of the sages...</i>

223
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:20,543
When my father tried to uncover
the truth about the sages and witches...

224
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,588
<i>Bayonetta killed him.</i>

225
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:51,824
Awaken, dear daughter!

226
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,289
Daddy?

227
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:02,043
<i>Yes... come here.</i>

228
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,762
Excuse me, but who are you?

229
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:17,201
You possess the same magic powers as me.

230
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,080
I'm going to ask you again. Who are you?

231
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:26,544
Your extended sleep seems
to have dulled your senses.

232
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:32,466
Have I met you before?
You seem to know who I am.

233
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:36,053
I may know that better than you do.

234
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,306
I'm even more curious.

235
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:42,310
If you can defeat me, I'll explain.

236
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,614
The fun's just begun.

237
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:19,096
I remember this. What about you?

238
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,890
Thanks for your concern.

239
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:24,977
I get the feeling I'll remember
once I've knocked you down.

240
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,104
You're so slow.

241
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:15,361
Is that all you have?

242
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:20,491
I don't know. I think I <i>have a</i>
few other tricks up my sleeve.

243
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,203
What else can you do with that toy?

244
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:27,998
I'll show you. You still
want to play, right?

245
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,212
You must be kidding...

246
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:36,090
We're not getting anywhere.

247
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:24,180
Hey, Daddy. Is Mummy here?

248
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:30,394
If you're a good girl,
Mummy will come for you very soon.

249
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,688
<i>Cereza's a good girl!</i>

250
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,900
You can wait on your own?

251
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,359
Of course!

252
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,374
Cheshire. It's okay, right?

253
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:56,337
Please come quickly, Mummy.

254
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:26,659
I don't recall this bar being here.

255
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,036
It's a temporary outpost.

256
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:32,957
Isn't there something you want to tell me?

257
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:37,837
They sure didn't live up to
the "Knight" name, did they?

258
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,756
What did you do to them?

259
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:44,844
All I did was have a
shootout with some bitch.

260
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,889
You were shooting at yourself?

261
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,560
I'll repair them.

262
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,938
Make them a little tougher next time.

263
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,442
Fancy a drink?

264
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:07,366
I'm in a hurry. I look forward
to a more satisfactory Knight.

265
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,553
Mummy, where are you?

266
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,347
Mummy...

267
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:46,280
Rodin's not the only one
who wants me to take a detour.

268
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:49,074
<i>Where</i> am I <i>exactly?</i>

269
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:52,995
It's no party spot.

270
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:57,291
Mummy! Mummy!

271
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,797
Mummy?

272
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,133
Mummy!

273
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:09,386
Mummy! Mummy!

274
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,724
A ghost!

275
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,310
Can you see angels?

276
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,863
Mummy! Mummy!

277
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,283
This is troublesome!

278
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,975
You want to play, huh? Let me oblige.

279
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,790
Cheshire! Cheshire!

280
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,625
Cheshire?

281
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,887
Mummy!

282
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,181
Stop crying-

283
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,852
I hate crybabies as much
as I hate cockroaches.

284
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,230
And I'm not your mother!

285
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,606
Okay.

286
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,692
Mummy...

287
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,572
You take cover, little one.

288
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,284
An angel seeks my attention.

289
00:33:55,492 --> 00:34:00,164
But it doesn't seem to
want to harm this little girl.

290
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:05,836
Tell me why you went to
the trouble of bringing me here.

291
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,255
We're going to be safe, right?

292
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:12,301
I must become the cornerstone
of resurrection.

293
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,845
Come on. Let's dance!

294
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,979
I'm going to enjoy this.

295
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,249
Mummy!

296
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,220
You find me that engaging?

297
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,348
You want to take me by force?

298
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,558
Bad boy!

299
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:05,979
It seems I'll have to teach you a lesson!

300
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:23,122
Come on, then. Let's dance, baby!!

301
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:28,460
Glory be to the Creator Jubileus!

302
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:55,154
Mummy! Mummy!

303
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:59,158
What's your name, little one?

304
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,868
<i>Cereza.</i>

305
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,287
Have you forgotten, Mummy?

306
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,832
I probably won't remember
you later, either.

307
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,376
What are you doing in
such a dreadful place?

308
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:14,631
Daddy told me to wait here for Mummy.

309
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,675
He left you alone?

310
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:20,095
I'm not alone. Cheshire's here.

311
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,097
You were crying like a baby.

312
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:24,683
Mummy, let's go home.

313
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:29,313
How many times do I have
to tell you? I'm not your mother.

314
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,940
Your father will be back soon.

315
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:35,611
But I want to stay with you, Mummy.

316
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,740
This is awkward.

317
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,666
Come here.

318
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:53,045
Okay. Mummy!

319
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,255
Ouch!

320
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,636
You're very clumsy.

321
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,120
What is it, Mummy?

322
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,248
Little one, what's this?

323
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:33,710
You gave it to me for my birthday, Mummy.

324
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:38,924
No more falling over.

325
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,634
Okay!

326
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,972
Hold on tight!

327
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,431
Okay. Mummy!

328
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,683
And no more "Mummy."

329
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:50,102
Okay. Mummy!

330
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:29,224
It's been forever since we
took a bath together! This is fun!

331
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:30,726
Honestly!

332
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:34,187
You nagged me into it.

333
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,822
You don't live with your mother?

334
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:49,202
You know I don't. I've
lived on my own for ages.

335
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:51,371
Your mother hates crybabies, too.

336
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,166
But I'm not a crybaby!

337
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:57,669
Mummy! Why didn't you come to see me?

338
00:38:57,878 --> 00:39:00,047
Why did you <i>leave</i> me alone?

339
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,257
I don't know.

340
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:05,719
Because I'm not your mother.

341
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,138
I hate you!

342
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:14,227
You were all alone?

343
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:16,688
Any friends?

344
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,357
Cheshire.

345
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:34,956
It's so pretty! Just like snow!

346
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,043
What a pushover...

347
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,886
I don't recall asking for room service.

348
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:51,765
You should think about your methods.
Someone could sue.

349
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,477
Not so many methods to
choose from with a witch.

350
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,145
Oh!

351
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,690
Who is he?

352
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,567
Cheshire... No.

353
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:06,571
He's a perverted old guy
who photographs ladies.

354
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,948
Pervert?

355
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,241
Mummy?

356
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,910
You have a daughter?

357
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,579
Of course not.

358
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:18,708
But the process of making
a baby interests me.

359
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:23,171
Well, I'm not interested...

360
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,925
Not interested... at all...

361
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:32,180
Not... interested... <i>at all!</i>

362
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:34,766
Oh! He fell!

363
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,935
Is the old guy dead?

364
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:40,856
No ghost is coming to
fetch him, so he must be alive.

365
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,983
Unfortunately.

366
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:49,030
I'm not an old guy.

367
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,061
Asleep already?

368
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,063
You're very persistent.

369
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:26,651
How much longer do you intend to hang
around with that toy of yours, Cheshire?

370
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,403
The name's Luka.

371
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:38,413
Bayonetta, what's happening in this city?

372
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:39,873
I don't care.

373
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,542
Why are you here, then?

374
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,586
It's none of your business.

375
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:49,674
It's everything to do with <i>me...</i>
you killed my father.

376
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,719
I've heard enough of that assumption.

377
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:55,180
Don't play innocent with me.

378
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,307
My father was a journalist...

379
00:41:57,516 --> 00:42:04,314
who devoted his life to solving
the mystery of the sages and the witches.

380
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:11,238
Though he probably never
dreamed he'd be killed by a witch...

381
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:16,785
By revealing your identity,
perhaps I can uncover the truth he sought.

382
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:21,081
According to his notes,
about 500 years ago...

383
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:25,085
the sages and the witches
suddenly disappeared...

384
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:28,129
and their legend was lost.

385
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:32,509
<i>However, the witch, Bayonetta,
reappeared 20 years ago.</i>

386
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:36,513
And now a descendent of the sages,
Balder, has come forward.

387
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:40,767
It must have something
to do with the resurrection.

388
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:43,019
You're going to see Balder, right?

389
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,897
Possibly...

390
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:51,194
You'll understand why you killed
my father when you regain your memory.

391
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:54,364
And what happened that day...

392
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,283
Mummy!

393
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,494
Mummy! Where did you go?

394
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:01,288
Little one.

395
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:05,750
I'm busy babysitting.
I wish you could take over.

396
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,794
Well, that's a good idea.

397
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:10,589
Mummy!

398
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:15,010
Mummy. Where did you go? I was lonely.

399
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:18,597
If you cry for one more second,
I won't sleep with you.

400
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:22,642
You'll never <i>leave me</i> again, right?

401
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,590
What's up, little girl?

402
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:58,094
I'm <i>a...</i> I'm a crybaby.

403
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:01,514
So my mummy left me.

404
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,767
Bayonetta's gone?

405
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,268
She didn't!

406
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:08,980
She was serious about me babysitting you?!

407
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:12,776
Let's go look for your Mummy together.

408
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,695
Yes, old guy.

409
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,908
Listen, I'm not old, okay?

410
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,910
Yes, old guy.

411
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:25,413
Let's get 90309-

412
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:33,463
The two eyes that govern the
world <i>are</i> about to be reunited.

413
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:41,012
With the resurrection of the Creator
Jubileus at hand, the angels are restless.

414
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:45,100
You will be sacrificed in
order to awaken Left Eye.

415
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:48,603
We are in consensus...

416
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:53,233
All of this is to fulfill our goal.

417
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:58,947
For the Creation of a New World!

418
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:25,348
That's a nice car.

419
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:28,768
It is a pity it'll end up in the scrapyard.

420
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,405
What is it?

421
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,616
What? Something's coming this way?

422
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,369
Can you see something?

423
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:47,871
No.

424
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,039
They piss me off.

425
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,170
She put on quite a show.

426
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:42,133
Your mummy is easy to follow.

427
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:44,052
Yes!

428
00:46:57,941 --> 00:47:03,238
You've had enough fun. It's my turn now.

429
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:18,419
Mmmm.

430
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:22,423
Ask me out with a nicer car next time.

431
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:37,105
Not again... this is taking its toll on me.

432
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:42,986
May my soul reside with
the Creator, Jubileus.

433
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:47,073
Old guy. We haven't caught up
with Mummy yet, right?

434
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:49,909
<i>Nearly there. Be patient.</i>

435
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:51,119
Okay.

436
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:56,249
Once we see the airport, we'll be close
to the island with the lthavoll Tower.

437
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,209
We'll find your mother.

438
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:00,253
<i>Reafly?</i>

439
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,213
Yeah.

440
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:08,386
As long as the airport itself is intact.

441
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:09,637
Here's the exit.

442
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:11,556
Wow!

443
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,938
What's going on?

444
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:22,483
This is overdoing it,
even by Bayonetta's standards!

445
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:25,486
That ghost is big!

446
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:28,156
Mummy!

447
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:39,959
Retreat! Retreat!

448
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:12,825
The more I hunt angels,
the more powerful I feel.

449
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,703
What a turn on!

450
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:35,890
It suits you!

451
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:59,247
Damn Bayonetta! If I can't find
transport we're going to be in trouble.

452
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,459
We're going to escape in that, little girl.

453
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:04,668
Wait!

454
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:05,920
What is it?

455
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:07,129
Put me down.

456
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:09,257
You'll get burned.

457
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:11,634
Did you see Mummy?

458
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,344
Ghosts.

459
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:15,805
Ghosts?

460
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:19,100
Ghosts are coming!!

461
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:22,729
Don't be silly. I can't see a thing.

462
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,566
I smell rosemary.

463
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,609
Old guy?

464
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:34,032
Little girl, your older
brother's eyesight is good.

465
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,908
It's time to go.

466
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,910
Put these on!

467
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:40,913
Very well.

468
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:51,132
What are they? Could they be angels?

469
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,346
Little girl, is this really happening?

470
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,140
Whoa!

471
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:04,520
Hey, are they really angels?

472
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,857
They look like monsters.

473
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:27,835
You actually chased me here?

474
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,508
You must be mad.

475
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:35,510
Mummy!

476
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:49,190
Is that an angel, too?

477
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:50,398
Mummy!

478
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,777
She'll be fine!

479
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:17,051
Little girl, is your
mother fighting the monsters?

480
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,721
Mummy's a witch.
She's strong and protects others.

481
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,307
A witch... who protects others?

482
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:25,351
Yeah, of course!

483
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:30,898
I'm going to become a
strong witch to protect Mummy.

484
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:58,092
Now, how pretty will the explosion be?

485
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:22,408
Great! Mummy beat the ghosts!

486
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,077
<i>Take these back.</i>

487
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:26,579
What?

488
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,291
Are they magic glasses?

489
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,499
No.

490
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:34,587
You can see ghosts
without glasses, you know.

491
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:47,683
Angels? But I can still smell her.

492
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,524
Mummy!

493
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,155
Little one... are you crying?

494
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:02,782
No, I'm not!

495
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,659
Good.

496
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:09,538
I wanted you to babysit her at home.

497
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,290
Luka.

498
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,043
How many times have I told you?

499
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:18,130
I'm not Luka. I'm Cheshire!

500
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:21,467
Will you stop taking the piss?

501
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,053
This is Cheshire.

502
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:25,972
What?

503
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:36,774
Will you take us to the
lthavoll Tower? Cheshire...

504
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:44,532
You're in luck. That's just
where this helicopter is headed.

505
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:48,369
I'm seeing this through to the end.

506
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:54,166
The Umbra witch...

507
00:54:54,375 --> 00:55:02,091
possesses the outstanding
power the sage spoke of.

508
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:07,555
The two eyes of darkness and light...

509
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:11,475
that observed this world for many years.

510
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:15,604
The Creation of a New World is here.

511
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:21,360
Umbra witch, receive the
blessings of Jubileus.

512
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:29,869
<i>Here we are!!</i>

513
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:37,752
It's good to see you, my dear.

514
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,755
The hardship is nearly over.

515
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:47,136
The signpost to your
lost memory is waiting.

516
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:53,476
Give me everything you've got.
Everything...

517
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:14,705
Damn!

518
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,587
It's on our tail!

519
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,761
Oh! We're safe?

520
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:30,888
<i>Where's Bayonetta?</i>

521
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:47,822
You're <i>late.</i> I've been waiting.

522
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:52,618
I hope you're going to
entertain me this time.

523
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:55,246
You'll find out soon.

524
00:56:55,454 --> 00:57:01,043
This time, I'll make you
spill everything you know.

525
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,923
Do your best... if you can.

526
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,913
Isn't it a shame that you have
to fight with such a crappy weapon!

527
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:39,999
I can still sense your fear.

528
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,750
Fear?

529
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,378
Your memory will make things clear.

530
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:49,133
You instinctively fear
the fate that you bear.

531
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:55,431
"The intersection of light and
dark would bring calamity to this earth."

532
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,683
It's an ancient saying.

533
00:57:57,892 --> 00:58:02,688
The calamity resulted in the
downfall of the witches and the sages.

534
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:05,691
The effects can be felt even now...

535
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,404
centered around you,
the forbidden child.

536
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:16,327
Put simply, the Creator's power
is known as the Eyes of the World.

537
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:22,374
You possess half of the power...
the power of Left Eye.

538
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:29,673
Intruder...

539
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:38,599
Where am I?

540
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:41,352
I've been waiting, Left Eye.

541
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:44,813
Witch Jeanne...

542
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:49,693
Hindering the coming of the
Creator Jubileus will not be permitted.

543
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:54,281
You think an angel has the
right to order a witch around?

544
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:56,617
Beat it.

545
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:02,289
Foolish one.

546
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:07,628
Left Eye, I'll be waiting
by the side of my Lord.

547
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:24,144
Well, this looks like a fun place!

548
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:27,356
More entertaining than your bar.

549
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:37,032
How many times do I have to say?
I'm not who you're looking for.

550
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:50,588
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Here are your guns.

551
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:55,593
I hope they'll satisfy me this time.

552
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,970
And more to boot.

553
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:10,316
Scarborough Fair. Your new Knight.

554
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,110
It's had a radical transformation.

555
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:29,627
See you in the bar.

556
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:32,921
If I ever miss the boredom...

557
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:37,343
We seem to be on an equal footing now.

558
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:41,388
That's right. I'll try
to be gentle with you.

559
01:00:41,597 --> 01:00:48,062
Let's be clear, if you lose to me,
that girl of yours will disappear.

560
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:07,915
That's it! That's the idea!

561
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,000
I remember...

562
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:16,507
Jeanne, in accordance with witch law,

563
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:20,260
we will now test your worthiness
to be one of our greatest warriors.

564
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:23,347
Choose an opponent.

565
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,974
I'll take the outcast.

566
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:28,936
That is not permitted!

567
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:34,400
It is not allowed to engage with
the one cursed with tainted blood.

568
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:43,117
I remember... I've been here before.

569
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:48,247
At last! Let the memories return!

570
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:57,589
Your memory... do you fear it?

571
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:30,497
Can you feel your strength
increase as your memory returns?

572
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:34,793
It is the mission of us
witches to protect Left Eye.

573
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:38,797
Even if the forbidden child possesses it.

574
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:41,049
Us witches?

575
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:37,189
<i>Mama. Mama.</i>

576
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:50,327
The Left Eye of the witches is ours now.

577
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,372
<i>Left Eye...</i>

578
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:59,211
Let us seek out the Creator Jubileus.

579
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:04,383
The greatest treasure of
my clan, "Left Eye"...

580
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,885
I will not hand it over!

581
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:30,367
<i>Jeanne, you saved me.</i>

582
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:43,422
When you lost your mother,
you also lost the will to fight.

583
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,885
It was the only thing
I could do to protect Left Eye.

584
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:53,515
We were lucky to have had
an innocent childhood.

585
01:04:53,724 --> 01:04:55,976
<i>Yes...</i>

586
01:04:57,311 --> 01:05:01,648
You were my only friend...

587
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:07,237
And that silly doll of yours.

588
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,783
<i>Jeanne...</i>

589
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:16,872
500 years ago... why did you choose me?

590
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,167
Everyone hated me.

591
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:26,465
To become one of the most powerful witches,
I had to defeat the strongest opponent.

592
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,383
That's all.

593
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:33,263
You cannot run from the sage Balder.

594
01:05:33,472 --> 01:05:36,308
Bring an end to it all.

595
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:39,895
That's your destiny.

596
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:44,733
Fight, win and create a new path.

597
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:47,861
You can do it!

598
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,370
<i>Jeanne!</i>

599
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:08,340
<i>Jeanne.</i>

600
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:12,344
Mummy!

601
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:18,809
Got here without any fuss.
Seems like I'm a guest, too.

602
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:22,396
Mummy...?

603
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:27,150
Little one, what's your greatest treasure?

604
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:28,652
Cheshire?

605
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:29,611
No.

606
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,655
Cheshire's a friend.

607
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:35,617
This is my greatest treasure.

608
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:43,625
You should never let a treasure go.

609
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:46,545
Whatever happens.

610
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:49,548
I know! I won't cry any more.

611
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:54,177
I want to be like you.
You never run away from anything!

612
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:56,304
I'm gonna try hard.

613
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,272
You're not going on your own?

614
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:08,817
You'll tag along anyway, right?

615
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:10,902
Right?

616
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:30,589
It's as if we're being asked inside.
That's very generous.

617
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:33,550
My darling daughter...

618
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:37,888
It's time to open the "Eyes of the World."

619
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,766
It's Daddy! Daddy's voice!

620
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,392
Wait!

621
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:43,935
It's Daddy!

622
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:45,562
This way!

623
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:47,189
Little one...

624
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,950
Mummy! Mummy's here too, Daddy!

625
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:07,000
I've waited a long time
for this family reunion.

626
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,420
<i>Save him...</i>

627
01:08:12,214 --> 01:08:14,674
Did you have a good journey?

628
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:18,303
Yes. Mummy's very strong!

629
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:19,805
<i>I see...</i>

630
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:24,851
I was scared of the ghosts,
but Mummy told me not to cry.

631
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,312
You've grown strong, Cereza.

632
01:08:27,521 --> 01:08:28,897
Yes!

633
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,317
Today you must sleep in your own room.

634
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:37,614
But I don't want to.
There's so much I want to tell you.

635
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:42,953
You can tell me tomorrow.

636
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:45,747
<i>Oh... okay.</i>

637
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:47,916
Good girl.

638
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:52,420
Sweet dreams!

639
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:55,298
Yes... good night.

640
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,180
Mummy...

641
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:06,768
It's okay... I won't cry
anymore, even if I'm alone.

642
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:09,813
Clever girl.

643
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,232
Good night, Mummy.

644
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:20,699
How did you bring me from the past?

645
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,702
The past... what?

646
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:30,125
I opened the door of space-time distorted
by the influence of Jubileus's coming.

647
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:37,174
I wanted you to see this foolish
world through innocent, untainted eyes.

648
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:40,177
So this man is...?

649
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:43,305
The last surviving Lumen Sage.

650
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:46,766
The cause of everything. And...

651
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:51,605
<i>little one's... no, my Daddy.</i>

652
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:57,569
I've been waiting 500 years...

653
01:09:58,278 --> 01:10:01,698
for a chance to purge
the chaotic worlds...

654
01:10:01,907 --> 01:10:04,743
<i>of</i> heaven, hell and the human world...

655
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:08,380
With the resurrection
of Jubileus, the three

656
01:10:08,392 --> 01:10:11,374
worlds will become
void and be reborn.

657
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:17,923
Cereza, you and I will
become gods of this new world!

658
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:23,428
<i>Leave</i> it <i>to the leader
of the lthavoll Group.</i>

659
01:10:23,637 --> 01:10:27,015
You're the master of blowing your own horn.

660
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:30,810
But it's not enough to make the headlines.

661
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:33,230
You're Luka, right?

662
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:36,316
I've been watching your progress.

663
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:40,403
Like your father,
you've become a great journalist.

664
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:42,405
You knew my father?

665
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:46,409
He did some good
investigative work on my plan...

666
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:50,497
Everything was fine until
he found Cereza...

667
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:54,668
but he was a little too ambitious.

668
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:57,379
<i>Wh...</i> What are you doing?

669
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,548
The scent of rosemary...

670
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:04,094
That's the scent... I
remember from that day.

671
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:19,693
<i>I see</i> it <i>now...</i> it <i>was you...</i>

672
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,194
Your angels killed my father...

673
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:26,116
My condolences on your loss.

674
01:11:27,242 --> 01:11:31,788
Bayonetta, please forgive me.

675
01:11:32,414 --> 01:11:34,374
Never mind that.

676
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:41,548
Well, even that little crybaby
decided never to cry again.

677
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:46,219
So it's time for me to man up
and bring everything to an end!

678
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:52,934
Such crude methods for a journalist.

679
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:57,772
Luka!

680
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:07,198
Cereza, the journey ends here.

681
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:12,996
I don't understand.
Why did you summon the younger me?

682
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:16,708
Why bother with such
convoluted plans to bring me here?

683
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:22,047
You lost your memory completely...

684
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:27,218
In order to open Left Eye, you must
reclaim your power, your experience,

685
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:31,514
and your love.

686
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:35,643
Not only did you try to
throw the world into chaos...

687
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:39,689
but you killed Mama.
What do you know of love?

688
01:12:39,898 --> 01:12:42,984
It wasn't me who killed Rosa.

689
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:45,862
The distortion of the world tore us apart.

690
01:12:46,071 --> 01:12:51,284
Angels anxious for the
resurrection killed her.

691
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:58,124
The angels chose to fight you and became
sacrifices to enhance your magic powers.

692
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:01,127
Jeanne was the final ingredient.

693
01:13:01,336 --> 01:13:06,424
She unleashed your full power
and regained the core of you.

694
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:10,095
Your memory, in other words.

695
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:13,848
Jeanne did very well.

696
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:20,146
You're crazy.

697
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:22,399
I beg to differ.

698
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:27,654
It is not me who's crazy,
it's the world itself.

699
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,450
Can you really shoot me?

700
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,830
You don't think I can?

701
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:41,167
You're going to shoot me? Your father?

702
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:48,675
<i>My dearest daughter, Cereza.</i>

703
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:03,898
Let's hail the dawning of
a new order and a new world.

704
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:49,360
The rebirth of the Creator?
You must be kidding...

705
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:07,795
Jubileus... walk with us!

706
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:20,475
We must become one with Jubileus.

707
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:45,833
The time has come at last.

708
01:15:46,376 --> 01:15:51,464
We will become the Creator of a New World.

709
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:10,066
Don't tell me that's Jubileus?!

710
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:11,901
<i>Bayonetta!</i>

711
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:21,661
It's wonderful!

712
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:28,251
My daughter, this is the
beginning of the new world.

713
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,423
<i>Cereza...</i>

714
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:35,550
Mama...?

715
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:40,805
<i>Please... save him...</i>

716
01:16:41,014 --> 01:16:45,768
His soul is trapped in madness.

717
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,896
<i>Save him...</i>

718
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:57,196
<i>Yes, Mama...</i>

719
01:16:57,405 --> 01:17:02,493
I must do now what I couldn't then.

720
01:17:14,589 --> 01:17:18,259
Jeanne, you're still alive?

721
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:23,014
"The intersection of light and
dark will bring calamity to this earth."

722
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:26,392
So it has another meaning.

723
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:30,605
<i>No,</i>this is the real meaning!
You're too <i>late...</i>

724
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:35,568
You are not needed in this new world.

725
01:17:35,777 --> 01:17:37,654
I'm not?

726
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:48,164
Return our greatest treasure to us!

727
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:03,262
<i>Jeanne...</i> You must
open your eyes!

728
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:07,016
Finish what started 500 years ago.

729
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:12,021
No time to hesitate! Cereza!!

730
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:25,702
<i>I certainly need to keep my eye on you!</i>

731
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:28,121
You're not dead yet?

732
01:18:45,263 --> 01:18:51,811
You fools... What
have you done?!

733
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:55,481
What have you done?!

734
01:19:19,547 --> 01:19:21,299
A regular pet isn't good enough!

735
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:23,509
It would appear so.

736
01:19:23,718 --> 01:19:27,138
My dear daughter, Cereza.

737
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:30,057
How dare you turn a sword on me?

738
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:38,266
I won't have it!

739
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,613
This is celestial power, huh?

740
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:46,741
Cereza, you must follow through.

741
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:51,078
Of course... but we must do it together.

742
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:52,288
What?

743
01:19:52,497 --> 01:19:54,791
<i>I've got a special weapon.</i>

744
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:00,171
Sounds good to me!

745
01:20:21,067 --> 01:20:25,947
Queen of Inferno, Sheba.
A fitting match for him!

746
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:30,409
<i>Here we go! Okay .</i>

747
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:24,589
Transform the world...

748
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:29,135
There's still time. Open your eyes, Cereza.

749
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:33,556
Father? You don't learn, do you?

750
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:37,059
Mama was trying to save you.

751
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,604
Such nonsense.

752
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:45,526
The Creation of a
New World will bring true salvation.

753
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,945
You're such an egoist.

754
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:53,409
What's the fun in creating a
world where you get your own way?

755
01:21:53,618 --> 01:21:56,704
I rather like this chaos.

756
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:12,637
You struggle in vain!

757
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,351
No, you struggle in vain.

758
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:36,702
Got it.

759
01:22:36,911 --> 01:22:39,664
Let's finish it off.

760
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:54,095
I'll feed you all the magic powers.

761
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:08,150
Now, understand Mama's feelings.

762
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:11,320
Daughter...

763
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:16,951
this lowly world tore Rosa and I apart.

764
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:21,622
The world must return to its proper state!

765
01:23:21,831 --> 01:23:24,250
It must be!

766
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:26,585
A pointless wish.

767
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:29,547
Mama's waiting.

768
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:35,261
<i>Bye... Daddy!</i>

769
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:52,528
I love you, Balder.

770
01:23:54,905 --> 01:23:56,490
Rosa”.

771
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:05,166
Farewell to the last sage.

772
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:16,719
Rosa”.

773
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:55,925
<i>Bayonetta...</i>

774
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:11,232
<i>It's been a year since
Bayonetta disappeared.</i>

775
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:16,570
I've got all this funeral work
and she's not around to help.

776
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:20,324
My business is over.

777
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:25,412
Hey, Rodin. Do you think
she's gone for good?

778
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:31,502
Who's to know? I just help out
people who are looking for weapons.

779
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,254
That's all.

780
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:35,589
If you say so.

781
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:50,229
Father... sorry it took so long.

782
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:56,777
Although I may have
published it, it's not selling.

783
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:04,285
Wonder where she went?

784
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:11,250
But we'll meet again, won't we, Bayonetta?

785
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:22,845
They're tenacious.

786
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:26,682
I should go before the
church becomes a pile of corpses.

787
01:26:26,891 --> 01:26:29,351
Isn't it ironic that you're a nun!

788
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,188
It is not as bad as you think.

789
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:34,315
You should try it yourself.

790
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:38,277
Teaching in high school suits me just fine.

791
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:40,863
But before I go home...

792
01:26:41,572 --> 01:26:45,910
We've got to teach those bad boys a lesson.

793
01:26:55,294 --> 01:26:57,588
Let's dance, baby!!
