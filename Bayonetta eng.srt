1
00:00:02,421 --> 00:00:06,550
A long time ago, in a remote part
of Europe, in a place called "Vigrid"...

2
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:11,013
lived those who were known
as the observers of history.

3
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:14,391
The Umbra Witches, the
followers of darkness.

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,478
And the Lumen Sages, the
followers of the light.

5
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:23,108
The witches were in league with demons
and the sages were allied with angels...

6
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:25,610
they were responsible
for protecting the world...

7
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:29,531
by keeping the right
balance between them.

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,993
However, the balance was lost suddenly.

9
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:37,873
It started because a sage and a witch
violated the decrees that bound them...

10
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:42,294
and produced a child.

11
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:46,381
The woman was imprisoned
and the man was banished...

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,926
but that was only the beginning.

13
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:55,348
"The intersection of light and
dark will bring calamity to this earth."

14
00:00:55,557 --> 00:01:01,271
That legend had become reality.

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,903
Right Eye and Left Eye
govern the power of creation.

16
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:11,421
The forbidden child,
who the witches took

17
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,993
charge of, possessed the
powers of Left Eye.

18
00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:17,245
When the two eyes are brought together...

19
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:23,001
the Creator Jubileus will be made
incarnate and a New World will be created.

20
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,131
This is heaven's will and heaven's order.

21
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,428
The sages were on heaven's side,
the witches were against them...

22
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:39,601
resulting in a conflict over Left Eye.

23
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,097
The conflict grew and
grew until it became a

24
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:44,356
full-blown war between
angels and demons...

25
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:48,026
and the world was sent
hurtling towards destruction.

26
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:54,282
The sages and the witches died out
in droves, and the war came to an end.

27
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:59,663
The truth of their existences
slipped into obscurity.

28
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:02,541
The forbidden child grew
up to be a witch...

29
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:08,296
but she was hidden away
and sealed in a secret place...

30
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:11,925
500 years later...

31
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:16,680
The witch, who hunts
angels, has returned...

32
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:36,700
"Mass suicide in Ragna church."

33
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:11,776
Fleur de Cirey...

34
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:32,088
I am the way into the city of woe.

35
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:34,883
I am the way to a forsaken people.

36
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:37,719
I am the way into eternal sorrow.

37
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:41,640
Abandon all hope ye who enter here.

38
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:44,434
I am the way into the city of woe.

39
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:47,395
I am the way to a forsaken people.

40
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:50,774
I am the way into eternal sorrow.

41
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:54,945
Abandon all hope ye who enter here.

42
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:06,122
What's going on?

43
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:42,635
This time, I'll reveal her
for who she really is.

44
00:05:56,983 --> 00:06:02,447
Look what you've done to
my outfit. You're so impatient.

45
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:35,814
You presume too much.
I'm not the partner you seek.

46
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,403
It was a wonderful performance, Rodin.

47
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:43,988
But of course, Bayonetta.

48
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:47,909
By the way... is my Knight ready?

49
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:52,455
Whether you'll like him
or not is another thing.

50
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:06,177
The Elfin Knight.

51
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:09,139
It is a good name for a knight's weapon.

52
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:25,613
The fun's only just started.

53
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,734
What's going on?

54
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,221
Beautiful!

55
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,278
MY Car!

56
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:53,576
I'm still paying the loan.

57
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:16,474
This is bad!

58
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:25,108
I must become the cornerstone of Left Eye.

59
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:29,862
Unleash all your powers of darkness.

60
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:32,282
What are you talking about?

61
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:47,755
The Creator will soon return.

62
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:50,675
You're wasting your time.

63
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:59,100
What's going on here?

64
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:32,258
My infernal partner is
telling me he's hungry!

65
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:38,640
He'd be quite satisfied
with a catch like you.

66
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:54,447
It's dinnertime, my sweet.

67
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:06,084
Oh, I forgot. There's another
reason why I'm hunting you.

68
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:10,880
I take pleasure from watching
your face distort with pain.

69
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:14,926
Transform the world into
what it should be...

70
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,513
That's the face I was talking about.

71
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,640
It gets me so excited!!

72
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:25,687
Glory be to the Creator Jubileus!

73
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:46,791
You put on quite a show.

74
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:53,172
Did you like the Knight?

75
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,429
Not bad.

76
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:03,224
It'll do as a sidekick for a while.

77
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,145
Time to open the bar.

78
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,857
I'll be waiting.

79
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:13,276
If I can be bothered.

80
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:19,532
I'll prepare Mysterious
Destiny with an olive.

81
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,923
I thought it was a mouse.
But it was you, Cheshire.

82
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:40,511
The name's Luka. It's about
time you remembered.

83
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,472
What is it?

84
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:46,642
Guys who stalk the ladies
never get the girl.

85
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:50,021
I wouldn't worry. I've got the looks.

86
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:55,485
Claire, Trish, Sylvia, and
Ammy are all crazy about me.

87
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:58,946
I'm impressed you have so many friends.

88
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:02,950
But it's not nice to be a peeping Tom.

89
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,702
Such a bad boy.

90
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:09,415
Stop it! That's professional equipment.

91
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:14,670
Not to mention, you made
a huge dent in my car!

92
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,215
Did I?

93
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:23,554
Did it conveniently slip your mind again?

94
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:30,937
I'll never forget what
happened 20 years ago.

95
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:32,897
Fleur de Cirey.

96
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:36,776
I'll always remember the smell.

97
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:45,243
The same smell from the day
my father died... the day I first saw you.

98
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,095
Father!

99
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,223
Father”.

100
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,976
As a journalist...

101
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,646
I'll expose you for who you are.

102
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,565
That's a turn on.

103
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,108
Remember this.

104
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:20,862
You can disappear,
but I'll know you by your scent.

105
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,365
The famous perfume, Fleur de Cirey.

106
00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:28,452
The sweet essence of rosemary.

107
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,788
It doesn't suit you.

108
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:34,417
You don't know that much
about perfume do you, Cheshire?

109
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,710
My name's Luka!

110
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:39,797
Rosemary isn't used in Fleur de Cirey.

111
00:14:40,006 --> 00:14:42,133
I wear it to ward off evil spirits.

112
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:46,971
A witch with a perfume to
ward off evil? That's a laugh.

113
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,015
They heard the commotion.

114
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,434
See you, Cheshire.

115
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,811
Bayonetta, wait!

116
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:57,398
This isn't good.

117
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:02,403
The reawakening is close.

118
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,657
Good girl.

119
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:53,496
There are demons in places like this.
You should go somewhere safer.

120
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:09,929
I am here in front of the
lthavoll Tower, in Vigrid...

121
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,264
a sacred site of the Ragna.

122
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:15,279
This year, the 500-year
wait for the return of

123
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,229
the Creator Jubileus is
meant to come to an end.

124
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:23,484
Believers all around the world
are joyously celebrating his coming.

125
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:26,874
Meanwhile, however, we
continue to hear of believers

126
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,657
committing suicide "to
aid the resurrection."

127
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,118
Only yesterday a head
priest of the Ragna...

128
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:36,122
committed suicide
with over 20 believers.

129
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:42,169
Unknown parties later partially destroyed
the cathedral housing their bodies.

130
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:46,507
This has prompted many countries
to pronounce states of emergency...

131
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:50,720
and believers of Ragna
have been asked to remain calm.

132
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:55,057
The supreme leader of the lthavoll Group,
who effectively governs this sacred city...

133
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:58,561
is preparing to appear
in public for the first time.

134
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,272
The humans are panicking.

135
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,773
It's pathetic!

136
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:07,069
Sacrificing themselves for
the resurrection of some god?

137
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:12,742
But it's thanks to these
idiots that I'm in business.

138
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,038
You're overcharging for
the funerals you're taking on.

139
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,957
You're not such a good guy, either.

140
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:24,670
I'm a good guy. As long
as I'm making money!

141
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:31,052
Anyone with a conscience wouldn't
want to handle these crazy believers.

142
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,432
When you look at it,
I'm quite the philanthropist.

143
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,436
If that's the case,
you should be donating to the Church.

144
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:44,315
And you owe me my reward.

145
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:48,360
Don't make me laugh. You
enjoy killing angels.

146
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,907
You take pleasure in it, right?
Isn't that enough?

147
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:56,202
Hey, wait. Slow down.

148
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,536
I'm sorry?

149
00:17:57,745 --> 00:18:03,042
Shit!! You're the one
that trashed the cathedral.

150
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,421
So I say goodbye to any profit.
Consider my position!

151
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,965
I offer my condolences.

152
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:14,261
But the deal was information in
exchange for a troublesome funeral.

153
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,180
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:22,144
You're damn bossy for someone
who can't even remember her own name.

155
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:25,064
Her name is Bayonetta.

156
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:28,526
That's the name you gave her.

157
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:32,530
It's been 20 years since she awoke
from her coffin at the bottom of that lake.

158
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:37,868
But she's still one big mystery... the only
thing she remembers is that she's a witch.

159
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:41,956
Killing angels and offering
them up to demons is great and all,

160
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:45,626
but she might as well do work
more likely to make some money...

161
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:49,088
Men who blabber lead short lives.

162
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:56,095
And here he is. Mr. Balder,
the leader of the lthavoll Group.

163
00:18:56,303 --> 00:19:02,768
It's fair to say that the Group's vast
fortune supports the economy of Vigrid.

164
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:06,856
If Mr. Balder, revered by
his followers, tackles this well...

165
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,024
Oh, that's him!

166
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:12,987
I'll give you the lowdown
on him as your reward.

167
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,115
He's the head of the Ragna.

168
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,910
Apparently, it's the first time
he's shown his face in public.

169
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:24,206
This coincides with the
first resurrection in 500 years.

170
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:28,836
Some say he has been alive
since the last resurrection.

171
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,672
If that's the truth, he's not human.

172
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:36,468
The lthavoll Group has cutting-edge
technology that ain't exactly in keeping

173
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,054
with the "good old religious hub" image.

174
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:42,641
The believers see technology
as a holy miracle.

175
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:50,850
According to informants, Balder is
a descendent of the long lost sages...

176
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,613
the votaries of light and enemy
of the witches spoken of in folklore.

177
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:59,575
A modern day sage...

178
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:03,370
A tasty snippet of info, right?

179
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:14,506
I'm waiting, my dear child.

180
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:21,555
She seems happy with the reward.

181
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:24,600
I am going home.

182
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:28,270
My sons are going to throw
me a birthday party.

183
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:30,940
Not paying for your drinks again?

184
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:36,403
That's your birthday present, right?
Thank you.

185
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:40,658
I'll contact you when I get a job.

186
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:44,203
Freaky undertaker.

187
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,538
Ciao!

188
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:00,094
You were holding that when you awoke.

189
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,387
Yes.

190
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,807
It doesn't help you to remember?

191
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,017
Well...

192
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:13,190
At the moment, that man,
Balder, interests me more.

193
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:18,237
He holds the key to my lost memory.

194
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:22,741
Is that what Enzo's info told you?

195
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:28,414
Call it woman's intuition.

196
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,666
So you're going to Vigrid?

197
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,584
Yes.

198
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:43,804
Take whatever you want.

199
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:07,202
I've waited 500 years
for this time to come.

200
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:11,040
The girl will find her way here in the end.

201
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:16,503
And will history repeat itself? Or...

202
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:21,050
Her path is predestined.
And I'll tell you why.

203
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:27,681
I understand the rules of
the three worlds. I see it all.

204
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,687
Our actions will help in the
reconstruction of the supreme world.

205
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:37,775
It's ironic that Right Eye
should choose chaos over order.

206
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:41,320
You're wrong. The world
is already in chaos.

207
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,531
My daughter and I must
become the Eyes of the World.

208
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,917
Until the three worlds
form a perfect whole,

209
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:51,330
there will be no true
order, no true salvation.

210
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,707
The logic of a madman.

211
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:57,002
You don't have the capacity to understand.

212
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:00,881
How unfortunate that you
cannot part with me.

213
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:05,552
The angels are working hard for me.

214
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:09,765
You too, Jeanne.

215
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:14,103
We've waited 500 years.

216
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:18,649
You must be looking forward
to seeing her again.

217
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:24,363
Everything we do is to prepare for
the coming of the Creator, Jubileus.

218
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:30,869
The Creation of a New World draws close.

219
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:47,678
The data's intact...

220
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:53,308
Yet I still couldn't capture her true form.

221
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:58,021
Where will I find you next, Bayonetta?

222
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:09,074
Ragna... the descendent of the sages...

223
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:19,543
When my father tried to uncover
the truth about the sages and witches...

224
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,588
Bayonetta killed him.

225
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:50,824
Awaken, dear daughter!

226
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,289
Daddy?

227
00:24:57,498 --> 00:25:01,043
Yes... come here.

228
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:53,762
Excuse me, but who are you?

229
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:16,201
You possess the same magic powers as me.

230
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:20,080
I'm going to ask you again. Who are you?

231
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:25,544
Your extended sleep seems
to have dulled your senses.

232
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:31,466
Have I met you before?
You seem to know who I am.

233
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:35,053
I may know that better than you do.

234
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,306
I'm even more curious.

235
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:41,310
If you can defeat me, I'll explain.

236
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,614
The fun's just begun.

237
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:18,096
I remember this. What about you?

238
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:19,890
Thanks for your concern.

239
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:23,977
I get the feeling I'll remember
once I've knocked you down.

240
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:26,104
You're so slow.

241
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:14,361
Is that all you have?

242
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:19,491
I don't know. I think I have a
few other tricks up my sleeve.

243
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,203
What else can you do with that toy?

244
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:26,998
I'll show you. You still
want to play, right?

245
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,212
You must be kidding...

246
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:35,090
We're not getting anywhere.

247
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:23,180
Hey, Daddy. Is Mummy here?

248
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:29,394
If you're a good girl,
Mummy will come for you very soon.

249
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:31,688
Cereza's a good girl!

250
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:34,900
You can wait on your own?

251
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,359
Of course!

252
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:51,374
Cheshire. It's okay, right?

253
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:55,337
Please come quickly, Mummy.

254
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:25,659
I don't recall this bar being here.

255
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:28,036
It's a temporary outpost.

256
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:31,957
Isn't there something you want to tell me?

257
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:36,837
They sure didn't live up to
the "Knight" name, did they?

258
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,756
What did you do to them?

259
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:43,844
All I did was have a
shootout with some bitch.

260
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:47,889
You were shooting at yourself?

261
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,560
I'll repair them.

262
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:54,938
Make them a little tougher next time.

263
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,442
Fancy a drink?

264
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:06,366
I'm in a hurry. I look forward
to a more satisfactory Knight.

265
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:26,553
Mummy, where are you?

266
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:29,347
Mummy...

267
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:45,280
Rodin's not the only one
who wants me to take a detour.

268
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:48,074
Where am I exactly?

269
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:51,995
It's no party spot.

270
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:56,291
Mummy! Mummy!

271
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:02,797
Mummy?

272
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,133
Mummy!

273
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:08,386
Mummy! Mummy!

274
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,724
A ghost!

275
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,310
Can you see angels?

276
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:26,863
Mummy! Mummy!

277
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:30,283
This is troublesome!

278
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:54,975
You want to play, huh? Let me oblige.

279
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,790
Cheshire! Cheshire!

280
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:20,625
Cheshire?

281
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:32,887
Mummy!

282
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,181
Stop crying-

283
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,852
I hate crybabies as much
as I hate cockroaches.

284
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,230
And I'm not your mother!

285
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:43,606
Okay.

286
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,692
Mummy...

287
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,572
You take cover, little one.

288
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,284
An angel seeks my attention.

289
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:59,164
But it doesn't seem to
want to harm this little girl.

290
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:04,836
Tell me why you went to
the trouble of bringing me here.

291
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,255
We're going to be safe, right?

292
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:11,301
I must become the cornerstone
of resurrection.

293
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:13,845
Come on. Let's dance!

294
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:22,979
I'm going to enjoy this.

295
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:43,249
Mummy!

296
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,220
You find me that engaging?

297
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:58,348
You want to take me by force?

298
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:00,558
Bad boy!

299
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:04,979
It seems I'll have to teach you a lesson!

300
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:22,122
Come on, then. Let's dance, baby!!

301
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:27,460
Glory be to the Creator Jubileus!

302
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:54,154
Mummy! Mummy!

303
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:58,158
What's your name, little one?

304
00:35:58,366 --> 00:35:59,868
Cereza.

305
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:02,287
Have you forgotten, Mummy?

306
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:05,832
I probably won't remember
you later, either.

307
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,376
What are you doing in
such a dreadful place?

308
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:13,631
Daddy told me to wait here for Mummy.

309
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,675
He left you alone?

310
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:19,095
I'm not alone. Cheshire's here.

311
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,097
You were crying like a baby.

312
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:23,683
Mummy, let's go home.

313
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:28,313
How many times do I have
to tell you? I'm not your mother.

314
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:30,940
Your father will be back soon.

315
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:34,611
But I want to stay with you, Mummy.

316
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:38,740
This is awkward.

317
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,666
Come here.

318
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:52,045
Okay. Mummy!

319
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:54,255
Ouch!

320
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:59,636
You're very clumsy.

321
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:26,120
What is it, Mummy?

322
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:28,248
Little one, what's this?

323
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:32,710
You gave it to me for my birthday, Mummy.

324
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:37,924
No more falling over.

325
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:39,634
Okay!

326
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:43,972
Hold on tight!

327
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,431
Okay. Mummy!

328
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,683
And no more "Mummy."

329
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:49,102
Okay. Mummy!

330
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:28,224
It's been forever since we
took a bath together! This is fun!

331
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,726
Honestly!

332
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:33,187
You nagged me into it.

333
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:42,822
You don't live with your mother?

334
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:48,202
You know I don't. I've
lived on my own for ages.

335
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,371
Your mother hates crybabies, too.

336
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,166
But I'm not a crybaby!

337
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:56,669
Mummy! Why didn't you come to see me?

338
00:38:56,878 --> 00:38:59,047
Why did you leave me alone?

339
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,257
I don't know.

340
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:04,719
Because I'm not your mother.

341
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:07,138
I hate you!

342
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,227
You were all alone?

343
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:15,688
Any friends?

344
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:17,357
Cheshire.

345
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:33,956
It's so pretty! Just like snow!

346
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:37,043
What a pushover...

347
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:46,886
I don't recall asking for room service.

348
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:50,765
You should think about your methods.
Someone could sue.

349
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,477
Not so many methods to
choose from with a witch.

350
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:56,145
Oh!

351
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:59,690
Who is he?

352
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,567
Cheshire... No.

353
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:05,571
He's a perverted old guy
who photographs ladies.

354
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,948
Pervert?

355
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,241
Mummy?

356
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:10,910
You have a daughter?

357
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,579
Of course not.

358
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:17,708
But the process of making
a baby interests me.

359
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:22,171
Well, I'm not interested...

360
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,925
Not interested... at all...

361
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:31,180
Not... interested... at all!

362
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:33,766
Oh! He fell!

363
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:35,935
Is the old guy dead?

364
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:39,856
No ghost is coming to
fetch him, so he must be alive.

365
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:41,983
Unfortunately.

366
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:48,030
I'm not an old guy.

367
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:19,061
Asleep already?

368
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,063
You're very persistent.

369
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:25,651
How much longer do you intend to hang
around with that toy of yours, Cheshire?

370
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,403
The name's Luka.

371
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:37,413
Bayonetta, what's happening in this city?

372
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:38,873
I don't care.

373
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:41,542
Why are you here, then?

374
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:43,586
It's none of your business.

375
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:48,674
It's everything to do with me...
you killed my father.

376
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:51,719
I've heard enough of that assumption.

377
00:41:51,928 --> 00:41:54,180
Don't play innocent with me.

378
00:41:54,388 --> 00:41:56,307
My father was a journalist...

379
00:41:56,516 --> 00:42:03,314
who devoted his life to solving
the mystery of the sages and the witches.

380
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:10,238
Though he probably never
dreamed he'd be killed by a witch...

381
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:15,785
By revealing your identity,
perhaps I can uncover the truth he sought.

382
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:20,081
According to his notes,
about 500 years ago...

383
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:24,085
the sages and the witches
suddenly disappeared...

384
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:27,129
and their legend was lost.

385
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:31,509
However, the witch, Bayonetta,
reappeared 20 years ago.

386
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:35,513
And now a descendent of the sages,
Balder, has come forward.

387
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:39,767
It must have something
to do with the resurrection.

388
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:42,019
You're going to see Balder, right?

389
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:44,897
Possibly...

390
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:50,194
You'll understand why you killed
my father when you regain your memory.

391
00:42:50,403 --> 00:42:53,364
And what happened that day...

392
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,283
Mummy!

393
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:58,494
Mummy! Where did you go?

394
00:42:58,703 --> 00:43:00,288
Little one.

395
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:04,750
I'm busy babysitting.
I wish you could take over.

396
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:06,794
Well, that's a good idea.

397
00:43:07,003 --> 00:43:09,589
Mummy!

398
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:14,010
Mummy. Where did you go? I was lonely.

399
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:17,597
If you cry for one more second,
I won't sleep with you.

400
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:21,642
You'll never leave me again, right?

401
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,590
What's up, little girl?

402
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:57,094
I'm a... I'm a crybaby.

403
00:43:57,303 --> 00:44:00,514
So my mummy left me.

404
00:44:00,723 --> 00:44:02,767
Bayonetta's gone?

405
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,268
She didn't!

406
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:07,980
She was serious about me babysitting you?!

407
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:11,776
Let's go look for your Mummy together.

408
00:44:11,984 --> 00:44:14,695
Yes, old guy.

409
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,908
Listen, I'm not old, okay?

410
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:20,910
Yes, old guy.

411
00:44:22,203 --> 00:44:24,413
Let's get 90309-

412
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:32,463
The two eyes that govern the
world are about to be reunited.

413
00:44:32,672 --> 00:44:40,012
With the resurrection of the Creator
Jubileus at hand, the angels are restless.

414
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:44,100
You will be sacrificed in
order to awaken Left Eye.

415
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:47,603
We are in consensus...

416
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:52,233
All of this is to fulfill our goal.

417
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:57,947
For the Creation of a New World!

418
00:45:22,263 --> 00:45:24,348
That's a nice car.

419
00:45:24,557 --> 00:45:27,768
It is a pity it'll end up in the scrapyard.

420
00:45:37,611 --> 00:45:39,405
What is it?

421
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:42,616
What? Something's coming this way?

422
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,369
Can you see something?

423
00:45:45,578 --> 00:45:46,871
No.

424
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,039
They piss me off.

425
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:36,170
She put on quite a show.

426
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:41,133
Your mummy is easy to follow.

427
00:46:41,342 --> 00:46:43,052
Yes!

428
00:46:56,941 --> 00:47:02,238
You've had enough fun. It's my turn now.

429
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:17,419
Mmmm.

430
00:47:17,628 --> 00:47:21,423
Ask me out with a nicer car next time.

431
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:36,105
Not again... this is taking its toll on me.

432
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:41,986
May my soul reside with
the Creator, Jubileus.

433
00:47:42,695 --> 00:47:46,073
Old guy. We haven't caught up
with Mummy yet, right?

434
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:48,909
Nearly there. Be patient.

435
00:47:49,118 --> 00:47:50,119
Okay.

436
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:55,249
Once we see the airport, we'll be close
to the island with the lthavoll Tower.

437
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:57,209
We'll find your mother.

438
00:47:57,418 --> 00:47:59,253
Reafly?

439
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:01,213
Yeah.

440
00:48:01,422 --> 00:48:07,386
As long as the airport itself is intact.

441
00:48:07,595 --> 00:48:08,637
Here's the exit.

442
00:48:08,846 --> 00:48:10,556
Wow!

443
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:17,938
What's going on?

444
00:48:18,147 --> 00:48:21,483
This is overdoing it,
even by Bayonetta's standards!

445
00:48:21,692 --> 00:48:24,486
That ghost is big!

446
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:27,156
Mummy!

447
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:38,959
Retreat! Retreat!

448
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:11,825
The more I hunt angels,
the more powerful I feel.

449
00:49:12,034 --> 00:49:14,703
What a turn on!

450
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:34,890
It suits you!

451
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:58,247
Damn Bayonetta! If I can't find
transport we're going to be in trouble.

452
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:02,459
We're going to escape in that, little girl.

453
00:50:02,668 --> 00:50:03,668
Wait!

454
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:04,920
What is it?

455
00:50:05,129 --> 00:50:06,129
Put me down.

456
00:50:06,255 --> 00:50:08,257
You'll get burned.

457
00:50:09,508 --> 00:50:10,634
Did you see Mummy?

458
00:50:10,843 --> 00:50:12,344
Ghosts.

459
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:14,805
Ghosts?

460
00:50:15,014 --> 00:50:18,100
Ghosts are coming!!

461
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:21,729
Don't be silly. I can't see a thing.

462
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:25,566
I smell rosemary.

463
00:50:25,774 --> 00:50:27,609
Old guy?

464
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:33,032
Little girl, your older
brother's eyesight is good.

465
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,908
It's time to go.

466
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:36,910
Put these on!

467
00:50:38,328 --> 00:50:39,913
Very well.

468
00:50:47,046 --> 00:50:50,132
What are they? Could they be angels?

469
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:56,346
Little girl, is this really happening?

470
00:50:56,555 --> 00:50:58,140
Whoa!

471
00:51:00,893 --> 00:51:03,520
Hey, are they really angels?

472
00:51:03,729 --> 00:51:06,857
They look like monsters.

473
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:26,835
You actually chased me here?

474
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:32,508
You must be mad.

475
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:34,510
Mummy!

476
00:51:45,354 --> 00:51:48,190
Is that an angel, too?

477
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:49,398
Mummy!

478
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:51,777
She'll be fine!

479
00:52:11,672 --> 00:52:16,051
Little girl, is your
mother fighting the monsters?

480
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,721
Mummy's a witch.
She's strong and protects others.

481
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:22,307
A witch... who protects others?

482
00:52:22,516 --> 00:52:24,351
Yeah, of course!

483
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:29,898
I'm going to become a
strong witch to protect Mummy.

484
00:52:52,963 --> 00:52:57,092
Now, how pretty will the explosion be?

485
00:53:17,279 --> 00:53:21,408
Great! Mummy beat the ghosts!

486
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,077
Take these back.

487
00:53:24,286 --> 00:53:25,579
What?

488
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,291
Are they magic glasses?

489
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:30,499
No.

490
00:53:30,626 --> 00:53:33,587
You can see ghosts
without glasses, you know.

491
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:46,683
Angels? But I can still smell her.

492
00:53:52,689 --> 00:53:54,524
Mummy!

493
00:53:57,152 --> 00:54:00,155
Little one... are you crying?

494
00:54:00,364 --> 00:54:01,782
No, I'm not!

495
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,659
Good.

496
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:08,538
I wanted you to babysit her at home.

497
00:54:08,747 --> 00:54:10,290
Luka.

498
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:13,043
How many times have I told you?

499
00:54:13,252 --> 00:54:17,130
I'm not Luka. I'm Cheshire!

500
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:20,467
Will you stop taking the piss?

501
00:54:21,468 --> 00:54:23,053
This is Cheshire.

502
00:54:23,262 --> 00:54:24,972
What?

503
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:35,774
Will you take us to the
lthavoll Tower? Cheshire...

504
00:54:38,902 --> 00:54:43,532
You're in luck. That's just
where this helicopter is headed.

505
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,369
I'm seeing this through to the end.

506
00:54:50,539 --> 00:54:53,166
The Umbra witch...

507
00:54:53,375 --> 00:55:01,091
possesses the outstanding
power the sage spoke of.

508
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:06,555
The two eyes of darkness and light...

509
00:55:06,763 --> 00:55:10,475
that observed this world for many years.

510
00:55:10,684 --> 00:55:14,604
The Creation of a New World is here.

511
00:55:14,813 --> 00:55:20,360
Umbra witch, receive the
blessings of Jubileus.

512
00:55:27,576 --> 00:55:28,869
Here we are!!

513
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:36,752
It's good to see you, my dear.

514
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,755
The hardship is nearly over.

515
00:55:39,963 --> 00:55:46,136
The signpost to your
lost memory is waiting.

516
00:55:46,345 --> 00:55:52,476
Give me everything you've got.
Everything...

517
00:56:12,371 --> 00:56:13,705
Damn!

518
00:56:18,668 --> 00:56:20,587
It's on our tail!

519
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:27,761
Oh! We're safe?

520
00:56:28,512 --> 00:56:29,888
Where's Bayonetta?

521
00:56:43,026 --> 00:56:46,822
You're late. I've been waiting.

522
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:51,618
I hope you're going to
entertain me this time.

523
00:56:52,202 --> 00:56:54,246
You'll find out soon.

524
00:56:54,454 --> 00:57:00,043
This time, I'll make you
spill everything you know.

525
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,923
Do your best... if you can.

526
00:57:20,313 --> 00:57:22,913
Isn't it a shame that you have
to fight with such a crappy weapon!

527
00:57:36,288 --> 00:57:38,999
I can still sense your fear.

528
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:40,750
Fear?

529
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:43,378
Your memory will make things clear.

530
00:57:43,587 --> 00:57:48,133
You instinctively fear
the fate that you bear.

531
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:54,431
"The intersection of light and
dark would bring calamity to this earth."

532
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:56,683
It's an ancient saying.

533
00:57:56,892 --> 00:58:01,688
The calamity resulted in the
downfall of the witches and the sages.

534
00:58:01,897 --> 00:58:04,691
The effects can be felt even now...

535
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,404
centered around you,
the forbidden child.

536
00:58:09,613 --> 00:58:15,327
Put simply, the Creator's power
is known as the Eyes of the World.

537
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:21,374
You possess half of the power...
the power of Left Eye.

538
00:58:26,922 --> 00:58:28,673
Intruder...

539
00:58:36,515 --> 00:58:37,599
Where am I?

540
00:58:37,807 --> 00:58:40,352
I've been waiting, Left Eye.

541
00:58:42,312 --> 00:58:43,813
Witch Jeanne...

542
00:58:44,022 --> 00:58:48,693
Hindering the coming of the
Creator Jubileus will not be permitted.

543
00:58:48,902 --> 00:58:53,281
You think an angel has the
right to order a witch around?

544
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:55,617
Beat it.

545
00:58:58,745 --> 00:59:01,289
Foolish one.

546
00:59:01,498 --> 00:59:06,628
Left Eye, I'll be waiting
by the side of my Lord.

547
00:59:20,058 --> 00:59:23,144
Well, this looks like a fun place!

548
00:59:23,353 --> 00:59:26,356
More entertaining than your bar.

549
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:36,032
How many times do I have to say?
I'm not who you're looking for.

550
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:49,588
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Here are your guns.

551
00:59:51,214 --> 00:59:54,593
I hope they'll satisfy me this time.

552
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:56,970
And more to boot.

553
01:00:05,103 --> 01:00:09,316
Scarborough Fair. Your new Knight.

554
01:00:09,524 --> 01:00:12,110
It's had a radical transformation.

555
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:28,627
See you in the bar.

556
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:31,921
If I ever miss the boredom...

557
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:36,343
We seem to be on an equal footing now.

558
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:40,388
That's right. I'll try
to be gentle with you.

559
01:00:40,597 --> 01:00:47,062
Let's be clear, if you lose to me,
that girl of yours will disappear.

560
01:01:04,746 --> 01:01:06,915
That's it! That's the idea!

561
01:01:07,374 --> 01:01:09,000
I remember...

562
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:15,507
Jeanne, in accordance with witch law,

563
01:01:15,715 --> 01:01:19,260
we will now test your worthiness
to be one of our greatest warriors.

564
01:01:19,886 --> 01:01:22,347
Choose an opponent.

565
01:01:23,056 --> 01:01:24,974
I'll take the outcast.

566
01:01:26,518 --> 01:01:27,936
That is not permitted!

567
01:01:28,144 --> 01:01:33,400
It is not allowed to engage with
the one cursed with tainted blood.

568
01:01:38,071 --> 01:01:42,117
I remember... I've been here before.

569
01:01:43,952 --> 01:01:47,247
At last! Let the memories return!

570
01:01:53,545 --> 01:01:56,589
Your memory... do you fear it?

571
01:02:24,951 --> 01:02:29,497
Can you feel your strength
increase as your memory returns?

572
01:02:29,706 --> 01:02:33,793
It is the mission of us
witches to protect Left Eye.

573
01:02:34,002 --> 01:02:37,797
Even if the forbidden child possesses it.

574
01:02:38,006 --> 01:02:40,049
Us witches?

575
01:03:33,561 --> 01:03:36,189
Mama. Mama.

576
01:03:44,197 --> 01:03:49,327
The Left Eye of the witches is ours now.

577
01:03:50,286 --> 01:03:52,372
Left Eye...

578
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:58,211
Let us seek out the Creator Jubileus.

579
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:03,383
The greatest treasure of
my clan, "Left Eye"...

580
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:05,885
I will not hand it over!

581
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:29,367
Jeanne, you saved me.

582
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:42,422
When you lost your mother,
you also lost the will to fight.

583
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:46,885
It was the only thing
I could do to protect Left Eye.

584
01:04:48,678 --> 01:04:52,515
We were lucky to have had
an innocent childhood.

585
01:04:52,724 --> 01:04:54,976
Yes...

586
01:04:56,311 --> 01:05:00,648
You were my only friend...

587
01:05:02,734 --> 01:05:06,237
And that silly doll of yours.

588
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:10,783
Jeanne...

589
01:05:10,992 --> 01:05:15,872
500 years ago... why did you choose me?

590
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,167
Everyone hated me.

591
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:25,465
To become one of the most powerful witches,
I had to defeat the strongest opponent.

592
01:05:25,673 --> 01:05:27,383
That's all.

593
01:05:28,468 --> 01:05:32,263
You cannot run from the sage Balder.

594
01:05:32,472 --> 01:05:35,308
Bring an end to it all.

595
01:05:35,516 --> 01:05:38,895
That's your destiny.

596
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:43,733
Fight, win and create a new path.

597
01:05:43,942 --> 01:05:46,861
You can do it!

598
01:05:53,868 --> 01:05:55,370
Jeanne!

599
01:06:06,089 --> 01:06:07,340
Jeanne.

600
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:11,344
Mummy!

601
01:06:13,096 --> 01:06:17,809
Got here without any fuss.
Seems like I'm a guest, too.

602
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:21,396
Mummy...?

603
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:26,150
Little one, what's your greatest treasure?

604
01:06:26,359 --> 01:06:27,652
Cheshire?

605
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,611
No.

606
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,655
Cheshire's a friend.

607
01:06:32,365 --> 01:06:34,617
This is my greatest treasure.

608
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:42,625
You should never let a treasure go.

609
01:06:42,834 --> 01:06:45,545
Whatever happens.

610
01:06:45,753 --> 01:06:48,548
I know! I won't cry any more.

611
01:06:48,756 --> 01:06:53,177
I want to be like you.
You never run away from anything!

612
01:06:53,386 --> 01:06:55,304
I'm gonna try hard.

613
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:04,272
You're not going on your own?

614
01:07:05,606 --> 01:07:07,817
You'll tag along anyway, right?

615
01:07:08,026 --> 01:07:09,902
Right?

616
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:29,589
It's as if we're being asked inside.
That's very generous.

617
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:32,550
My darling daughter...

618
01:07:32,759 --> 01:07:36,888
It's time to open the "Eyes of the World."

619
01:07:37,096 --> 01:07:39,766
It's Daddy! Daddy's voice!

620
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:41,392
Wait!

621
01:07:41,601 --> 01:07:42,935
It's Daddy!

622
01:07:43,144 --> 01:07:44,562
This way!

623
01:07:44,771 --> 01:07:46,189
Little one...

624
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,950
Mummy! Mummy's here too, Daddy!

625
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:06,000
I've waited a long time
for this family reunion.

626
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,420
Save him...

627
01:08:11,214 --> 01:08:13,674
Did you have a good journey?

628
01:08:13,883 --> 01:08:17,303
Yes. Mummy's very strong!

629
01:08:17,512 --> 01:08:18,805
I see...

630
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:23,851
I was scared of the ghosts,
but Mummy told me not to cry.

631
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,312
You've grown strong, Cereza.

632
01:08:26,521 --> 01:08:27,897
Yes!

633
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:31,317
Today you must sleep in your own room.

634
01:08:31,526 --> 01:08:36,614
But I don't want to.
There's so much I want to tell you.

635
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:41,953
You can tell me tomorrow.

636
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:44,747
Oh... okay.

637
01:08:44,956 --> 01:08:46,916
Good girl.

638
01:08:49,335 --> 01:08:51,420
Sweet dreams!

639
01:08:51,629 --> 01:08:54,298
Yes... good night.

640
01:08:59,637 --> 01:09:01,180
Mummy...

641
01:09:01,973 --> 01:09:05,768
It's okay... I won't cry
anymore, even if I'm alone.

642
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:08,813
Clever girl.

643
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:11,232
Good night, Mummy.

644
01:09:16,904 --> 01:09:19,699
How did you bring me from the past?

645
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:22,702
The past... what?

646
01:09:23,536 --> 01:09:29,125
I opened the door of space-time distorted
by the influence of Jubileus's coming.

647
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:36,174
I wanted you to see this foolish
world through innocent, untainted eyes.

648
01:09:36,382 --> 01:09:39,177
So this man is...?

649
01:09:39,385 --> 01:09:42,305
The last surviving Lumen Sage.

650
01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:45,766
The cause of everything. And...

651
01:09:45,975 --> 01:09:50,605
little one's... no, my Daddy.

652
01:09:52,273 --> 01:09:56,569
I've been waiting 500 years...

653
01:09:57,278 --> 01:10:00,698
for a chance to purge
the chaotic worlds...

654
01:10:00,907 --> 01:10:03,743
of heaven, hell and the human world...

655
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:07,380
With the resurrection
of Jubileus, the three

656
01:10:07,392 --> 01:10:10,374
worlds will become
void and be reborn.

657
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:16,923
Cereza, you and I will
become gods of this new world!

658
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:22,428
Leave it to the leader
of the lthavoll Group.

659
01:10:22,637 --> 01:10:26,015
You're the master of blowing your own horn.

660
01:10:26,224 --> 01:10:29,810
But it's not enough to make the headlines.

661
01:10:30,019 --> 01:10:32,230
You're Luka, right?

662
01:10:32,438 --> 01:10:35,316
I've been watching your progress.

663
01:10:35,524 --> 01:10:39,403
Like your father,
you've become a great journalist.

664
01:10:39,612 --> 01:10:41,405
You knew my father?

665
01:10:41,614 --> 01:10:45,409
He did some good
investigative work on my plan...

666
01:10:45,618 --> 01:10:49,497
Everything was fine until
he found Cereza...

667
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:53,668
but he was a little too ambitious.

668
01:10:54,669 --> 01:10:56,379
Wh... What are you doing?

669
01:10:57,588 --> 01:10:59,548
The scent of rosemary...

670
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:03,094
That's the scent... I
remember from that day.

671
01:11:15,398 --> 01:11:18,693
I see it now... it was you...

672
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:20,194
Your angels killed my father...

673
01:11:20,403 --> 01:11:25,116
My condolences on your loss.

674
01:11:26,242 --> 01:11:30,788
Bayonetta, please forgive me.

675
01:11:31,414 --> 01:11:33,374
Never mind that.

676
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:40,548
Well, even that little crybaby
decided never to cry again.

677
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:45,219
So it's time for me to man up
and bring everything to an end!

678
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:51,934
Such crude methods for a journalist.

679
01:11:55,688 --> 01:11:56,772
Luka!

680
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:06,198
Cereza, the journey ends here.

681
01:12:06,949 --> 01:12:11,996
I don't understand.
Why did you summon the younger me?

682
01:12:12,204 --> 01:12:15,708
Why bother with such
convoluted plans to bring me here?

683
01:12:17,126 --> 01:12:21,047
You lost your memory completely...

684
01:12:21,255 --> 01:12:26,218
In order to open Left Eye, you must
reclaim your power, your experience,

685
01:12:26,427 --> 01:12:30,514
and your love.

686
01:12:31,223 --> 01:12:34,643
Not only did you try to
throw the world into chaos...

687
01:12:34,852 --> 01:12:38,689
but you killed Mama.
What do you know of love?

688
01:12:38,898 --> 01:12:41,984
It wasn't me who killed Rosa.

689
01:12:42,193 --> 01:12:44,862
The distortion of the world tore us apart.

690
01:12:45,071 --> 01:12:50,284
Angels anxious for the
resurrection killed her.

691
01:12:50,493 --> 01:12:57,124
The angels chose to fight you and became
sacrifices to enhance your magic powers.

692
01:12:57,333 --> 01:13:00,127
Jeanne was the final ingredient.

693
01:13:00,336 --> 01:13:05,424
She unleashed your full power
and regained the core of you.

694
01:13:05,633 --> 01:13:09,095
Your memory, in other words.

695
01:13:09,303 --> 01:13:12,848
Jeanne did very well.

696
01:13:17,353 --> 01:13:19,146
You're crazy.

697
01:13:19,647 --> 01:13:21,399
I beg to differ.

698
01:13:21,607 --> 01:13:26,654
It is not me who's crazy,
it's the world itself.

699
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:31,450
Can you really shoot me?

700
01:13:33,327 --> 01:13:35,830
You don't think I can?

701
01:13:36,038 --> 01:13:40,167
You're going to shoot me? Your father?

702
01:13:42,378 --> 01:13:47,675
My dearest daughter, Cereza.

703
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:02,898
Let's hail the dawning of
a new order and a new world.

704
01:14:44,523 --> 01:14:48,360
The rebirth of the Creator?
You must be kidding...

705
01:15:00,164 --> 01:15:06,795
Jubileus... walk with us!

706
01:15:15,179 --> 01:15:19,475
We must become one with Jubileus.

707
01:15:40,829 --> 01:15:44,833
The time has come at last.

708
01:15:45,376 --> 01:15:50,464
We will become the Creator of a New World.

709
01:16:06,814 --> 01:16:09,066
Don't tell me that's Jubileus?!

710
01:16:09,275 --> 01:16:10,901
Bayonetta!

711
01:16:18,951 --> 01:16:20,661
It's wonderful!

712
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:27,251
My daughter, this is the
beginning of the new world.

713
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:32,423
Cereza...

714
01:16:33,132 --> 01:16:34,550
Mama...?

715
01:16:35,884 --> 01:16:39,805
Please... save him...

716
01:16:40,014 --> 01:16:44,768
His soul is trapped in madness.

717
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:47,896
Save him...

718
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:56,196
Yes, Mama...

719
01:16:56,405 --> 01:17:01,493
I must do now what I couldn't then.

720
01:17:13,589 --> 01:17:17,259
Jeanne, you're still alive?

721
01:17:17,468 --> 01:17:22,014
"The intersection of light and
dark will bring calamity to this earth."

722
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:25,392
So it has another meaning.

723
01:17:25,601 --> 01:17:29,605
No,this is the real meaning!
You're too late...

724
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:34,568
You are not needed in this new world.

725
01:17:34,777 --> 01:17:36,654
I'm not?

726
01:17:43,827 --> 01:17:47,164
Return our greatest treasure to us!

727
01:17:58,592 --> 01:18:02,262
Jeanne... You must
open your eyes!

728
01:18:02,471 --> 01:18:06,016
Finish what started 500 years ago.

729
01:18:07,768 --> 01:18:11,021
No time to hesitate! Cereza!!

730
01:18:21,448 --> 01:18:24,702
I certainly need to keep my eye on you!

731
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:27,121
You're not dead yet?

732
01:18:44,263 --> 01:18:50,811
You fools... What
have you done?!

733
01:18:51,019 --> 01:18:54,481
What have you done?!

734
01:19:18,547 --> 01:19:20,299
A regular pet isn't good enough!

735
01:19:20,507 --> 01:19:22,509
It would appear so.

736
01:19:22,718 --> 01:19:26,138
My dear daughter, Cereza.

737
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:29,057
How dare you turn a sword on me?

738
01:19:29,266 --> 01:19:37,266
I won't have it!

739
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:42,613
This is celestial power, huh?

740
01:19:42,821 --> 01:19:45,741
Cereza, you must follow through.

741
01:19:45,949 --> 01:19:50,078
Of course... but we must do it together.

742
01:19:50,287 --> 01:19:51,288
What?

743
01:19:51,497 --> 01:19:53,791
I've got a special weapon.

744
01:19:57,085 --> 01:19:59,171
Sounds good to me!

745
01:20:20,067 --> 01:20:24,947
Queen of Inferno, Sheba.
A fitting match for him!

746
01:20:26,824 --> 01:20:29,409
Here we go! Okay .

747
01:21:20,335 --> 01:21:23,589
Transform the world...

748
01:21:23,797 --> 01:21:28,135
There's still time. Open your eyes, Cereza.

749
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:32,556
Father? You don't learn, do you?

750
01:21:32,764 --> 01:21:36,059
Mama was trying to save you.

751
01:21:36,476 --> 01:21:38,604
Such nonsense.

752
01:21:38,812 --> 01:21:44,526
The Creation of a
New World will bring true salvation.

753
01:21:44,735 --> 01:21:46,945
You're such an egoist.

754
01:21:47,154 --> 01:21:52,409
What's the fun in creating a
world where you get your own way?

755
01:21:52,618 --> 01:21:55,704
I rather like this chaos.

756
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:11,637
You struggle in vain!

757
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,351
No, you struggle in vain.

758
01:22:34,242 --> 01:22:35,702
Got it.

759
01:22:35,911 --> 01:22:38,664
Let's finish it off.

760
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:53,095
I'll feed you all the magic powers.

761
01:23:01,603 --> 01:23:07,150
Now, understand Mama's feelings.

762
01:23:08,777 --> 01:23:10,320
Daughter...

763
01:23:10,529 --> 01:23:15,951
this lowly world tore Rosa and I apart.

764
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:20,622
The world must return to its proper state!

765
01:23:20,831 --> 01:23:23,250
It must be!

766
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:25,585
A pointless wish.

767
01:23:26,503 --> 01:23:28,547
Mama's waiting.

768
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:34,261
Bye... Daddy!

769
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:51,528
I love you, Balder.

770
01:23:53,905 --> 01:23:55,490
Rosa”.

771
01:24:00,787 --> 01:24:04,166
Farewell to the last sage.

772
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:15,719
Rosa”.

773
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:54,925
Bayonetta...

774
01:25:06,895 --> 01:25:10,232
It's been a year since
Bayonetta disappeared.

775
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:15,570
I've got all this funeral work
and she's not around to help.

776
01:25:17,322 --> 01:25:19,324
My business is over.

777
01:25:19,533 --> 01:25:24,412
Hey, Rodin. Do you think
she's gone for good?

778
01:25:24,621 --> 01:25:30,502
Who's to know? I just help out
people who are looking for weapons.

779
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,254
That's all.

780
01:25:32,462 --> 01:25:34,589
If you say so.

781
01:25:45,475 --> 01:25:49,229
Father... sorry it took so long.

782
01:25:49,437 --> 01:25:55,777
Although I may have
published it, it's not selling.

783
01:25:59,739 --> 01:26:03,285
Wonder where she went?

784
01:26:06,872 --> 01:26:10,250
But we'll meet again, won't we, Bayonetta?

785
01:26:20,177 --> 01:26:21,845
They're tenacious.

786
01:26:22,053 --> 01:26:25,682
I should go before the
church becomes a pile of corpses.

787
01:26:25,891 --> 01:26:28,351
Isn't it ironic that you're a nun!

788
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,188
It is not as bad as you think.

789
01:26:31,396 --> 01:26:33,315
You should try it yourself.

790
01:26:33,523 --> 01:26:37,277
Teaching in high school suits me just fine.

791
01:26:37,485 --> 01:26:39,863
But before I go home...

792
01:26:40,572 --> 01:26:44,910
We've got to teach those bad boys a lesson.

793
01:26:54,294 --> 01:26:56,588
Let's dance, baby!!
