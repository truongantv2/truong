1
-00:02:16,760 --> -00:02:14,260
Well then, let's begin—

2
-00:02:14,260 --> -00:02:12,120
Pitiful boy.

3
-00:02:12,120 --> -00:02:09,560
Heart-Under-Blade's subordinate.

4
-00:02:09,130 --> -00:02:06,210
Wait, before that let's confirm the terms.

5
-00:02:05,300 --> -00:02:02,750
If I win...

6
-00:02:02,750 --> -00:01:59,130
you'll give me Kiss-Shot's right leg.

7
-00:01:59,130 --> -00:01:57,910
Is that fine with you?

8
-00:01:57,420 --> -00:01:55,500
If I win...

9
-00:01:55,500 --> -00:01:51,320
you'll tell me Heart-Under-Blade's whereabouts.

10
-00:01:50,440 --> -00:01:49,290
I'm fine with that.

11
-00:01:46,150 --> -00:01:44,850
Then let's begin.

12
-00:01:31,420 --> -00:01:30,640
NISIOISIN

13
-00:01:30,630 --> -00:01:28,630
Original Work

14
-00:01:30,630 --> -00:01:28,630
NISIOISIN

15
-00:01:26,750 --> -00:01:26,630
Hiroshi Kamiya

16
-00:01:26,630 --> -00:01:24,630
Koyomi Araragi
Hiroshi Kamiya

17
-00:01:19,160 --> -00:01:16,620
Masashi Ebara

18
-00:01:15,360 --> -00:01:12,610
Miyu Irino

19
-00:01:10,940 --> -00:01:08,610
Houchu Ohtsuka

20
-00:01:07,900 --> -00:01:00,470
Kizumonogatari II: Nekketsu-hen

21
-00:00:52,970 --> -00:00:50,970
Aikido
for
Dummies

22
-00:00:39,500 --> -00:00:39,160
Baseball
for
Dummies

23
-00:00:28,240 --> -00:00:26,140
Dramaturgy is a vampire.

24
-00:00:25,630 --> -00:00:23,700
A-A vampire?

25
-00:00:22,920 --> -00:00:20,930
That guy's a vampire?

26
-00:00:15,210 --> -00:00:13,870
You can tell just by looking at him.

27
-00:00:13,100 --> -00:00:10,380
Or are you saying that there
are humans with a body like his?

28
-00:00:07,740 --> -00:00:04,910
I've lived for five hundred years

29
-00:00:04,910 --> -00:00:02,520
but I've never heard of a human like that.

30
-00:00:02,040 --> -00:00:01,290
But...

31
-00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,150
why did a vampire become a
vampire-exorcising specialist?

32
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,930
I don't get it.

33
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,880
A vampire that would kill its brethren...

34
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,300
isn't all that unusual.

35
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,840
An eye for an eye,

36
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,090
a tooth for a tooth

37
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,390
and, of course, a vampire for a vampire.

38
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,190
Right?

39
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,190
Is that you, Araragi-kun?

40
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,200
Hanekawa...

41
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,920
Nope.

42
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,390
I won't let you see them today.

43
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,330
What— What— What— What—

44
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,530
What are— What are— What are—

45
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,710
you talking about?

46
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,230
I don't— I don't— I don't—

47
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:41,830
understand.

48
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,190
—stand —stand —stand —stand .

49
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,940
Unfortunately,
I have no idea what you are saying.

50
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,550
Hmm. What?

51
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,960
Did you forget?

52
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,990
You saw my panties.

53
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,590
Moreover, you've been staring since I got here.

54
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,460
N-No!

55
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,450
It's all a misunderstanding!

56
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,060
I just noticed the
texture of your skirt...

57
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,480
R-Right...

58
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,820
I was only looking at the texture of your skirt...

59
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,320
That's still pretty perverted.

60
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,110
Hanekawa...

61
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,160
What are you doing in a place like this?

62
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,290
Hm?

63
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,920
Taking a stroll, I guess.

64
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,960
But...

65
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,170
At this hour?

66
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,320
What are you reading, Araragi-kun?

67
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,510
A baseball book?

68
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,920
What's wrong?

69
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,030
A book you can't show to others?

70
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,490
Could it be pornographic?

71
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,480
Nonsense!

72
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,500
I've never touched such filthy books.

73
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,180
They would defile your soul.

74
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,430
And so, I'm leaving.

75
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,430
That's how it is.

76
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,710
Wait, why are you leaving so soon?

77
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,490
Let's stay and talk some more!

78
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,870
Talk?

79
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,150
What about?

80
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,940
Huh? What indeed...

81
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,060
So Araragi-kun...

82
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,250
how were your studies today?

83
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,450
Today, I focused on math.

84
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,000
Ma—

85
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,040
Math, huh?

86
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,600
Un—Unfortunately,
I worked on my Spanish today.

87
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,520
Spanish?

88
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,330
Sadly, I actually don't know Spanish.

89
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,200
Th—That's too bad.

90
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,070
Yeah.

91
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,200
I only know common words.

92
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,340
Spasibo!

93
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,060
Spasibo is Russian, you know.

94
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,610
And spasibo translates to wonderful.

95
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,500
You shouldn't do that!

96
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,900
You have to think before you speak!

97
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,120
R—Right.

98
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,520
You really do know everything.

99
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,840
I don't know everything.

100
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,150
I just know what I know.

101
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,190
At any rate...

102
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,440
Learning is a really great thing!

103
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,060
Humans are learning their whole life.

104
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,330
That one was pretty deep, Araragi-kun!

105
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,040
That's why we have to be more constructive...

106
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,750
Yeah!

107
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,590
Like thinking of ways to better society!

108
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,800
True enough.

109
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,240
How about ways to prevent bullying?

110
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,010
Hanekawa...

111
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,980
Isn't it time to go home?

112
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,990
This is usually the time I head back.

113
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:13,810
Well...

114
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,820
Well I guess this is about the time most go home...

115
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,680
You really...

116
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,940
shouldn't be out at night.

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,240
You might run into a vampire.

118
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,820
No, actually, I'm kind of hoping for it.

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,730
Don't get me wrong. I do think it's just a rumor.

120
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,800
But I can't say for sure that I won't meet one.

121
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,310
Why?

122
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,580
Why do you want to meet a vampire?

123
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,070
To be honest, I haven't thought that far ahead.

124
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,480
I guess I just want something
different from everyday events.

125
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,780
Encountering a vampire...

126
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,430
and making small talk—

127
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,980
Don't be so stupid!

128
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,280
Huh?

129
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,240
So—Sorry!

130
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,750
I said something I shouldn't have said, right?

131
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,790
No. You just irritate me.

132
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,330
It just pisses me off...

133
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,320
that arrogance of yours.

134
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,940
I like to be alone.

135
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,030
Don't follow me around.

136
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,920
A—Araragi-kun, where is this coming from?

137
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,420
Weren't we having fun chatting just now?

138
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,960
No, we weren't.

139
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,260
I was only pretending it was fun.

140
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,780
I'm only here for your money!

141
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,380
What? My family isn't rich at all!

142
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,020
Who knows if you're here just for self-satisfaction but it's pretty clear

143
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,660
that little Miss Perfect could in no way give a damn about some student like me!

144
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,680
You must feel so superior being the one to give out sympathy

145
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,600
but I never asked for your worthless pity!

146
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,950
Hanekawa Tsubasa

147
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,950
Don't go around touching other people's phones!

148
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,630
Huh?

149
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:56,380
Recall

150
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,040
Shit....

151
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:58,660
Huh?

152
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:57,250
Recall

153
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:58,500
Recall

154
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,680
Delete all 1 contacts?

155
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,180
Deleting

156
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,930
Deleted

157
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,120
So just get lost.

158
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:10,350
Recall

159
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,760
I see...

160
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,950
That will do...

161
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,310
With this...

162
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,720
I've raised my strength as a human being back.

163
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,290
I've gotten stronger.

164
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,910
That's why...

165
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,790
That's why me...

166
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,520
fighting Dramaturgy

167
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,940
and retrieving Kiss-Shot's right leg...

168
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,510
will certainly be no problem.

169
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,830
For now, that is what's most important.

170
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,280
A broken heart is...

171
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,630
no problem.

172
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
March 31st

173
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,730
Front Gates
of Naoetsu
High School

174
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,260
What's wrong?

175
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,060
You're only running away,
Heart-Under-Blade's subordinate.

176
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,810
Don't give me such a dull name!

177
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,980
How's that?

178
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,360
What's the meaning of this, Dramaturgy?

179
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,820
It is as it looks. I give up.

180
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,190
You hitting me with that is not something I can afford.

181
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,630
It would take me two whole days to recover.

182
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,370
You seem to have misunderstood.

183
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,140
Vampires cannot recover from damage instantly.

184
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,370
Your lineage is an exception.

185
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,130
After all, you are
Heart-Under-Blade's subordinate.

186
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,870
Even if I lose in terms of potential,

187
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,870
I surmised I could still win due to experience. However...

188
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,300
It is impossible.

189
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,940
I cannot hunt you.

190
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,320
But still...

191
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,720
Perhaps you'd prefer if I speak this way?

192
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,330
I'll never hunt you again.

193
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,180
Please spare my life.

194
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,090
Front Gates
of Naoetsu
High School

195
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,340
In any case...

196
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,410
Right leg: retrieved.

197
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,360
What was all that?

198
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,340
Hey, Araragi-kun.

199
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,650
I'm not too sure because I only saw from a distance

200
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,690
but weren't you doing things like it was out from a romantic fiction?

201
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,480
It has nothing to do with you.

202
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,200
Rather...

203
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,750
why are you tailing me again?

204
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,460
I don't get it.

205
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,880
I told you not to follow me.

206
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,080
Stop acting like you're my friend.

207
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,540
Araragi-kun, you're not someone who would say such things.

208
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:51,430
I'm really sorry for making you say all that.

209
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,110
But right now you're in a situation

210
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,060
that forces you to say those things, right?

211
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,550
I guess I noticed too late and forced your hand.

212
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,170
Sorry!

213
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,200
But if that's the case, I want to help you!

214
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,470
Stop being so cocky!

215
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,080
Don't misunderstand.

216
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:22,970
I simply got bored of you.

217
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,720
I prefer to be alone.

218
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,670
I don't believe you.

219
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Someone who hates humans or the world itself...

220
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,000
that's not who Araragi-kun is.

221
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,840
I know that much!

222
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:35,600
Recall

223
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,310
Recall

224
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,140
Because you seemed to enjoy talking with me at least!

225
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,590
Like I said, I was only after your money!

226
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,780
And I told you my family isn't rich at all!

227
00:17:48,900 --> 00:18:04,000
TL Note: Araragi messed up the word "body" with a water bottle brand which in turn sounds the same as the phrase "I meant."

228
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,200
Then I'm after your Dakara!

229
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,550
If you're thirsty, then just say so!

230
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,630
No, I meant your body!

231
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,660
Dakara or my body? Make up your mind!

232
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,000
Your body!

233
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,770
Got that? Show me your panties again

234
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,800
and we'll be at peace.

235
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,690
Understood.

236
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,700
Satisfied?

237
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,040
Can you see them?

238
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,990
If you want, I can take off my blouse too.

239
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,060
Hey...

240
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,230
I'm sorry for my cruel words.

241
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,400
Please be my friend.

242
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,910
He really gave it back, huh?

243
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,530
That's what middlemen are for.

244
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,030
Here, Heart-Under-Blade.

245
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,140
Actually, what exactly are you going to do?

246
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,730
Your legs now are a lot smaller.

247
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,000
You can't just swap them, right?

248
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,170
I'll do this.

249
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,860
Don't watch me eat, you brutes.

250
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,960
Leave me to my meal.

251
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Have some manners.

252
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,730
By the way, Oshino...

253
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,990
What is it?

254
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:37,990
Recall

255
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,730
My left arm was blown clean off by Dramaturgy.

256
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,750
But it grew back like it was nothing.

257
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,860
Then how come Kiss-Shot's limbs don't regenerate as well?

258
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,130
Recall

259
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,300
That's probably because most of
Heart-Under-Blade's vampire immortality

260
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,400
had already been lost by the time you two met.

261
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,060
Don't you think so too?

262
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,680
No, I do think so.

263
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,930
But during my fight,

264
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,190
Recall

265
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,540
when my arms were cut off and the wrists regenerated,

266
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,200
the severed ones vanished.

267
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:25,310
So if that's how it works, Kiss-Shot's limbs should have vanished as well.

268
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,840
But they haven't.

269
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,200
Why is that?

270
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,260
They've neither regenerated nor vanished...

271
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,460
That girl has a precious lineage, Araragi-kun.

272
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,860
Her limbs were methodically stolen by those three

273
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,470
in a way that claimed ownership.

274
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,150
Those guys divided the body from the limbs did they not?

275
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:56,230
In other words, they stole more than just her limbs

276
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,840
but also her vampire existence itself.

277
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,610
Oshino.

278
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,870
Can I really become human again?

279
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,810
Well if you regain all of Heart-Under-Blade's limbs

280
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,230
then you should.

281
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,730
Isn't that what she said?

282
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,520
It was but...

283
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,870
isn't it possible that she just lied to me?

284
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,330
In order to regain her limbs, she lied...

285
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,140
Hey.

286
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,870
You shouldn't doubt her so much.

287
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,680
It'd be such a shame.

288
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,060
But—

289
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,650
Not even trusting the one who saved your life?

290
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,230
You're quite the ingrate.

291
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:48,750
Recall

292
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,620
Hey now, what's with the long face?

293
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,870
Did something nice happen?

294
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,350
Don't talk like you can see through me.

295
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
April 1st

296
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,650
Well, it must be my fault then.

297
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,820
Huh?

298
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,840
What is?

299
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,890
That you became a vampire.

300
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,110
"Speak of the devil and he'll appear," right?

301
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,370
Looks like that saying also
applies to the supernatural.

302
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,950
Speak of them, and they'll start appearing.

303
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,450
But that doesn't add up.

304
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,540
Since you were the one who told me about it,

305
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,290
you should've met a vampire too.

306
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,290
It's not like it had to.

307
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,830
The likelihood to meet one only increased.

308
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,760
Besides, in a way, I actually did meet one.

309
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,690
I met you.

310
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,980
Leaving the likelihood itself aside...

311
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,860
you were out searching for one yesterday.

312
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,840
Why is that?

313
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:50,510
You said you wanted to encounter one and then make small talk...

314
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,390
Well it's not like I was seriously searching for one.

315
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,270
That would be like asking for the moon.

316
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,370
I don't know how to say it but...

317
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,200
I just wanted something new.

318
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,870
Haven't you ever wanted a change in your life?

319
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,750
A change, huh?

320
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,160
But it's just running away from reality, in the end.

321
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,400
Personally, I'd love to return to reality right now.

322
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,410
You will. I'm sure of that.

323
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,980
Though I did say I wanted to help...

324
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,170
if it's a supernatural thing like this,

325
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,300
I don't think there's much I can do.

326
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,540
That's not true at all.

327
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,000
Even if it's just bringing clothes and the like,

328
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,060
I'm still extremely grateful.

329
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,920
It's fine. It's the least I could do.

330
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,620
Actually, shouldn't you change clothes already?

331
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,820
Your clothes are torn up.

332
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,200
That's true.

333
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,840
So uh...

334
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,560
Well, that is...

335
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,340
I'll just change tops for now, I guess.

336
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,240
You're size is M right?

337
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,060
Y—Yeah!

338
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,890
I didn't know if you wanted briefs or trunks so I got both.

339
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,440
What's wrong?

340
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,500
Not going to change?

341
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,010
I will...

342
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,700
Hold on!

343
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,800
Looks like I was right.

344
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,830
I noticed yesterday too.

345
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,460
Araragi-kun, your physique is changing a little.

346
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,710
I was barely able to recognize you from behind the other day.

347
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,750
It seems its because your muscles are changing.

348
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,290
They seem to be getting more slender or should I say firmer.

349
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,920
Becoming a vampire reshapes your body.

350
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:17,110
Your regenerative power
keeps you at optimal condition.

351
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,720
Excuse me for a bit.

352
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,390
Just from touching though,

353
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,470
you still feel very much like other humans.

354
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:37,290
However, you do seem a bit more flexible.

355
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,470
"Like other humans?"

356
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,230
Hanekawa, does that mean...

357
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,330
you've touched the bodies of other men?

358
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,070
No! No! No!

359
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,270
There's no way I would do that!

360
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,100
Th—That's right!

361
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,990
It was all baseless conjecture.

362
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,240
Yeah, I shouldn't do that.

363
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,560
Could you put your shirt on already?

364
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,360
Y—Yeah!

365
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,280
It looks great on you.

366
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,460
Thanks for all the help, Hanekawa.

367
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,780
I'll definitely pay you back.

368
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,520
You don't have to. This is all I can do.

369
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,420
Just this is more than enough.

370
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,070
Thank you, I mean it.

371
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,440
Th—That's not necessary!

372
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,290
People just help each other out in times of need!

373
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,520
If there's anything else you need me for

374
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,840
you can feel free to ask.

375
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,520
This was the best I could do for now though.

376
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,190
That's right! We should clean this room!

377
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,260
It's a total mess!

378
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,180
There's no need for that. It's always been like this.

379
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,760
That's all the more reason that we do it ourselves!

380
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,280
Any place that needs cleaning should be cleaned.

381
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,790
Hm?

382
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:32,470
Huh?

383
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,880
What is this?

384
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:34,790
Recall

385
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:35,840
Recall

386
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,780
I forgot to mention it.

387
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,090
The bag you dropped looked important

388
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:49,280
so when we got here, I went back and retrieved it.

389
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,350
Y—You goddamned traitor!

390
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,160
Um...

391
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,690
So this means you met a vampire

392
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,610
as you returned from the bookstore

393
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,730
on March 25th?

394
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,820
This was after we talked to each other?

395
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,940
So what is the meaning of this?

396
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
April 4th

397
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:26,040
Episode is a half-vampire vampire hunter...

398
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,760
End
Recall

399
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,990
Well, I can tell what that means but...

400
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:37,390
but can't I have some more information than that?

401
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,670
I forget.

402
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,660
H—Hey!

403
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,880
Just wait. I'll remember at once.

404
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,710
I remember now.

405
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,060
What do you remember?

406
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,940
That Episode fellow...

407
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,940
despises vampires with a passion.

408
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,300
Despise?

409
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,940
How come?

410
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,110
Isn't he half-vampire?

411
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,850
Well, simply put,

412
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:23,270
half-vampires are not an entity accepted in the vampire world.

413
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,290
Likewise, they're not accepted in the human world either.

414
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,870
So naturally,

415
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,620
he hates his vampire blood.

416
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:38,760
Above all, he bears a strong
hatred towards vampires.

417
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:45,000
Unlike Dramaturgy, he is here
for more personal reasons.

418
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,780
That's hilarious.

419
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,350
It sure makes me laugh!

420
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:12,470
Chief Dramaturgy lost to a brat like you of all people!

421
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,510
Well, I'll show those guys how to kill prey.

422
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,680
I'll say this now:

423
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,350
Don't think I'll go easy on you.

424
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,200
I hate picking on the weak...

425
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,780
but I love hurting villains!

426
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,480
Am I a villain?

427
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,730
Of course!

428
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,740
You're a monster after all.

429
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,230
Monster

430
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,310
You're the one...

431
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,490
Huh?

432
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,900
What am I?

433
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,320
If you've got something to say, spit it out!

434
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,460
No. It's nothing.

435
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,150
I have nothing to say to you.

436
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,390
Let's begin!

437
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,140
Th—The cross?

438
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,730
Araragi-kun!

439
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,070
You can't give up yet!

440
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,740
Your opponent turns into fog so...

441
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,150
That means you have to—

442
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,590
Hanekawa...

443
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,720
Hanekawa! Hanekawa! Hanekawa!

444
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,280
Araragi-kun, stop yelling...

445
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,730
Get a grip!

446
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,970
Your opponent turns into fog...

447
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,950
Hilarious.

448
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,290
Fog is nothing but water.

449
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,770
If I were to spread the sand, what would happen to you?

450
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,330
That's enough!

451
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,650
Anymore and you'll lose your humanity.

452
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,020
O— Oshi— O—

453
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,120
You— You were—

454
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,070
What about Hanekawa?!

455
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,420
You don't have to yell.

456
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,380
You sure are energetic today.

457
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,290
Did something good happen?

458
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,040
However...

459
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,180
even if you've still got energy,

460
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,080
I think the match is over.

461
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,830
Look, he fainted.

462
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,150
But— But—

463
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,580
Hanekawa was...

464
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,030
Hanekawa was...

465
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,530
Hanekawa was...!

466
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,880
Yes. I saw.

467
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,330
Why did you just watch then?

468
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,940
Why didn't you stop her?!

469
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,590
Not part of the fee.

470
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:43,920
I'm here to negotiate with the three vampire specialists.

471
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,640
Anything more is extra.

472
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,550
An ordinary person isn't included.

473
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,160
Then say so from the beginning!

474
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,620
If you only said so...

475
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,730
If you like, you could pay her part of the fee.

476
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,170
How about another two million?

477
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,980
Two million?

478
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,400
I'd pay even three million!

479
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,940
This isn't a game, Oshino!

480
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,680
It's no game. It's about gain.

481
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:18,920
Game

482
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,050
Gain

483
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,180
And with that, negotiations are complete.

484
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,310
So, I'll give you a hint.

485
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,040
Use your head a little, Araragi-kun.

486
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,540
What can you use your immortal body for?

487
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,870
Hanekawa...

488
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,860
Araragi-kun?

489
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:34,890
Why are you rubbing your cheek on my stomach like it's a prized possession?

490
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,950
And it looks like my uniform's been ripped off.

491
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,880
Could this mean you're...

492
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,520
Sorry, Hanekawa.

493
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,540
Please let me stay like this a bit longer.

494
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,770
April 5th

495
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,680
My body sure feels a lot better now!

496
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,170
You could say I've almost recovered my immortality.

497
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:02,420
Then could that mean you can fight the next battle?

498
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:08,260
Unfortunately, it seems I still cannot use any of my vampiric skills.

499
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:13,000
It just means I'm harder to kill now.

500
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,720
I'd be able to fight Dramaturgy in this state,

501
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,990
but someone like Episode could be a problem.

502
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,880
And if the opponent were Guillotinecutter...

503
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,770
Guillotinecutter, huh?

504
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,770
Recall

505
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,100
He's a human, isn't he?

506
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,540
Indeed. He's not vampire like Dramaturgy

507
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,020
neither is he a half-vampire like Episode.

508
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:38,160
Recall

509
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,420
He is, for all intents and purposes, human.

510
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,910
He doesn't seem human at all though.

511
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,860
Hmph. Indeed.

512
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,480
More specifically, he's a priest.

513
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,840
Don't tell me he's of the
special forces of Christianity.

514
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,670
Close but not quite.

515
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,060
But in the end, he's human, right?

516
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:10,120
No matter what tricks he uses,
isn't he still no match for a vampire?

517
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:16,210
While he's not at all a vampire, but instead human,

518
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:19,370
his specialty is still that of vampire exorcism.

519
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,940
That's what you have to be careful of.

520
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:26,820
He stole both of my arms, did he not?

521
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,420
Though, it was only because I was careless.

522
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,170
My physical condition at the time was also quite bad.

523
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,000
If it was profession for Dramaturgy

524
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,700
and personal for Episode,

525
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,090
then Guillotinecutter hunts vampires out of faith.

526
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:49,860
I speak for myself, but faith is very troublesome.

527
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,510
Hanekawa, how's your stomach wound?

528
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,980
You call it a wound but...

529
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,980
there's not so much as a scar.

530
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,840
Is that so?

531
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,160
I wonder... Let me see.

532
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,160
What do you mean "I wonder?"

533
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:19,140
Hey, Araragi-kun, would you like a sandwich?

534
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,440
This one has tomato.

535
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,630
No, I'm fine.

536
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:25,970
Oh?

537
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,690
Here, Araragi-kun.

538
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:34,690
Coca Cola.

539
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:36,980
Thank you.

540
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:41,560
And for me, I have Diet Cola.

541
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,900
Now that your naturally muscular

542
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,230
you wouldn't get fat no matter how many calories you consume.

543
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,590
I'm pretty jealous as a girl.

544
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,440
I wonder about that...

545
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,220
Well, it's more like I don't have an appetite anymore.

546
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:04,830
It feels like I'll be fine without even eating.

547
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:08,470
The appetite for vampires would have is for blood-sucking right?

548
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,030
Ah, that's right.

549
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:19,270
On that note, don't you get the urge to suck blood?

550
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,020
Hm?

551
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,350
Now that you mention it, I don't.

552
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:36,460
Hanekawa.

553
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:44,150
It's better if you don't come here anymore.

554
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,600
Well, I guess I was expecting that.

555
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,830
Please. I don't want you to get hurt.

556
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,100
This time, it will be a lot different.

557
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,170
Even with the other times...

558
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:03,910
I didn't want to involve you at all.

559
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:08,680
I probably went too far when I wanted you to leave.

560
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,720
I'm sorry for shouting at you.

561
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:16,150
But this time is different.

562
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,140
How is it different?

563
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,280
When you had your side blown open by Episode...

564
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,920
I completely lost myself.

565
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:28,350
Recall

566
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,500
The blood in my head just stopped.

567
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,370
It was death.

568
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:35,940
Mine?

569
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,790
Mine.

570
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,970
Have I told you about the strength of human beings?

571
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,260
When you were wounded, it hurt like it was my own.

572
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,760
No...

573
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,470
It hurt more than if it were done to me.

574
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,280
Hanekawa, I...

575
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:03,540
I don't want to become human again if it means sacrificing you.

576
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:05,810
Sacrificing me?

577
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:16,080
There's no way I'll let that happen!

578
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,100
But are you even thinking about this?

579
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,690
You're on your Spring Break

580
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,510
but your wasting it on someone like me.

581
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,800
And what's worse, you've been on the verge of death.

582
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,170
Are you even thinking about what you're doing?

583
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,200
N—Not at all!

584
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,820
I don't understand you.

585
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,550
For example, if we were to switch places,

586
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,490
I wouldn't be able to do the things you do.

587
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,830
Stepping in front of a dangerous man like that,

588
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,710
and exposing a body that wasn't even immortal.

589
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:56,580
But you do it like it's the natural thing to do...

590
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,340
You...

591
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,470
scare me.

592
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,920
You're too bright...

593
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,300
You shouldn't sacrifice yourself!

594
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,280
Don't get me wrong...

595
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,740
but I don't understand why you do so much for me.

596
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,550
I can't wrap my head around it.

597
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:25,480
I'm only a classmate you just met

598
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,140
yet for some reason you've given so much to me.

599
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,810
It's like your a saint.

600
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:39,680
But your self-sacrifice is too much for me.

601
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:44,290
It's more than I could hope to bear.

602
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,620
It's not self-sacrifice, you know.

603
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:51,340
It's not self-sacrifice at all!

604
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,750
Then what is it?

605
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,140
It's self-satisfaction.

606
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,920
Araragi-kun, you're misunderstanding me.

607
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:09,300
I'm not a kind person nor am I strong!

608
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:13,350
I only do what I want to do!

609
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:19,300
I don't think there's anyone
more self-centered than I am!

610
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,980
I'm very deceitful and stubborn.

611
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,620
Enough to anger you, at least.

612
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,860
But...

613
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:36,240
if my presence only makes it harder for you,

614
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,510
then I guess I'm doing the wrong thing.

615
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:46,370
If you say so, then it must be time I leave.

616
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,510
I guess there's nothing left I can do for you.

617
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,830
No, there's still something you can do.

618
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:57,910
Wait for me.

619
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,690
In the new semester of our school...

620
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,220
wait for me.

621
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:08,960
I'll look forward to talking to you
again from the bottom of my heart.

622
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,000
What's that sound?

623
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,990
Heartbeats.

624
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,410
A girl's heartbeats sound like that?

625
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,050
That was really dangerous.

626
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:29,770
I was about to fall in love.

627
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:33,910
So far down that you'd
have struck spring water or oil?

628
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,300
Do you always use that trick to hit on girls?

629
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:39,940
Of course not. What are you talking about?

630
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,910
To begin with, I almost never talk to girls.

631
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:47,150
Yet you talk like a womanizer and buy pornography.

632
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:52,570
Geez...

633
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:13,200
I'll lend you this.

634
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,210
Return them to me when
we meet in the new semester.

635
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,560
Araragi-kun, you like panties, don't you?

636
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,600
Uh, I...

637
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,250
Ah, but if you don't want them...

638
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,620
No! No! No!

639
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,730
I never said I didn't.

640
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,530
This isn't a matter of whether I want them or not!

641
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:35,860
So what'd you say?

642
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,620
I can return them we meet at school, right?!

643
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,040
Sorry.

644
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,590
I'm not giving them back.

645
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,320
What?

646
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,800
In fact, I'll take it to the grave.

647
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:56,850
Then it will be passed down as an heirloom of the Araragi clan.

648
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,830
Please quit it.

649
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,240
These panties have parted
with your body for all eternity!

650
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,700
What's with you?!

651
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,790
I won't give them back but...

652
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,270
in exchange:

653
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:10,900
I'll definitely pay back my debt.

654
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,290
Whenever you're in trouble,

655
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,350
even if there's nothing I can do

656
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,910
I'll be by your side without fail

657
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,640
repaying my debt to you

658
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,670
for the rest of my life.

659
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,840
Just give me back my panties already!

660
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:50,020
I'm currently going commando

661
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,820
with only a skirt for security!

662
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:57,410
And I still have to walk all the way home!

663
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:03,280
Araragi-kun, compared to this, fighting Guillotinecutter

664
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:06,160
should be no problem at all, right?!

665
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,620
That's right!

666
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:21,900
Then, good luck!

667
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:24,180
Good luck!

668
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,400
See you at school!

669
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,390
See you at school!

670
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,670
Sorry, I messed up.

671
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:02,330
Class Rep-chan got kidnapped.

672
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,110
What do I do?

673
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,320
What do I do about him?

674
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,190
Araragi-kun...

675
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,450
you have to give up your humanity.

676
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,190
Araragi-kun!

677
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:35,470
I'm sorry, Araragi-kun. I...

678
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,870
What do you plan on doing with her?

679
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,260
Nothing at all

680
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,790
as long as you don't do anything.

681
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:59,210
I don't have superhuman strength like you and the others. However,

682
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,670
I'm still quite well-built.

683
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:04,080
If it's just some girl,

684
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,080
then I can kill quite easily.

685
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,300
And you call yourself human?

686
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:16,710
Hanekawa.

687
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,780
It's all right.

688
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,590
I'll definitely save you.

689
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,680
How unsightly.

690
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:36,550
I don't have the patience to
humor your juvenile chitchat.

691
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,440
Let's start already.

692
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,640
Start what exactly?

693
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,940
The instant the fight begins,

694
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:50,660
you shall raise both hands and say "I give up."

695
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:55,710
In other words, the fight ends the moment it begins.

696
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:57,880
Fine.

697
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,020
Araragi-kun!

698
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,610
Forget about me!

699
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:06,150
There's no way I could ever do that!

700
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,600
I told you,

701
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,790
I refuse to become human if it means losing you!

702
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,520
Araragi-kun...

703
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,150
Give up your humanity

704
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,870
Certainly this...

705
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,930
is not human at all.

706
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,110
I'm no human.

707
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,680
That much is clear.

708
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,490
I am a monster.
