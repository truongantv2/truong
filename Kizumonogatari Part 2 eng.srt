00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,750
If I win...

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,370
you'll give me Kiss-Shot's right leg.

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,590
Is that fine with you?

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,000
If I win...

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,180
you'll tell me Heart-Under-Blade's whereabouts.

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,210
I'm fine with that.

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,650

A-A vampire?

25
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,570
That guy's a vampire?

26
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,630
You can tell just by looking at him.

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
Or are you saying that there
are humans with a body like his?

28
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,590
I've lived for five hundred years

but I've never heard of a human like that.

But...

31
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,650
why did a vampire become a
vampire-exorcising specialist?

32

I don't get it.

A vampire that would kill its brethren...

34
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,800
isn't all that unusual.

35
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,340
An eye for an eye,

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,590
a tooth for a tooth

37
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,890
and, of course, a vampire for a vampire.

38
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,690
Right?

39
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,690
Is that you, Araragi-kun?

Hmm. What?

00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,460
Did you forget?

52
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,490
You saw my panties.

53
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,090
Moreover, you've been staring since I got here.

54
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,960
N-No!

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,950
It's all a misunderstanding!

56
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,560
I just noticed the
texture of your skirt...

57
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,980
R-Right...

58
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,320
I was only looking at the texture of your skirt...

59
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,820
That's still pretty perverted.

60
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,610
Hanekawa...

61
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,660
What are you doing in a place like this?

62
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,790
Hm?

63
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,420
Taking a stroll, I guess.

64
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,460
But...

65
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,670
At this hour?

66
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,820
What are you reading, Araragi-kun?

67
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,010
A baseball book?

68
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,420
What's wrong?

69
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,530
A book you can't show to others?

70
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,990
Could it be pornographic?

71
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,980
Nonsense!

72
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,000
I've never touched such filthy books.

73
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,680
They would defile your soul.

74
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,930
And so, I'm leaving.

75
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,930
That's how it is.

76
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,210
Wait, why are you leaving so soon?

77
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,990
Let's stay and talk some more!

78
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,370
Talk?

79
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,650
What about?

80
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,440
Huh? What indeed...

81
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,560
So Araragi-kun...

82
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,750
how were your studies today?

83
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,950
Today, I focused on math.

84
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:01,500
Ma—

85
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,540
Math, huh?

86
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,100
Un—Unfortunately,
I worked on my Spanish today.

87
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,020
Spanish?

88
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,830
Sadly, I actually don't know Spanish.

89
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,700
Th—That's too bad.

90
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,570
Yeah.

91
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,700
I only know common words.

92
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,840
<i>Spasibo</i>!

93
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,560
<i>Spasibo</i> is Russian, you know.

94
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,110
And <i>spasibo</i> translates to wonderful.

95
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,000
You shouldn't do that!

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,400
You have to think before you speak!

97
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,620
R—Right.

98
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,020
You really do know everything.

99
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,340
I don't know everything.

100
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,650
I just know what I know.

101
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,690
At any rate...

102
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,940
Learning is a really great thing!

103

117
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,740
You might run into a vampire.

118

No, actually, I'm kind of hoping for it.

119
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,230
Don't get me wrong. I do think it's just a rumor.

120
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,300
But I can't say for sure that I won't meet one.

121
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,810
Why?

122

To be honest, I haven't thought that far ahead.

124

I guess I just want something
 different from everyday events.

the severed ones vanished.

So if that's how it works, Kiss-Shot's limbs should have vanished as well.

But they haven't.

That girl has a precious lineage, Araragi-kun.

Her limbs were methodically stolen by those three

Those guys divided the body from the limbs did they not?

275
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,730
In other words, they stole more than just her limbs

Looks like that saying also

you should've met a vampire too.

It's not like it had to.

The likelihood to meet one only increased.

You said you wanted to encounter one and then make small talk...

Well it's not like I was seriously searching for one.

315

That would be like asking for the moon.

316
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,870
I don't know how to say it but...

317

I just wanted something new.

I'm still extremely grateful.

It's fine. It's the least I could do.

00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,320
Your clothes are torn up.

332
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,700
That's true.

333
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,340
So uh...

334
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,060
Well, that is...

335
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,840
I'll just change tops for now, I guess.

336
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,740
You're size is M right?

337
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,560
Y—Yeah!

338
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,390
I didn't know if you wanted briefs or trunks so I got both.

339
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,940
What's wrong?

340
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,000
Not going to change?

341
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,510
I will...

342
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,200
Hold on!

343
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,300
Looks like I was right.

344
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,330
I noticed yesterday too.

345
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,960
Araragi-kun, your physique is changing a little.

346
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:30,210
I was barely able to recognize you from behind the other day.

347
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,250
It seems its because your muscles are changing.

348
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,790
They seem to be getting more slender or should I say firmer.

349
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,420
Becoming a vampire reshapes your body.

350
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:50,610
Your regenerative power
keeps you at optimal condition.

351
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,220
Excuse me for a bit.

352
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,890
Just from touching though,

353
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,970
you still feel very much like other humans.

354
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,790
However, you do seem a bit more flexible.

355
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,970
"Like other humans?"

356
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,730
Hanekawa, does that mean...

357
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,830
you've touched the bodies of other men?

358
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,570
No! No! No!

359
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,770
There's no way I would do that!

360
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,600
Th—That's right!

361
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,490
It was all baseless conjecture.

362
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,740
Yeah, I shouldn't do that.

363
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,060
Could you put your shirt on already?

364
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,860
Y—Yeah!

365
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,780
It looks great on you.

366
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,960
Thanks for all the help, Hanekawa.

367
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,280
I'll definitely pay you back.

368
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,020
You don't have to. This is all I can do.

369
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,920
Just this is more than enough.

370
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,570
Thank you, I mean it.

371
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,940
Th—That's not necessary!

372
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,790
People just help each other out in times of need!

373
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,020
If there's anything else you need me for

374
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,340
you can feel free to ask.

375
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,020
This was the best I could do for now though.

376
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,690
That's right! We should clean this room!

377
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,760
It's a total mess!

378
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,680
There's no need for that. It's always been like this.

379
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,260
That's all the more reason that we do it ourselves!

380
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,780
Any place that needs cleaning should be cleaned.

381
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,290
Hm?

382
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:05,970
Huh?

383
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,380
What is this?

00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,280
I forgot to mention it.

387
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,590
The bag you dropped looked important

388
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,780
so when we got here, I went back and retrieved it.

389
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,850
Y—You goddamned traitor!

390
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,660
Um...

391
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,190
So this means you met a vampire

392
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,110
as you returned from the bookstore

393
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,230
on March 25th?

394
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,320
This was after we talked to each other?

395
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,440
So what is the meaning of this?

396

{\pos(958,562)}April 4th

Recall

399
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:06,490
Well, I can tell what that means but...

400
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,890
but can't I have some more information than that?

401
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,170
I forget.

402
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,160
H—Hey!

403
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,380
Just wait. I'll remember at once.

404
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,210
I remember now.

405
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,560
What do you remember?

406
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,440
That Episode fellow...

407
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,440
despises vampires with a passion.

408
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,800
Despise?

409
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,440
How come?

410
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,610
Isn't he half-vampire?

411
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,350
Well, simply put,

412
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:56,770
half-vampires are not an entity accepted in the vampire world.

413
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,790
Likewise, they're not accepted in the human world either.

414
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,370
So naturally,

415
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,120
he hates his vampire blood.

416
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:12,260
Above all, he bears a strong
hatred towards vampires.

417
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:18,500
Unlike Dramaturgy, he is here
for more personal reasons.

418
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,280
That's hilarious.

419
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,850
It sure makes me laugh!

420
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,970
Chief Dramaturgy lost to a brat like you of all people!

421
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,010
Well, I'll show those guys how to kill prey.

422
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,180
I'll say this now:

423
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,850
Don't think I'll go easy on you.

424
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,700
I hate picking on the weak...

425
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,280
but I love hurting villains!

426
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,980
Am I a villain?

427
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,230
Of course!

428
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,240
You're a monster after all.

429
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:18,730
{\pos(958,326)}Monster

430
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,810
You're the one...

431
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:22,990
Huh?

432
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,400
What am I?

433
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,820
If you've got something to say, spit it out!

434
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,960
No. It's nothing.

435
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,650
I have nothing to say to you.

436
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,890
Let's begin!

437
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,640
Th—The cross?

438
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,230
Araragi-kun!

439
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,570
You can't give up yet!

440
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,240
Your opponent turns into fog so...

441
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,650
That means you have to—

442
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,090
Hanekawa...

443
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,220
Hanekawa! Hanekawa! Hanekawa!

444
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,780
Araragi-kun, stop yelling...

445
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,230
Get a grip!

446
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,470
Your opponent turns into fog...

447
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,450
Hilarious.

448
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,790
Fog is nothing but water.

449
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,270
If I were to spread the sand, what would happen to you?

450
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,830
That's enough!

451
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,150
 Anymore and you'll lose your humanity.

452
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,520
O— Oshi— O—

453
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,620
You— You were—

454
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,570
What about Hanekawa?!

455
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,920
You don't have to yell.

456
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,880
You sure are energetic today.

457
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,790
Did something good happen?

458
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,540
However...

459
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,680
even if you've still got energy,

460
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,580
I think the match is over.

461
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,330
Look, he fainted.

462
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,650
But— But—

463
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,080
Hanekawa was...

464
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,530
Hanekawa was...

465
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,030
Hanekawa was...!

466
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,380
Yes. I saw.

467
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,830
Why did you just watch then?

468
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,440
Why didn't you stop her?!

469
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,090
Not part of the fee.

470
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:17,420
I'm here to negotiate with the three vampire specialists.

471
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,140
Anything more is extra.

472
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,050
An ordinary person isn't included.

473
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,660
Then say so from the beginning!

474
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,120
If you only said so...

475
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,230
If you like, you could pay her part of the fee.

476
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,670
How about another two million?

477
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,480
Two million?

478
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,900
I'd pay even three million!

479
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,440
This isn't a game, Oshino!

480
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,180
It's no game. It's about gain.

Use your head a little, Araragi-kun.

What can you use your immortal body for?

Hanekawa...

488

Araragi-kun?

489
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:08,390
Why are you rubbing your cheek on my stomach like it's a prized possession?

490
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,450
And it looks like my uniform's been ripped off.

491
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,380
Could this mean you're...

492
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,020
Sorry, Hanekawa.

493
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,040

You could say I've almost recovered my immortality.

497

Then could that mean you can fight the next battle?

498
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:41,760
Unfortunately, it seems I still cannot use any of my vampiric skills.

499
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:46,500
It just means I'm harder to kill now.

500
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,220
I'd be able to fight Dramaturgy in this state,

501
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,490
but someone like Episode could be a problem.

502
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,380
And if the opponent were Guillotinecutter...

503
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,270
Guillotinecutter, huh?

504
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,270
{\pos(961,354)}Recall

505
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:04,600
He's a human, isn't he?

506
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:09,040
Indeed. He's not vampire like Dramaturgy

507
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,520
neither is he a half-vampire like Episode.

508
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:11,660
{\pos(961,354)}Recall

509
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,920
He is, for all intents and purposes, human.

510
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:19,410
He doesn't seem human at all though.

511
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,360
Hmph. Indeed.

512
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,980
More specifically, he's a priest.

513
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,340
Don't tell me he's of the
special forces of Christianity.

514
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,170
Close but not quite.

515
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,560
But in the end, he's human, right?

516
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:43,620
No matter what tricks he uses,
 isn't he still no match for a vampire?

517
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:49,710
While he's not at all a vampire, but instead human,

518
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,870
his specialty is still that of vampire exorcism.

519
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,440
That's what you have to be careful of.

520
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,320
He stole both of my arms, did he not?

521
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,920
Though, it was only because I was careless.

522
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,670
My physical condition at the time was also quite bad.

523
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,500
If it was profession for Dramaturgy

524
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,200
and personal for Episode,

525
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,590
then Guillotinecutter hunts vampires out of faith.

526
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:23,360
I speak for myself, but faith is very troublesome.

527
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,010
Hanekawa, how's your stomach wound?

528
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,480
You call it a wound but...

529
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,480
there's not so much as a scar.

530
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,340
Is that so?

531
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,660
I wonder... Let me see.

532
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,660
What do you mean "I wonder?"

533
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,640
Hey, Araragi-kun, would you like a sandwich?

534
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,940
This one has tomato.

535
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,130
No, I'm fine.

536
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,470
Oh?

537
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,190
Here, Araragi-kun.

538
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:08,190
Coca Cola.

539
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:10,480
Thank you.

540
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:15,060
And for me, I have Diet Cola.

541
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,400
Now that your naturally muscular

542
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,730
you wouldn't get fat no matter how many calories you consume.

543
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:28,090
I'm pretty jealous as a girl.

544
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:30,940
I wonder about that...

545
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:35,720
Well, it's more like I don't have an appetite anymore.

546
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,330
It feels like I'll be fine without even eating.

547
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:41,970
The appetite for vampires would have is for blood-sucking right?

548
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,530
Ah, that's right.

549
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:52,770
On that note, don't you get the urge to suck blood?

550
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,520
Hm?

551
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,850
Now that you mention it, I don't.

552
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:09,960
Hanekawa.

553
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,650
It's better if you don't come here anymore.

554
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,100
Well, I guess I was expecting that.

555
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,330
Please. I don't want you to get hurt.

556
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,600
This time, it will be a lot different.

557
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,670
Even with the other times...

558
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,410
I didn't want to involve you at all.

559
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:42,180
I probably went too far when I wanted you to leave.

560
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,220
I'm sorry for shouting at you.

561
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,650
But this time is different.

562
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,640
How is it different?

563
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,780
When you had your side blown open by Episode...

564
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,420
I completely lost myself.

565
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:01,850
{\pos(961,354)}Recall

566
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,000
The blood in my head just stopped.

567
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:05,870
It was death.

568
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,440
Mine?

569
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,290
Mine.

570
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,470
Have I told you about the strength of human beings?

571
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,760
When you were wounded, it hurt like it was my own.

572
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,260
No...

573
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,970
It hurt more than if it were done to me.

574
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,780
Hanekawa, I...

575
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:37,040
I don't want to become human again if it means sacrificing you.

576
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:39,310
Sacrificing me?

577
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:49,580
There's no way I'll let that happen!

578
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,600
But are you even thinking about this?

579
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,190
You're on your Spring Break

580
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,010
but your wasting it on someone like me.

581
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:00,300
And what's worse, you've been on the verge of death.

582
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,670
Are you even thinking about what you're doing?

583
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:04,700
N—Not at all!

584
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,320
I don't understand you.

585
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,050
For example, if we were to switch places,

586
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:16,990
I wouldn't be able to do the things you do.

587
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,330
Stepping in front of a dangerous man like that,

588
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,210
and exposing a body that wasn't even immortal.

589
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:30,080
But you do it like it's the natural thing to do...

590
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:31,840
You...

591
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,970
scare me.

592
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:39,420
You're too bright...

593
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,800
You shouldn't sacrifice yourself!

594
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,780
Don't get me wrong...

595
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:54,240
but I don't understand why you do so much for me.

596
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,050
I can't wrap my head around it.

597
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,980
I'm only a classmate you just met

598
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,640
yet for some reason you've given so much to me.

599
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,310
It's like your a saint.

600
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:13,180
But your self-sacrifice is too much for me.

601
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:17,790
It's more than I could hope to bear.

602
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,120
It's not self-sacrifice, you know.

603
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:24,840
It's not self-sacrifice at all!

604
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,250
Then what is it?

605
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:29,640
It's self-satisfaction.

606
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,420
Araragi-kun, you're misunderstanding me.

607
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:42,800
I'm not a kind person nor am I strong!

608
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,850
I only do what I want to do!

609
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,800
I don't think there's anyone
more self-centered than I am!

610
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,480
I'm very deceitful and stubborn.

611
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,120
Enough to anger you, at least.

612
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,360
But...

613
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,740
if my presence only makes it harder for you,

614
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,010
then I guess I'm doing the wrong thing.

615
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,870
If you say so, then it must be time I leave.

616
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,010
I guess there's nothing left I can do for you.

617
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:29,330
No, there's still something you can do.

618
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:31,410
Wait for me.

619
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,190
In the new semester of our school...

620
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,720
wait for me.

621
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:42,460
I'll look forward to talking to you
again from the bottom of my heart.

622
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,500
What's that sound?

623
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,490
Heartbeats.

624
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,910
A girl's heartbeats sound like that?

625
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,550
That was really dangerous.

626
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,270
I was about to fall in love.

627
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:07,410
So far down that you'd
have struck spring water or oil?

628
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:10,800
Do you always use that trick to hit on girls?

629
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,440
Of course not. What are you talking about?

630
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,410
To begin with, I almost never talk to girls.

631
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,650
Yet you talk like a womanizer and buy pornography.

632
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,070
Geez...

633
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:46,700
I'll lend you this.

634
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,710
Return them to me when
we meet in the new semester.

635
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,060
Araragi-kun, you like panties, don't you?

636
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,100
Uh, I...

637
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:00,750
Ah, but if you don't want them...

638
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,120
No! No! No!

639
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,230
I never said I didn't.

640
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:07,030
This isn't a matter of whether I want them or not!

641
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,360
So what'd you say?

642
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,120
I can return them we meet at school, right?!

643
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,540
Sorry.

644
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,090
I'm not giving them back.

645
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:22,820
What?

646
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,300
In fact, I'll take it to the grave.

647
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:30,350
Then it will be passed down as an heirloom of the Araragi clan.

648
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,330
Please quit it.

649
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:36,740
These panties have parted
with your body for all eternity!

650
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,200
What's with you?!

651
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:40,290
I won't give them back but...

652
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,770
in exchange:

653
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,400
I'll definitely pay back my debt.

654
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,790
Whenever you're in trouble,

655
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,850
even if there's nothing I can do

656
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:52,410
I'll be by your side without fail

657
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,140
repaying my debt to you

658
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,170
for the rest of my life.

659
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,340
Just give me back my panties already!

660
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:23,520
I'm currently going commando

661
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:27,320
with only a skirt for security!

662
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,910
And I still have to walk all the way home!

663
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:36,780
Araragi-kun, compared to this, fighting Guillotinecutter

664
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,660
should be no problem at all, right?!

665
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,120
That's right!

666
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:55,400
Then, good luck!

667
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,680
Good luck!

668
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:06,900
See you at school!

669
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,890
See you at school!

670
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,170
Sorry, I messed up.

671
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,830
Class Rep-chan got kidnapped.

672
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,610
What do I do?

673
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,820
What do I do about him?

674
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,690
Araragi-kun...

675
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,950
you have to give up your humanity.

676
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,690
Araragi-kun!

677
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,970
I'm sorry, Araragi-kun. I...

678
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:22,370
What do you plan on doing with her?

679
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,760
Nothing at all

680
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,290
as long as <i>you</i> don't do anything.

681
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:32,710
I don't have superhuman strength like you and the others. However,

682
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,170
I'm still quite well-built.

683
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,580
If it's just some girl,

684
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,580
then I can kill quite easily.

685
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:44,800
And you call yourself human?

686
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:50,210
Hanekawa.

687
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,280
It's all right.

688
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,090
I'll definitely save you.

689
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,180
How unsightly.

690
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:10,050
I don't have the patience to
humor your juvenile chitchat.

691
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,940
Let's start already.

692
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:17,140
Start what exactly?

693
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,440
The instant the fight begins,

694
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:24,160
you shall raise both hands and say "I give up."

695
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:29,210
In other words, the fight ends the moment it begins.

696
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:31,380
Fine.

697
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,520
Araragi-kun!

698
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,110
Forget about me!

699
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,650
There's no way I could ever do that!

700
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,100
I told you,

701
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:46,290
I refuse to become human if it means losing you!

702
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,020
Araragi-kun...

703
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,650
{\pos(928,352)}Give up your humanity

704
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,370
<i>Certainly this...</i>

705
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,430
<i>is not human at all.</i>

706
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,610
<i>I'm no human.</i>

707
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,180
<i>That much is clear.</i>

708
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,990
<i>I am a monster.</i>
