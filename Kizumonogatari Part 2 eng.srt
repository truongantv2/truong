00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,630
I've been thinking, y'know,

11
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:53,130
that skirts are totally unfit for
hiding things you don't want seen.

12
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,640
A pair of tight shorts could serve as a firewall, don't you think?

13
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,140
Dunno.

14
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,270
If you'd excuse me.

15
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,910
Wait a second!

16
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,330
You walk so fast.

17
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,050
I could hardly catch up to you,

18
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,640
Araragi.

19
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,550
Araragi

20
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,360
How do you know my name?

21
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,740
Are you surprised?

22
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,300
We go to the same school.

23
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,700
Written with an "a" from the Buddhist "antigod,"

24

Antigod

25
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
a "ra" or two for good measure,

26
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:00,950
ra

27
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,450
rara

28
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,200
and a "gi" from "ginkgo tree" too.

29
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:03,580
gi

30
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,960
And your name, Koyomi, literally means calendar.

31
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Koyomi

32
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,590
Right? Thus we have Araragi Koyomi.

33
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,090
Araragi Koyomi

34
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,110
You're Hanekawa, right?

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,980
Wow.

38
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,300
I'm impressed you remember my name. I don't stand out.

39
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,410
For our second-year finals, in the first semester,

40
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:48,250
you had a perfect score in all subjects,
even PA and art, save for one single mistake.

41
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,790
Oh please, how do you remember that?

42
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,380
Would you happen to be stalking me?

43
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,770
Nah, that'd be reading a bit too much into it.

44
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,520
It's no big deal.

45
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,770
My alien friend told me.

46
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,400
Wait, you've got friends?!

47
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
That's more of a surprise than aliens?!

48
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,490
I didn't mean it like that.

49
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,870
It's just that you seem to prefer being alone,
like a hermit or something.

50
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,110
Well, you're right. I've got no friends.

51
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:45,010
But you're so famous that even
a loner like me knows about you.

52
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,770
Stop that.

53
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,270
Jokes like that aren't funny to me.

54
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,280
Say, Araragi.

55
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,030
Say, Araragi.

56
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,540
Do you believe in vampires?

57
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,520
What about them?

58
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:24,470
I've been hearing some rumors lately about a vampire being in town.

59
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,520
They say you shouldn't stay out alone at night.

60
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,060
So vague and unfounded.

61
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,080
They say it's a very beautiful blonde woman

62
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,700
with eyes so cold it chills you to the bone.

63
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,250
And that makes them a vampire?

64
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,700
Couldn't it just be a normal human being who stands out because they're blonde?

65
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,670
Under the streetlights, her blonde hair almost shines,

66
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,910
yet she has no shadow.

67
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,840
Still, this happened at night.

68
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,590
It's not like streetlights make shadows unmistakably clear.

69
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,450
Yeah, I think it's a silly rumor too.

70
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:24,700
But if there was actually a vampire, I'd love to meet them.

71
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,950
I'm intrigued by such superhuman creatures.

72
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,790
Superhuman? Like gods?

73
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,080
It doesn't have to be a god.

74
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,590
It wouldn't be worth the trouble otherwise.

75
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,980
Ah, my bad.

76
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,230
You're so easy to chat with.

77
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:08,610
So easy I feel like I said stuff that doesn't make much sense.

78
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,760
It's weird you've got no friends when you're so fun to talk to.

79
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,170
Why don't you make friends?

80
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,420
If I made friends, I'd lose my power level.

81
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,420
What?

82
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,110
I don't think I'm following.

83
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,680
I really don't know how to word it.

84
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,190
If I had friends, I'd have to care about them.

85
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,160
If they got hurt, I'd be hurt too.

86
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,690
If they were sad, I'd be sad too.

87
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,950
Friends are just another weakness.

88
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,770
That's like an affliction for anyone.

89
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,960
But when your friends have fun, you'd have fun too.

90
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,090
When they're happy, you'd be happy too.

91
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,600
It doesn't necessarily have to be a weakness.

92
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,500
No.

93
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,410
Friends having fun would make me jealous.

94
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,140
Their happiness would just make me envious.

95
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,260
You're petty.

96
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,870
Give me a break.

Why?

101
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,330
What would I do in a library?

102
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,500
Study, of course.

103
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,820
Of course?

104
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:51,290
Alas, I'm not so diligent as to study during spring break when I don't even have any homework.

105
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,260

I'm not gonna make it, no matter what I do.

Ambulance?

145
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,960
I need no such thing.

146
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,720
I demand your blood.

147
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,980
Do you believe in vampires?

I shall take your blood as my flesh.

153
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,590
Therefore, I demand your blood.

154
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:45,720
I thought vampires were immortal.

155
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,710
I lost too much blood.

156
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,260
Too much to even regenerate or transform.

157
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,950
I am about to die.

158
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:09,330
As a lowly human, you should consider
becoming my flesh to be a great honor.

159
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,160
Blood?

160
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,310
Can't you get a transfusion or something?

161
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,100
How much do you need?

162
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,350
Everything you have should keep me alive for now.

165
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,460
I demand your blood!

166
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,710
Now! Hurry!

167
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,770

00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,210
I can get away.

170
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,220
Can you imagine any honor greater than this?

171
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,560
I can get away from this.

172
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,470
Just run.

173
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,470
That will let me

174
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,850
escape this reality.

175
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,110
What?

176
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,980
You must be jesting.

177
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,950
You refuse to help me?!

178
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:40,720
No!

179
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:45,720
No! No! I don't wanna die!

180
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,470
I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!

181
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,980
Help me! Help me, please!

182
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,990
Please, I beg you!

183
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,340
Help me...

184
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,490
No!

185
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:22,260
I'm sorry!

186
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:31,430
I'm sorry!

187
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,850
I'm sorry!

188
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:41,440
I'm sorry!

189
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,460
I'm sorry!

190
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,740
I would die.

191
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,500
She's a monster!

192
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,000
She's a vampire!

193
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,440
I don't have to help her.

194
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,670
Right?

195
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:02,980
I know, goddamn it!

196
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,810
Don't give up, you moron!

197
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,960
Are you okay with this?

198
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,510
Of course I'm not.

199
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,410
Damn it.

200
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,830
Why?

201
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,050
How did it come to this?

202
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,440
I swear I'll do better in my next life.

203
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,850
I'll be smart, and everything bad that happens will be everyone else's fault.

204
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,920
I'll be reborn into someone like that.

205
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,540
I'll help you.

206
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,900
Take my blood.

207
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,110
I give it all to you.

208
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,160
Every last drop of it.

209
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,000
Suck me dry.

210
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,530
Thank you.

211
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,870
Was it a dream?

212
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,100
Surprise

213
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,140
Surprise

214
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,180
Surprise

215
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,230
Surprise

216
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,270
Surprise

217
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:22,310
Surprise

218
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,350
Surprise

219
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,390
Surprise

220
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:22,430
Surprise

221
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:22,480
Surprise

222
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:22,520
Surprise

223
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:22,560
Surprise

224
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:22,600
Surprise

225
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:22,640
Surprise

226
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:22,680
Surprise

227
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:22,730
Surprise

228
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:22,770
Surprise

229
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:22,810
Surprise

230
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:22,850
Surprise

231
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:22,890
Surprise

232
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:22,930
Surprise

233
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:22,980
Surprise

234
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,020
Surprise

235
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,060
Surprise

236
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,100
Surprise

237
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,140
Surprise

238
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,180
Surprise

239
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,230
Surprise

240
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:23,270
Surprise

241
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:23,310
Surprise

242
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:23,350
Surprise

243
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,390
Surprise

244
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:23,430
Surprise

245
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,480
Surprise

246
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:23,520
Surprise

247
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:23,560
Surprise

248
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:23,600
Surprise

249
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:23,640
Surprise

250
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:23,680
Surprise

251
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:23,730
Surprise

252
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:23,770
Surprise

253
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:23,810
Surprise

254
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,070
Hey!

255
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,290
Wake up.

256
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,320
Just five more minutes.

257
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,320
Five minutes

258
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,040
Wake up already!

259
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,150
Not feeling it right now.

260
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,710
Feeling it

261
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,160
How long are you gonna sleep?!

262
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,970
4.6 billion years

263
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,970
Like 4.6 billion years.

264
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,350
That's enough to create Earth all over again!

265
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:09,980
March 28th

266
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,980
It's been two days?

267
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,230
Fool!

268
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,130
Good grief.

269
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,140
How stupid do you have to be
to jump right into the sunlight?

270
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,540
Your average vampire would evaporate in an instant.

271
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,150
Never go outside again while the sun is up.

272
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:25,660
You are immortal, so you would burn and regenerate, and burn and regenerate forever.

273
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,430
That is, if you consider the undead to be alive in the first place.

274
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,930
Undead?

275
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,680
Wait, are...

276
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:51,810
Flashback

277
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,310
Flashback

278
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:52,810
Flashback

279
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:03,150
I very much am Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade.

280
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,530
Call me Heart-under-blade.

281
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,750
It has been 400 years since I made my last kin.

282
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,280
You are my second.

283
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,130
Seeing your regeneration earlier,

284
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,210
I'd call it a great success.

285
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,340
Kin?

286
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,340
Kin

287
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,010
Indeed! Therefore you—

288
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,470
That reminds me. I have yet to get your name.

289
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,450
Not that I need to.

290
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:41,110
The name you bore once before is meaningless hereafter.

291
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,860
Welcome to the world of the night,

292
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,780
my servant.

293
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,470
Where...

294
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,730
Where are we?

295
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,890
I believe it was called a cram school.

296
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:31,620
It went bankrupt a few years ago and is abandoned now.

297
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,840
A suitable place to withdraw to.

298
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,710
Next question, Kiss-shot.

299
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,750
Hold on!

300
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,460
I told you to call me Heart-under-blade!

301
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,740
That's way too long.

302
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,450
I prefer Kiss-shot. It's short.

303
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,970
Can't I call you that?

304
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,890
Oh well.

305
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:01,190
If you prefer it, so shall it be.

306
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,540
I have no reason to forbid it.

307
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,440
So?

308
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,950
What is your next question?

309
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:15,600
I turned into a vampire, right?

310
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,340
Is it not obvious?

311
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,290
Do I need to spell it out for you?

312
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:24,660
You became my kin, my servant.

313
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,030
Consider it an honor.

314
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,140
Your servant...

315
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:34,670
Why do you have a child's body now?

316
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:39,180
Earlier you were more, uh, mature—

317
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,690
Sorry for not being more "mature"!

318
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,070
That's not what I meant.

319
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,570
Mature

320
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,570
And

321
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,450
Your limbs were severed

322
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,450
I took all your blood,

323
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,730
but it was insufficient.

324
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:05,260
Therefore I took a form I could sustain.

325
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,460
Still better than perishing.

326
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,390
Then again, I can only sustain a
minimum amount of immortality,

327
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:15,500
and most of my vampire powers are unavailable now.

328
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,350
Inconvenient indeed.

329
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:17,470
Flashback

330
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,220
Flashback

331
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:18,970
Flashback

332
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,630
My limbs are restored, as you can see.

333
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,150
I could at least regenerate the form,
if not the power to fill it.

334
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,910
This should suffice for now.

335
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:39,340
That said, do not forget that you are my servant.

336
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:45,080
I may look this way now,
but I am a vampire who has lived for five centuries.

337
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,540
You are but a newborn as a vampire.

338
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,420
Know your place when you address me.

339
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,390
Oh.

340
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,670
Make your replies clear.

341
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,680
Do you really understand?

342
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,690
I do...

343
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:07,310
Then as a sign of your obedience, pat my head.

344
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,500
That should do.

345
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:36,160
Why did you turn me into a vampire?

346
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:42,560
I was prepared to die being sucked dry by you.

347
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,690
I did not intend to.

348
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:51,970
All who have their blood drunk by a vampire will,
without exception, turn into vampires.

349
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,630
That is all.

350
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,000
I see...

351
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,850
It is quite convenient for me.

352
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,540
There is something I need you to do.

353
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:10,970
Your blood alone only allows me to regenerate so much.

354
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,700
I am far from my full potential.

355
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,860
Which is why you shall act in my stead.

356
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,810
What do you want from me?

357
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,810
Can I...

358
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,820
Can I return to being human?

359
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,910
I thought so.

360
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,370
I was prepared for that question.

361
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,710
So? Can I?!

362
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,580
You can.

363
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:52,820
I can guarantee that.

364
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,460
I give you my word if needed.

365
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,730
The names of three people who robbed Kiss-shot of parts of her body.

366
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:26,720
Those three are specialist vampire slayers.

367
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,730
They're the ones that killed you?

368
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,630
Are you out of your mind?

369
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,250
They have yet to finish me off.

370
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:36,970
However, they took my limbs.

371
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:39,590
I have very little regenerative power left too.

372
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:44,390
I have no chance of standing against them now.

373
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,530
You shall face those three and take back my limbs.

374
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,400
Huh?

375
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:02,820
"You shall" as if it was that simple.

376
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:08,590
To make you human once again, I must regain my full power.

377
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:11,120
I must be whole again.

378
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:16,670
My limbs are absolutely necessary for that.

379
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:22,580
But I can't fight at all.

380
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,800
Won't I just get slain instead?

381
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,110
Fool.

382
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:31,690
You still think as if you were human.

383
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,690
You are now my kin.

384
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,010
Now that I am weakened to a bare minimum,

385
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:43,700
while I am still a top-class vampire, you could still kill me.

386
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,830
So you're a weak vampire?

387
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:50,260
No!

388
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:09,880
You're weakened, so I might be stronger than you at this point,

389
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:16,000
but those three managed to take your limbs when you were whole and at full power.

390
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,900
How could I—

391
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,830
I was at a disadvantage because they came at me at once.

392
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,510
I took them lightly.

393
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:29,180
What I mean is that as long as you take on them one by one,

394
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,660
they shall stand no chance against you.

395
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:35,170
Simply put: it is an easy task.

396
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,420
What now?

397
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:05,360
Dismember

398
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,490
Would you at least hear me out?!

399
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:12,740
Dismember

400
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,740
I'm human!

401
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,000
Do you want to murder a fellow human?!

402
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:18,040
Mur

403
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,160
der

404
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:02,500
Spin

405
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:20,640
You seem so worked up.

406
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,020
Did something nice happen to you?

407
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,650
Huh?

408
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,550
Thanks for saving me.

409
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,110
No need for thanks.

410
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,400
You got saved on your own,

411
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,420
Araragi.

412
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:57,430
Don't be so alarmed.

413
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:07,130
Your stare's sharp.

414
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,790
You seem so worked up.

415
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,940
Did something nice happen to you?

416
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,280
Let's just go home for now, Araragi.

417
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:21,410
Home?

418
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,630
To that old abandoned cram school.

419
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,170
Huh?

420
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,670
Hold on a second!

421
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:34,250
How do you know about that?

422
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,050
Why are you surprised?

423
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:41,930
I'm the one who told her about it.

424
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,460
Failing to do the right thing is the sign of cowardice.

425
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:54,870
Heart-under-blade looked like she was in trouble,
dragging your body around,

426
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,200
so I gave her a good spot.

427
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:02,480
Who are you?

428
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,200
I'm just an old fart who happened to pass by.

429
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,980
Don't worry.

430
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:15,630
I'm no vampire slayer or specialist.

431
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:20,890
I practice in a much wider field.

432
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,680
I'll introduce myself properly later.

433
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,470
You're back!

434
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,770
Who is that behind you?

435
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:35,150
I feel like I've met you before.

436
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,590
That's so mean.

437
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,400
Is that all you remember of me?

438
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:40,820
So?

439
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:42,570
How did it go?

440
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,750
This is a problem.

441
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:57,450
Those three are still working together.

442
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:04,010
They took you out even at your full power.

443
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:08,220
I stand no chance against them.

444
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,300
Which is why I told you to take them on one by one!

445
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,110
They're together. It's not happening.

446
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:20,710
You said we could just lay low,
but who knows when they find us he—

447
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,860
Don't worry about that.

448
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:29,310
I drew up a boundary around here while you were asleep.

449
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:31,520
A boundary?

450
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,710
Like a barrier?

451
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,630
Something like that.

452
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,590
What's up with you, exactly?

453
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:44,910
Why did you help Kiss-shot and me?

454
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,540
I realize you're not an enemy,

455
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,810
but I doubt you'd be on our side either.

456
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,690
Jeez, you're so cruel.

457
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,200
I'm maintaining the balance.

458
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:06,730
Consider that my job.

459
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:09,330
I bridge this side and the other.

460
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,330
Introduce yourself.

461
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:14,740
You said you would.

462
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:17,170
Spin

463
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:16,170
3

464
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,170
2

465
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,460
Oshino Meme.

466
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,340
Oshino Meme

467
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,960
I'm like a rolling stone.

468
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,620
I'm kind of an authority on monsters and apparitions.

469
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:34,990
Unlike those three, I'm not great at exorcising though.

470
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:36,560
Not great?

471
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,740
Let me rephrase that.

472
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,820
I'm not a fan of it.

473
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,860
Doesn't that make you a specialist then?

474
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:48,120
Maintaining the balance is my specialty.

475
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:51,620
I negotiate from neutral ground.

476
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,870
Call me a mediator.

477
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,160
Negotiation?

478
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,170
Bridging this side and the other?

479
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:06,220
Where is "this side" and what's "the other"?

480
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,970
Speech / Voice

481
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,970
Are the two sides humans and monsters?

482
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,100
In that case, now I

483
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,980
belong to which side?

484
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,350
Monsters?

485
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,000
That's good.

486
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,980
I prefer to call them oddities though.

487
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,110
Oddity

488
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:24,990
And she's the oddity slayer.

489
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,890
She's a rare kind of vampire who can drain energy from oddities.

490
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:33,390
That makes her pretty famous actually.

491
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:41,510
I listened to your little chat earlier.

492
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:45,670
Quite the pinch you're in.

493
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:49,040
I didn't expect things to take such a difficult turn.

494
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,680
There is nothing difficult about it.

495
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,260
It is extremely simple.

496
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:57,270
In the eyes of an undying vampire, maybe.

497
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,780
It's quite the trouble for us humans.

498
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,530
Right, Araragi?

499
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:13,450
Also, Heart-under-blade,

500
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:20,580
I liked how you agreed to return
your kin Araragi to being human.

501
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,350
Should I mediate for you?

502
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:42,280
Between us and those three?

503
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,480
Who else?

504
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,990
So you'll help us?

505
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,210
No. But I'll lend you a hand.

506
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:57,810
The balance feels off as it is right now.

507
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,870
It's like I'm watching bullies get their way.

508
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:07,330
Of course, since it's my job, I'm not gonna do it for free.

509
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,130
Hm...

510
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,510
How about 2 million?

511
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,260
2 million?!

512
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:14,260
Akasegawa

513
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,600
You pay when you can, and I won't bother you about it.

514
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:22,770
That much is the least I must ask to maintain the balance.

515
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,020
But...

516
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,650
Shall we hear your exact plan?

517
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,660
Negotiations sound nice, but it is not so easy.

518
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:41,160
Trying to convince those three is futile.

519
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:45,290
All I can do is ask

520
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,130
earnestly.

521
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:53,890
If asking doesn't work, more dangerous ideas get involved.

522
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:57,640
If we can at least communicate, we can play a game.

523
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:00,890
A game?

524
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:06,550
Firstly, we need to separate them.

525
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:14,070
You said dealing with them
one by one shouldn't be an issue.

526
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:17,030
We should make that happen then.

527
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:22,660
Boy, how do you plan to negotiate with them in the first place?

528
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,020
The details are a trade secret.

529
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,670
I'll level the playing field,

530
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:33,510
and Araragi can get back your limbs.

531
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:40,210
If you regain your limbs, you also regain your full power,

532
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:45,520
which means you can return Araragi to human.

533
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,270
Servant!

534
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:53,890
I cannot procure human money.

535
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:58,520
I have no idea how heavy a debt of 2 million is.

536
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,290
Can you shoulder it?

537
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,610
Do not worry.

538
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,960
His skills are real.

539
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:14,220
I may be weak now, but even I can see that.

540
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,350
I don't have that much saved,

541
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,830
but if I get to pay when I can
and you don't press me about it,

542
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:25,980
and I don't need collateral or a guarantor,

543
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,350
then I'll shoulder it.

544
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,480
Deal then.

545
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,830
Thanks for your patronage.

546
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:36,910
Just kidding.

586
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,410
Dramaturgy

587
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:50,740
A giant of over 2 meters.
A dual wielder, he held
rippled, huge swords in
both his hands. Such
swords are commonly
referred to as flamberge.
He was a goliath, a man of
massive muscles. He wore
a headband to comb up his
unruly hair. He is the
vampire slayer that took
Kiss-shot's right arm.

It was March 31st,

Voice only

604
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,160
He wore a white cloak and had cunning eyes.
He lifted a gargantuan cross three times his size and more
than three times his weight to his shoulder with one hand.

605
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,160
He is a vampire hunter. He hunts vampires for the prize on their heads.
That makes him a bounty hunter. And furthermore—

606
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,080

So unpleasant.

620
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:55,790
Guillotine Cutter

621
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:56,250
He resembled a priest, with hair that would rival the back of a hedgehog.
He might even seem gentle at first impression.

622
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:56,410
Human

623
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:57,670
A human who denies the existence of oddities.

624
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:57,670
A human who erases the existence of oddities.

625
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:02,040

Hanekawa Tsubasa

629
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:05,340
He's a nice guy, but that's not all.

630
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:05,340
He's strong.

01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,680

635
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,550
If I can't see you ever again,

636
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,550
That was the first time

637
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:09,550
4

638
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:10,300
I felt like I finally met Hanekawa for real.

639
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:12,180
there's no point in being a human again at all!

640
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,300
3

641
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,180
No mistakes. Straight, eye to eye.

643
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,020
