1
-00:00:22,100 --> -00:00:22,099


2
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,160
It's a shame you can't see the stars in Aincrad.

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,830
But this view isn't so bad.

4
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,710
I've never seen a shooting star.

5
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,000
Where I live in the real world,
the night sky's too bright.

6
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,210
Oh yeah? Didn't know y0u're a city girl.

7
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,090
Come on, Kirito, don't tease me!

8
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,350
In my hometown,
there's a pretty famous stargazing spot.

9
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,260
There's even a small observatory.

10
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,690
Then let's promise to go see a meteor shower there someday!

11
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,310
Sure, someday.

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,440
To do that, we have to survive and clear this game.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,150
Yeah.

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,070
And then I'll give you a ring
in the real world, too.

15
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,370
On November 6, 2022,

16
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,910
10,000 players of Sword Art Online,

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,750
a game produced for the NerveGear,
a full-dive virtual reality device,

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,960
discovered on launch day that,
because of developer Akihiko Kayaha,

19
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,840
it was impossible to log out.

20
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,760
They were trapped in a cruel death game,
where "Game Over" meant dying in the real world.

21
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,520
Amid an overwhelming sense of despair,
some took up their swords to clear the game,

22
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,150
while others, succumbing to fear,
cut off all contact.

23
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,610
And there were those who killed other players.

24
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,950
And then, what seemed like an eternity went by.

25
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,620
Until two years later, on November 7, 2024,

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,790
thanks to the heroics of one player,

27
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,040
the game was finally cleared and everyone was freed.

28
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,470
In the end, 4,000 people lost their lives,

29
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,800
and with the death of mastermind Akihiko Kayaba,

30
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,350
the incident drew to a close.

31
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,860
The players who returned alive
are known as 8A0 survivors,

32
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,440
and now, they're returning t0
their normal lives in the real world.

33
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,950
The Complete SAO Incident Records

34
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,730
Um, excuse me?

35
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,730
What are those devices
you have on your ears?

36
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,030
The Rumored Gadget?
What is Augmented Reality?

37
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,700
Welcome to Augma!

38
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,040
As you can see, its popularity has exploded
immediately upon launch!

39
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,920
Let's discuss this next-generation wearable device,
the Augma.

40
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,130
Since the Augma lacks a full-dive function,

41
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,220
you might assume it's taken a step back
compared to its predecessor, the Amusphere,

42
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,890
but you'd be mistaken!

43
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,520
You could say it's a huge advantage
to be able to use it while conscious.

44
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,810
The Amusphere, which enables you
to full dive into the virtual world,

45
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,980
and AR, or rather, the Augma,
which augments reality,

46
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,900
should be considered to be
two totally different things.

47
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,110
You're absolutely right.

48
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,820
Most importantly, the Augma doesn't possess
the inherent risks of a full-dive machine.

49
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,830
In fact, there's been a surge in users
who wear it for fitness and health monitoring.

50
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,830
And one such example
is the latest game, Ordinal Scale.

51
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,670
Make Every Day an Adventure!

52
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,420
Ordinal Scale's defining feature is its ranking system.

53
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,090
Every player is given a number
that reflects their rank,

54
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,220
and as they play the game,
their rank increases.

55
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,270
When this number reaches the upper tiers,
you can receive various services

56
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,690
from participating companies
in the real world.

57
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,520
Now this is amazing.

58
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,780
There are discounts from a major online retailers
and access to premiere tickets.

59
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,490
There are exclusive shopping sites,

60
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,160
and even a coupon
for a free extra-large beef bowl.

61
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,660
Pretty tantalizing for young users!

62
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,370
Who knows what amazing benefit you'll get
if you reach No. 1?

63
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,630
The drones, launched right after the start
of the service to relieve the strain on the network,

64
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,590
now seem to be part of a new landscape.

65
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,390
And contributing to the game's growing popularity,
is its image character, Yuna.

66
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:50,390
Debuting as the world's first AR idol,
Yuna is an AI controlled by a program,

67
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,150
but as her speech and expressions
are so astonishingly natural,

68
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,650
there are constant rumors
that a real human is actually playing her.

69
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,990
Well, that mysterious aspect
might just be one reason for her popularity.

70
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,360
Actually, I'm Yuna's--

71
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,370
Uh, word is she'll be performing
her first live concert at the end of this month,

72
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,080
but the 30,000 tickets for the event
sold out instantly.

73
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,830
I finally managed to get some
after going through various routes--

74
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,380
The momentum of the Augma and Ordinal Scale
is only going to accelerate!

75
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,010
@ New National Stadium Arena
See you all there!

76
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,400
All right! We cleared it!

77
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,110
You did it, Silica! Nice assist, Liz!

78
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,280
That got us 100 points!

79
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,860
It says we get free cake! Lucky us!

80
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,660
Don't you think y0u're playing games
a little too much?

81
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,580
I-I never thought
you'd be the one telling us that, Kirito!

82
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,120
Well, you can get points from all kinds of shops.
So we might as well play, right?

83
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,290
Can't you just admit
you wanted to play with us?

84
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,130
Anyway, it's really convenient, isn't it?

85
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,090
We can watch TV anywhere we go,
it's easier to navigate than a smartphone,

86
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,560
the weather report's a total lifesaver,
and best of all, we can talk with Yui!

87
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,470
YES!

88
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,430
It seems like y0u're really into it, Liz.

89
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,730
Well, I wouldn't say that.

90
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,190
But hey, since they handed them out
to all students at the survivors' school,

91
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,190
we can at least try it out
for a bit, you know?

92
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,440
Thank you for waiting!

93
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,490
This is the clear bonus set.

94
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,870
I want this one!

95
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,120
The AI even knows what we'd like, huh?

96
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,380
What was it called, "Deep Learning"?

97
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,010
That's what you call thoughtful.
Unlike someone else we know...

98
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,090
I hear that the AI also collects data
on what you eat.

99
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,100
This may be bad. You're
consuming too many calories!

100
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,350
Liz! What's the matter?

101
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,450
How much more until the goal point?

102
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,320
About halfway.

103
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,030
It's tough for princesses,
not being able to have a part-time job.

104
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,540
No! It's not like that!

105
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,160
It's exciting to get a present
for Kirito, isn't it?

106
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,710
Yep. I'll do my best!

107
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,080
Asuna?

108
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:25,880
Who knew they'd give the entire survivors' school
free tickets to Yuna's first live concert?

109
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,720
How is attending a concert a class?

110
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,510
I know! That school is pretty strange, isn't it?

111
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,060
Well, lucky you, since you're a huge Yuna fan!

112
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,350
H-Hey, I'm not that big of a fan!

113
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,770
But you were belting out Yuna songs
with Suguha the other day at karaoke!

114
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,400
Go on! You should let everyone else hear, too!

115
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,730
You were so good!

116
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,700
Hey, Kirito, you're going
to Yuna's concert, too, right?

117
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,660
I'm not sure. I'm not much of a fan.

118
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,460
We should all go together!

119
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,920
Well, if I feel up for it.

120
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,340
I have to admit,
this thing seems like a neat gadget.

121
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,220
But I still like full-dive better.

122
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,550
Is that so?

123
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,390
Well, after being totally immersed
in another world for three years, yeah.

124
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,980
Don't tell me you want to go back.

125
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,610
That reminds me! Speaking of Aincrad,
I wonder if those rumors are true?

126
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,070
You know, that boss monsters from the old SAO
are showing up in Ordinal Scale?

127
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,320
Oh, right.

128
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,490
You mean those mysterious event battles.

129
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,080
Are they some kind of promotion?

130
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,330
I don't know, but since they keep
the locations secret till the last minute,

131
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,760
it's hard to get there in time
without a ride.

132
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,380
I wonder what's really going on?

133
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,220
So all we need is a way to get there, right?

134
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,350
Klein:
Let's do an OS boss raid together!

135
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,190
Kirito!

136
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,870
Looks like we made it just in time.

137
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,710
The location was just announced a half hour ago,
but there's already a pretty big crowd here.

138
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,130
I guess there's that many more players now.

139
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,220
What took you so long, Kirito?

140
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,720
Oh, Asuna's here, too!

141
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,810
Since Kirito wasn't that into it,
I had to drag him along.

142
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,720
Also, I won rock-paper-scissors!

143
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,810
Okay then.

144
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,060
All right!
Let's show Asuna what we're made of!

145
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,990
- Kirito, it's almost time.
- O-Okay.

146
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,660
- Ordinal Scale, activate!
- Ordinal Scale, activate!

147
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,370
That's...

148
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,120
The boss monster from floor 10 in Aincrad,
Kagachi the Samurai Lord!

149
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,960
He looks exactly like the SAO boss!

150
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,380
We can't use our sword skills now.

151
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,130
But if his attack patterns
are the same as before...

152
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,430
Y-Yuna?

153
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,390
Are you guys ready?

154
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,900
All right, let the battle begin!
Music, start!

155
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,320
All right! Yuna's started singing!
It's a special stage with a bonus!

156
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,010
I'm gonna piss myself!

157
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,260
Is this a death game?

158
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,850
That thing is huge!

159
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,850
What do you say, Kirito?

160
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,270
Wait! Time out! Time out!

161
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,500
Crap!

162
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,130
Hey! At zero HP, there's a penalty!

163
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,590
I know that!

164
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,340
Guns didn't work after all.

165
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,050
But I'd be scared to fight in close combat.

166
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,640
All right!

167
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,150
The bonus is ours!

168
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,570
I sot it!

169
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,110
Nice block!

170
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,570
Tank!

171
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,950
I'll deflect it!

172
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,350
Good. Eight of them, huh?

173
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,150
My body feels heavy.
This is definitely different from the virtual world.

174
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,820
It's targeting you!

175
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Kirito!

176
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,280
Ouch!

177
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,040
No joke, it's so hard to move!

178
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,790
That's cause you're out of shape!

179
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,670
I'm just getting started!

180
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,970
What is he doing?

181
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,550
The last attack is mine!

182
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,970
Crap!

183
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,790
Wow!

184
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,290
Rank 2?

185
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,670
Here comes his ultimate move!
Tanks, follow me!

186
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,350
Hey, not bad! All right!

187
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,350
Okay! Me, too!

188
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,630
Retreat for now!

189
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,760
All right!

190
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,560
Switch.

191
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,480
Get him!

192
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,250
That was awesome!

193
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,340
Congratulations on defeating the boss monster!

194
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,840
I just boosted your points big time!

195
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,930
Now I'm going to reward the player
who did the most tonight!

196
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,220
All right!

197
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,690
You're today's MVP! Congratulations!

198
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,110
All right. See you later!

199
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,120
Good job, Asuna.

200
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,420
The No. 2 ranked player, huh?
There's some amazing people out there.

201
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,920
My ranking shot up
just from this one boss battle. Look!

202
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,390
- Gotta hand it to those SAO bosses!
- Man, it'll be chaotic if all the users find out!

203
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,980
Huh? Looks like you barely moved up at all.

204
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,730
Be quiet. I'll leave these raids to you.

205
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,110
- Make sure Asuna gets home okay.
- I know that!

206
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,070
If he takes you somewhere strange,
give me a call. I'll come rescue you.

207
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,320
Okay!

208
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,590
An item in a place like this!

209
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,510
You're that guy from the event.

210
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,310
What, are you hunting items?

211
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,400
D0n't get cocky 'cause you're No. 2.
It won't go as easy as you think.

212
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,370
Friday, April 24, 2026
- Inside ALO, New Aincrad, Floor 22 -

213
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:23,120
Man, the floor boss's attack patterns in AR
may have been the same as the original,

214
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,830
but fighting with our real bodies
made me sore all over!

215
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,460
I'm surprised such a small party beat it.

216
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,130
Well, Asuna and I already fought it once before.

217
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,180
But the other players
were inexperienced in group battles,

218
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,720
so it was an uphill battle.

219
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,390
And you were totally wiped out, too, Kirito!

220
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,680
I wasn't used to AR battles, that's all.

221
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,860
Oh, but that Yuna girl showed up to cheer us on,
and at the very end, as a reward--

222
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,650
Big Brother, you mean
you fought a boss battle with Yuna?

223
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,030
Is that true?

224
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,320
- Big Brother!
- Kirito!

225
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,490
I'm just glad I got to see her sing live.

226
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,750
I forgot to put my name down
for one of Yuna's concert tickets.

227
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,540
That's right, I scored a pair of tickets
during the Ordinal Scale registration campaign.

228
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,210
I did, too.

229
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,880
- What? Lucky you!
- What? Lucky you!

230
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,010
All right! I'll give you one of mine!

231
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,930
- Stare.
- And I'll give one to you, Leafa.

232
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,890
- Yay!
- Yay!

233
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,480
Oh, but I actually have
kendo boot camp next week.

234
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,610
Still, I wonder what's going on.

235
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:39,410
The bosses from the old SAO showing up
in Ordinal Scale event battles?

236
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,530
There hasn't been a tie-in campaign, right?

237
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:48,920
No. And even if they wanted to do a tie-in,
Argus, the company that ran SAO, is gone.

238
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,750
Were the other players in the event
aware it was an SAO boss?

239
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,380
It didn't seem like they were.

240
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,510
I think only we were familiar
with that boss's attack patterns.

241
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,680
Switch.

242
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,100
What do you think, Kirito?

243
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,940
Yeah. It's probably like you said.

244
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,780
But if the old SAO bosses keep showing up,
more players are sure to catch on.

245
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,150
After all, you get a lot of points.

246
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,580
You mean they're trying to reproduce Aincrad
in the real world?

247
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,580
But your life isn't at risk
like with the NerveGear, is it?

248
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,750
You're overthinking it.

249
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,580
Anyway, Yui, let me know
if you find out anything.

250
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,630
Okay, Daddy!

251
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,800
If I can fight by Yuna's side,
I want to join the events, too!

252
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,170
Hey, me too!

253
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,800
Next time I'm gonna ride double
with Kirito for sure...

254
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,100
I wish they'd schedule these events
when it'd be easier for us to join in.

255
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,770
For you ladies in such a plight,
us guys in Furinkazan will happily drive you.

256
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,520
We'll pick you up!

257
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
That would worry me more!

258
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,650
Hey, now.

259
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,070
'Luna...

260
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,950
What's the matter, Yuna?

261
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,360
What is this thing?

262
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,450
It's proof that your singing thrilled everybody.

263
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,240
Oh, is that so?

264
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,210
And we'll get even more soon...

265
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,960
by getting revenge on every one of them.

266
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,670
SAO Guilds - Player Index

267
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,340
Okay, Big Brother, I'm heading out now!

268
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,510
Okay. See you later.

269
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,140
You're still in that outfit?

270
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,480
Yeah, well. I've got some research to do
on my plans for after graduation.

271
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,020
It's good that you're researching colleges,

272
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,860
but why don't you swing a shinai
or exercise once in a while?

273
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,150
Yeah, yeah. If I ever feel like it, I will.

274
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,570
- Don't forget my souvenir.
- Seriously!

275
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,870
You know, you should use this more often.

276
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,530
They even offer gym coupons!

277
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,830
See ya!

278
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,560
Shigemura Lab: Creators of the Augma

279
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,190
AR really is everywhere, huh?

280
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,790
Link start!

281
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,090
Hey, Asuna. You're here.

282
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,960
Hi, Kirito.

283
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,340
Where's Leafa?

284
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,590
Oh, Sugu just left for her boot camp.

285
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,260
It's going to be lonely.

286
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,430
True. It's gonna be tough
without her waking me up in the morning.

287
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,520
Really...

288
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,310
Make sure you eat something, okay?

289
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,320
Sure. I can cook for myself, you know.

290
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,110
I worry about you.

291
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,320
Once you're focused on something,
you forget to eat, you know?

292
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,820
Daddy's go-to meal is
plain pepperoncino pasta, after all.

293
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,160
No need for that much detail.

294
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,290
Kirito, about what we discussed the other day,

295
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,250
my mother says she'd like to meet you.

296
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,090
Well, one of these days.

297
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,170
Right.

298
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,850
The next ALO event quest has been postponed.

299
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,180
I see.

300
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,480
In the last two weeks,
there's been a 30% drop in Iogins, Mommy.

301
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,280
I guess everybody's busy with Ordinal Scale.

302
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,990
You may be right.
But I'm sure they'll come back eventually.

303
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,660
Yeah.

304
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,980
Klein: Today's boss raid is near your house.
You wanna join us? Here's the details.

305
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,020
Open on map

306
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,190
'(ovum Park

307
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,110
I'm heading out, okay?

308
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,540
Hey! Asuna!

309
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,630
Over here!

310
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,670
Sorry to drag you out here.
You weren't asleep, were you?

311
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,180
No, I was just taking a bath
and rushed right over.

312
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,890
Huh? You're not all here yet?

313
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,190
We can't get ahold of one of our members.

314
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,610
We'll jump in once we're all here,
so go on ahead.

315
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,520
All right.

316
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,490
If you're late, then I'm going to
earn all of your points, okay?

317
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,320
That's cold, Asuna!

318
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,690
Are you guys ready?

319
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,150
All right, let the battle begin!
Music, start!

320
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,450
Holy crap! Yuna showed up!

321
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,910
We gotta get going!

322
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,210
Damn, he's not answering my texts.

323
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:08,000
- We'd better go or today's prey will--
- No. Today's prey is you!

324
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,510
Why is it here?

325
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,940
Oh, a new song! How lucky!

326
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,820
As expected.

327
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,450
I can see why they were
one of the Assault Teams.

328
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,380
But...

329
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,220
I'm going to show you
the difference between AR and VR!

330
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,260
All right!

331
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,760
Score! The bonus is ours!

332
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,350
There's no pain like this in VR, right?

333
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,570
You bastard! What the hell are you doing?

334
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,410
Hey, now. What a buzzkill.

335
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,750
Damn you!

336
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,420
Hey, let's have some fun.

337
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,860
Here. You forgot something.

338
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,780
Keep your eyes open.

339
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,040
That motion...

340
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,920
A wide-range attack is coming!
Tanks, draw its attention!

341
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,920
R-Right!

342
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,260
It'll use its ultimate move soon,
so aim for its wings when it hovers!

343
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,630
Uh, right!

344
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,260
Let's finish it off once it's shot down!

345
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,010
Gotcha!

346
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,390
Fire!

347
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,860
- Now's our chance!
- Right!

348
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,410
Oh, no!

349
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,220
Hey, you're amazing.

350
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,810
Nice direction!

351
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,100
Do you have experience from other games?

352
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,400
W-Well... Th-Thanks!

353
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,690
So it's you again!

354
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,150
Congrats!

355
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,940
Oh, what a pity.

356
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,410
Well...

357
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,410
See you later, Asuna.

358
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,580
Lightning Flash Asuna...

359
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:17,920
Ordinal Scale is a truly realistic MMO game
where players are free from the fear of death.

360
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,090
And that's where I'll demonstrate my true power.

361
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,490
And now here's the latest on Ordinal Scale,
the AR game everyone's talking about.

362
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:53,790
We hear that bosses from Sword Art 0nline's
Old Aincrad have appeared in its event battles.

363
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,210
Apparently, you can haul in a ton of points
in the boss raids.

364
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,510
Not only that, but the odds there'll be
a live performance by Yuna are extremely high!

365
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,720
What I wouldn't give to rank up
and earn enough to cover my internet fees!

366
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,220
Now, now.

367
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:12,430
Also, due to "The Complete SAO Incident Records"
being published last month,

368
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:18,060
it seems there's been a surge in those wanting
to relive Sword Art Online, now shut down.

369
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,280
So people are jumping on the bandwagon
after the fact, huh?

370
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,950
That's why, along with the increase
in Augma users,

371
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:31,620
there's been a downturn in logins
for mainstream VR games like ALO and GGO.

372
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,620
Is everyone bored of VR?

373
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:41,340
I couldn't say for sure, but we have
some of the show's past guests live right now.

374
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,340
Here you go!

375
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:51,930
Salamander Race - Eugene

376
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,270
You didn't win last time, did you now?

377
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:59,270
We're extremely attached to this place, so we have no plans
to uproot ourselves. "Sleeping Knights" Guild Member - Siune

378
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:03,270
Lately, the number of players in Sylph territory
has been plunging. Sylph Leader - Sakuya

379
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:11,660
Sylph Leader - Sakuya

380
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,450
Fukajiro, where have you gone?

381
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,870
I mean, I even got my hands
on a new grenade launcher just for you!

382
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,630
- L-Leafa!
- Come back!

383
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,630
We apologize for the unseemly images.

384
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:28,220
Uh, and last but not least,
a really big guest is unexpectedly here!

385
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,050
Enjvl'!

386
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,180
Goad evening, everybody!

387
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:35,560
Only four more days till my first live arena show!

388
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,890
I hope you're all looking forward to it!

389
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,430
Good morning, Daddy!

390
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,850
Morning, Yui.

391
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:21,640
Where are we?

392
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,440
Oh, this is where Asuna participated
in that event battle yesterday.

393
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,150
It seems like Mommy's really giving it her all.

394
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,440
Looks like it.

395
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,360
Daddy, what's this mark?

396
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:38,950
Yeah, that's the day Asuna and I are going to see
a meteor shower at Mt. Doudaira.

397
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,370
That sounds lovely! I want to see it, too!

398
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,920
Of course y0u're coming with us.

399
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,920
Yay! I wonder what should I wear?

400
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,840
We promised each other in SAO.
That's where Asuna and I--

401
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,970
Hey, I know, Daddy!

402
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,600
Why d0n't you train to fight
in Ordinal Scale right now?

403
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,220
Mommy was worried about you
not getting enough exercise.

404
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,350
You'd better show her how cool you can be,
or your marriage will be in danger!

405
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,940
Ordinal Scale, activate.

406
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,410
There's just something off about this.
The lag is huge, or rather...

407
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,540
It's a different physical sensation
than virtual reality!

408
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,920
Your only option is to practice, Daddy!

409
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,460
Yui, you know what--

410
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,880
I'm sorry!

411
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,180
Who are you?

412
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,200
Yui, did you see that?

413
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,040
Yes.

414
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,290
She didn't have an NPC tag, but...

415
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,380
She didn't seem to be a player, either.

416
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,800
So that means... Is she an AR ghost?

417
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,220
No, that would be unscientific.

418
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,010
It would, right?

419
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,050
It looked like she was saying something.

420
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,230
Judging by how her lips moved,
it seems like she was saying, "Search."

421
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,860
Kirito! Thanks for waiting!

422
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,280
Sorry I went to the event on my own.

423
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,660
You d0n't have to worry about me.

424
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:45,080
By the way, you said you'd spotted some other
SAD survivors besides us in that UDX battle?

425
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,830
Yes. That No. 2 player.

426
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Oh, that guy?

427
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,300
I think he was a member
of the Knights of the Blood Oath. Probably.

428
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,090
Probably?

429
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,880
The thing is,
he's totally different than he was in SAO.

430
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,850
Back then, he went by the name Nautilus,
and he was diligent and had potential,

431
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,850
but he couldn't overcome his fear of death,
so he didn't take part in a single boss raid.

432
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,770
So his playing style totally changed, huh?

433
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,280
I can't believe how he moved so nimbly
in an AR game.

434
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,650
You'd think he was a gymnast.

435
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,030
You didn't talk to him?

436
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,910
No. Since I wasn't sure
if he'd be glad to see me in real life.

437
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,950
But since he was a fellow guild member,
I am a little concerned.

438
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,790
That's our former vice commander, huh?

439
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,170
Come on!

440
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,880
Hey, Asuna.

441
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,050
You've never heard any talk about ghosts
appearing in this park, have you?

442
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,550
Come on! Cut it out, will you?

443
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,430
You know I d0n't like ghost stories!

444
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,640
Oh, yeah. That's right.

445
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,480
By the way, Kirito,
about that promise we made...

446
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,610
Y-Yeah ?

447
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,490
My mom started grilling me
about who I was going with.

448
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,360
You mean...

449
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,240
But it's all right.

450
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,120
We need to get ready, d0n't we?

451
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,950
Yeah. You're right.

452
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,160
Daddy, Mommy?

453
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,500
I was able to find out one thing!

454
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,920
Everybody, please look at this.

455
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,800
So far, the boss monsters
have appeared every night at 9:00 PM.

456
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:24,180
This is where Daddy and Mommy fought
Kagachi the Samurai Lord two days ago.

457
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,930
And this is where Mommy battled last night.

458
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,480
Let me plot the locations
where the other nine monsters showed up.

459
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,360
And now I'm overlaying
a map of Old Aincrad on it.

460
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,650
This is...

461
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:44,030
The places where the boss monsters appeared
overlap with the dungeon in Old Aincrad!

462
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,790
To be precise, these are
the closest parks and plazas

463
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,330
to the coordinates that overlap
with the dungeon.

464
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,460
Therefore, we can make certain predictions.

465
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:58,130
I can anticipate that tonight at nine,
one will appear in Yebisu Garden Place in Shibuya!

466
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,880
If we know in advance where it's going to be,
I can join, too!

467
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,140
It's at night, so will that be okay?

468
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,890
As long as I'm with you guys, I'll be fine!

469
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,020
Funny, our parents would complain
if this was VR.

470
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,390
Well, yeah.

471
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,230
I'll be at work then, so I can't go.

472
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,820
Huh? Kirito, you're not going?

473
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,650
Nah, I'm going to pass on this one.

474
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,570
What? Are you that bad at AR battles?

475
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,820
I-\ bit.

476
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,830
Guess it can't be helped, then.

477
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,240
Bike...

478
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:36,420
All right, let's show Yuna our veteran party play!

479
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
- Right!
- Right!

480
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,170
By the way, where's Klein?

481
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,970
Who knows? Probably immersing himself
in Ordinal Scale somewhere?

482
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,260
Oh yeah,
I did see him before the battle yesterday,

483
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:51,020
but Klein never did join the event.

484
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,940
He said they were waiting on
one Furinkazan member.

485
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,320
With AR battles, it's a pain to have to
physically go to the actual venue, huh?

486
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,950
Speaking of which, we should pick a time to meet
when we go see the meteor shower, right?

487
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,450
Whatever. Let's discuss our plans for tonight.

488
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,710
First, let's decide where to meet up.

489
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,580
- Yui?
- Yes, Daddy?

490
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,920
About going to see the stars...
we're keeping it a secret from the others.

491
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,380
I'm so sorry!

492
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,710
Well, anyway,

493
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,800
could you send the bosses' location data
to my cell later?

494
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,760
Yes, I'll be sure to do that!

495
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,070
Klein

496
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:51,910
To: Agil Subject: Do you have a second? I
can't reach Klein. Know anything? Kazuto

497
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,540
Hello? Kirita?

498
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,170
Hey, Asuna.

499
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,420
Hang on a sec.

500
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,420
It really is just pasta.

501
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,260
For today, yeah.

502
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,800
That's all my cooking app ever recommends.

503
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:14,020
Seriously. Your diet's going to be so unbalanced.

504
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,310
Then make me a ragout rabbit stew
again sometime, okay?

505
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,480
That's not going to be easy. Oh, I know!

506
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,070
I can make something similar,
so I'll get the ingredients!

507
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,530
S-Sure. I can't wait.

508
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,280
Hey, Kirita.

509
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,160
About that ghost you mentioned this afternoon.

510
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,830
You asked me if I'd heard
of any stories like that in Yoyogi Park.

511
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,040
0-Oh, right.

512
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,000
I did some digging afterwards.

513
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,130
This didn't happen in Yoyogi Park,

514
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:47,920
but lately there are rumors among the players
about the ghost of a girl wearing a hoodie.

515
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,130
I-IS that right?

516
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,140
Wait, did you see her, too?

517
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,300
Of course not!

518
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,770
And I'm sure the people who said they saw her
must've mistaken an NPC for her.

519
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,770
You really think so?

520
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,980
Oh, hey!
The tent and sleeping bags I have look useable.

521
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,480
Thanks!

522
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,280
Thank goodness you had some outdoor gear
at your place!

523
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,320
Tell your father thank you for me!

524
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,700
Yeah, sure.

525
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,410
I can't wait to see the meteor shower!

526
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,710
Klein. Leader of the Furinkazan guild, huh?

527
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,210
We got a lot of them yesterday, huh?

528
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,420
I suppose so.

529
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,470
But the main dish is still yet to come.

530
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,720
Ream?

531
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,350
Does this interest you, Yuna?

532
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,810
Nothing but text. Is it a difficult book?

533
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,520
No. It's like a journal of my memories.

534
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,690
"If he draws his second sword,
no one will remain standing." it says.

535
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,030
What is this? It's so cool! Read it to me, Eiji!

536
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,080
The Black Swordsman "If he draws his second
sword, no one will remain standing."

537
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,730
YOU WIN!
YOU GET A FREE DRINK COUPON!!

538
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,800
So we meet at last, huh?

539
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,380
Have you been looking for me?

540
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,550
You don't seem to be a ghost.

541
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,430
Who are you, anyway?

542
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:04,980
Is there something you want me to search for?

543
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:10,900
Hey!

544
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:17,160
Hello?

545
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,660
You finally picked up!

546
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,540
Oh, my bad. I was driving. What's up?

547
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,290
It's Klein.

548
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,290
He's been in a hospital in Yoyogi
since last night.

549
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:29,340
Apparently his arm was broken.

550
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,960
What? Was he in an accident or something?

551
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,510
I don't have all the details,

552
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:38,970
but he said he ran into some trouble
on his way to an Ordinal Scale battle.

553
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,310
I see. Let me know when you find out more.

554
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:45,390
Right. Be careful on that bike of yours, too.

555
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:46,890
Ag“

556
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,190
Daddy...

557
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,150
To: Seijirou Kikuoka Subject: It's Kirigaya. I have something to ask of you. There's something
bugging me about the recent OS event battles. I'm calling in the favors you owe me.

558
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,450
Do you think Yuna will show up again today?

559
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:07,750
What do you think of Yuna, Silica?

560
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,250
Is she a program like they announced,
or is she actually a real human?

561
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,510
I d0n't think she's real.

562
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,090
But she d0esn't seem like just an AI either.

563
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:25,390
I agree! That crystal-clear singing voice
isn't something a real human can pr0duce--

564
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,520
Yeah, my voice isn't crystal-clear at all, is it now?

565
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,020
I didn't go that far!

566
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,940
I'm never going to karaoke with you again!

567
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,110
Sorry! Please forgive me!

568
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,530
It's almost time!

569
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,550
Are you guys ready?

570
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,720
All right, let the battle begin!
Music, start!

571
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,970
Yuna!

572
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,850
We lucked out!

573
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,770
All right, wanna go out there
and grab some points?

574
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,110
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

575
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,320
Just because there aren't any tanks!

576
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,280
Just as we planned!

577
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:26,580
This is a tough position to be in!

578
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,160
You three are kicking butt
even though you're all girls!

579
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,250
We're not gonna let you outdo us!

580
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,170
All right! Bring it on!

581
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,680
Ordinal Scale, activate!

582
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:49,980
Daddy?

583
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,980
That girl... she looks like someone.

584
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,860
You were in KoB.

585
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,490
You're Nautilus from
the Knights of the Blood Oath, right?

586
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:05,200
Please d0n't call me by that name, Asuna.

587
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:08,450
Em?

588
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,880
You've spent a lot of time in this game, I see.

589
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,590
I'm not who I was before.

590
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,050
You seem to be a lot more mellow now yourself.

591
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,050
You really think so?

592
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,840
Yes. Back then, you were much...

593
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:37,560
That girl...

594
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:39,110
Here goes!

595
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,650
It's about time.

596
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,180
Surround it!
We're all gonna attack at once!

597
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,720
What?

598
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,270
Something else is going to show up?

599
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:16,850
Pina!

600
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:17,940
Oh, is that all?

601
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,780
Pina, did you come to help us?

602
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,210
Silica! This way!

603
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,760
Daddy! That's the monster
called Dorcel the Chaos Drake,

604
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,220
who would've been the floor 91 boss!

605
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,720
Floor 91?

606
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,350
Dammit!

607
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,810
No!

608
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:59,480
Why are you going after me?

609
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:01,690
I'm sorry--

610
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,650
Silica!

611
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,450
Silica!

612
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,560
Asuna! Stay with me, Asuna!

613
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:43,860
Asuna!

614
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:46,650
Are you all right?

615
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,160
You bastard!

616
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,210
What the hell did you do?

617
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,460
How pitiful.

618
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,010
So that's all VR's greatest swordsman
amounts to in AR?

619
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,260
What did you say?

620
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,220
Hey, you!

621
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,390
Don't forget game etiquette!

622
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:34,120
Too bad!

623
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,750
Good job!

624
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,590
Hey! What about the bonus?

625
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,970
- Hey! I thought you were going to help Asuna!
- Bonus! Please kiss me!

626
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,930
Asuna! Are you okay?

627
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:06,480
That's too bad.
We'll have to wait for next time.

628
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,620
I-I'm sorry, Asuna.
It was all because I messed up.

629
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,240
You got shoved to the ground by that No. 2 guy!
What's his problem?

630
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:24,880
Yeah, but as expected of you,
vice commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath.

631
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,630
Wh-What's wrong, Asuna?

632
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,880
No! It's nothing!

633
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,760
Come on, let's go home.

634
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,340
- Okay.
- Will you be okay?

635
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,470
Here, grab onto me.

636
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,270
All right, see you. Good job tonight.

637
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,140
Kuhn?

638
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,600
What's up?

639
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:50,030
Um... do you remember
the day that you and I first met?

640
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:55,070
Sure I do. It was at that boss raid meeting
on Aincrad's first floor.

641
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:00,450
It was, wasn't it?
You asked me to join your party, didn't you?

642
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:04,290
Looking back now, I can't believe
I was able to do something like that.

643
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:34,440
I can already see the lake from here.

644
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,200
I can't...

645
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,120
Kirito! Don't go off on your own!

646
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,210
Kuhn?

647
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,030
Kirito!

648
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:19,910
Who are you?

649
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,080
I'm...

650
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:36,420
A dream?

651
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,380
Kuhn?

652
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,230
Kirito...

653
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,360
No way... Why?

654
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,080
Hello?

655
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,000
What's wrong? It's late.

656
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,680
You didn't even turn on the lights.

657
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:25,060
Sorry, Kirito, for calling you here
all of a sudden.

658
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,730
It's okay. Anyway, did something happen?

659
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:40,320
About how long have we lived here, again?

660
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:45,580
If you mean since we first bought it in SAO,
it's been two and a half years.

661
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,580
It has, hasn't it?

662
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:48,870
Asuna?

663
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,580
Just as I thought, I can't remember.

664
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,840
What can't you remember?

665
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,880
I can't remember anything
that happened in Aincrad.

666
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:04,970
How you and I met, how we fought together,
and when we lived together in this house...

667
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:07,640
Wh-What are you talking about, Asuna?

668
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,930
You're kidding, aren't you?

669
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:15,230
As more time went by,
my memories of SAO kept fading.

670
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,400
And now there's nothing left.

671
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,160
Yokohama North General Hospital

672
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:40,670
I'll have to go through the data
before I'll know any details,

673
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:45,970
but Asuna's brain shows signs of having had
its memory scanned in specific areas.

674
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,140
Memory scanning in specific areas?

675
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,480
Do you mean that
it only read her memories of SAO?

676
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,930
But how is that possible?

677
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,810
One possibility that comes to mind,

678
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,820
is that as she's reliving memories
of her time in SAO,

679
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,320
the single neurons serving as
the key to those memories were identified,

680
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,870
and then the images could've been
forcibly scanned with focused electron pulses.

681
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:12,580
In the last few days, there have been
multiple reports of similar cases in the city.

682
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,880
It could be a coincidence,
but what the patients have in common

683
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,840
is the fact that they've taken part
in that AR game's event battles.

684
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,550
So are you saying that the Augma is the cause?

685
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,630
I can't be certain of that yet.

686
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,720
Is Asuna going to be all right?

687
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:33,520
At this time, there are no signs
of any organic anomalies in the brain itself.

688
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:39,940
Most likely, her ability to recall was impaired
when the electron pulses degenerated her spine.

689
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:46,280
That said, I can't say without further observation
whether her symptoms will worsen.

690
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:51,830
In other words, she might lose even more
of her memory than she already has?

691
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,680
I'm sorry, Kirito.

692
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,930
Don't worry about it.
You still remember recent events, after all.

693
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,940
You've just temporarily forgotten
what happened in SAO.

694
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,850
It'll come back to you in no time.

695
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,280
Asuna?

696
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,200
What's wrong, Asuna?

697
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:36,620
Asuna!

698
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:15,870
Well?

699
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:24,000
I'm sorry, Kirito.
I can't remember anything, after all.

700
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,380
Even though I can remember
buying this house in ALO so clearly,

701
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:30,550
when it comes to SAO, there's nothing.

702
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,180
Mommy!

703
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,970
I'm sorry, Yui.
I know they're our precious memories.

704
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:41,690
I'm going to see if I can find out
what's going on in Ordinal Scale.

705
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:45,940
I'm sure I'll find a clue
that will help you regain your memories.

706
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,030
Thank you, Yui.

707
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:57,790
Even if I can't remember anything now,
it is true that I lived in this house with you, right?

708
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:58,790
Yes.

709
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,670
I'll go make us some tea.

710
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,170
I'll help out, too!

711
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:12,010
No. I'll do it. It'll be a nice change of pace.

712
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:09,150
I'm now more powerful
than Lightning Flash and the Black Swordsman.

713
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,980
Me, of all people!

714
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,820
Seriously, I owe it all to Ordinal Scale.

715
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:51,150
Soon, I can deliver what I promised to her.

716
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,320
Hello?

717
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,620
How's your injury?

718
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:08,000
Just the way it looks. Ouch!

719
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,630
Sorry to worry you.

720
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:14,260
Klein, has anything about you changed?

721
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:17,720
Do you remember what happened in SAO?

722
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:26,020
Well, when I try to remember,
it's like my head is in a haze.

723
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:30,730
Well, but it wasn't all fun times, right?

724
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:35,440
So I figure, if that's how it's gonna be, so be it.

725
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:49,170
I can't wait to see the meteor shower!

726
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:02,430
Welcome to Augma!

727
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:10,730
Subject: Warning about old SAD bosses It's possible your memory might be impaired if you fight the old SAO
bosses in OS. Two of my friends are suffering from it. Everyone, don't fight the old SAD bosses, it's dangerous!

728
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,810
002 That's impossible 003 No way 004 You're watching too many
sci-fi movies 005 You want the points for yourself that bad?

729
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,610
006 If that was true, it'd make the headlines 007 Come up with a better
lie... 008 lololol 009 Boring! Iwonder where it'll appear today?

730
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,860
010 Yeah, point hugger 011 Maybe it'll appear at Minato
Ward's warehouses... 012 No, maybe around Roppongi Hills?

731
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,690
Dammit!

732
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,450
Search Ordinal Scale rankings!

733
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:41,260
Hey!

734
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,510
S-Sorry about that.

735
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:45,760
Let's go.

736
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:46,640
Yeah.

737
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:58,400
I can't tell if this was simply an accident,
or done intentionally.

738
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,240
But if it's the latter,
the same thing may continue to happen.

739
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:12,250
You mean, other SAO survivors playing Ordinal Scale
could lose their memories like Asuna?

740
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:17,590
If I get taken out now,
I'll lose my memories, too.

741
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:21,090
If I lose my memories of those two years...

742
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,090
Can I be with Asuna like I always have?

743
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:29,430
Daddy, I'm sorry!
I couldn't find the player named Eiji.

744
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:34,270
I couldn't get any information from just his name
and the visual data of his previous battle.

745
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,100
I see.

746
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,770
Do your best, Daddy.

747
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:40,440
I'll be gathering data throughout this battle,
and find something to go on!

748
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:42,990
Right, I know you will.
I'm counting on you, Yui!

749
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:43,660
Right!

750
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,120
Someone's pretty pumped up, huh?

751
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,620
Sinon, why are you here?

752
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:52,160
You told everyone
it's too risky to fight the bosses,

753
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,000
but you're doing it anyway.

754
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:57,040
But it really is dangerous.

755
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,260
If you get killed by the boss,
you'll be just like Asuna--

756
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:04,260
I'll be fine. After all, I'm not an SAO survivor.

757
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,810
As long as I don't have any memories to scan,
nothing can happen to me. Right, Yui?

758
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,980
Yes, I assume so.

759
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:12,980
But there's no pr00f--

760
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:16,560
If you're that worried,
then make sure you protect me, all right?

761
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:19,730
Daddy, please look out for Sinon!

762
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,820
- Ordinal Scale, activate!
- Ordinal Scale, activate!

763
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:40,130
That's...

764
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:45,380
The floor 18 boss, Dire Tusk?
Wasn't today the floor 13 boss?

765
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:50,350
Currently, ten monsters are appearing
in multiple locations across the city!

766
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:52,180
That's what I call splurging.

767
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,100
In addition,
the bosses' locations are being shuffled!

768
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,770
- That really is the Dire Tusk.
- All right.

769
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,330
It's going to switch
to long-distance mode in a second.

770
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:17,620
We'll play it by the book, all right?

771
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,960
What does it think it's doing?

772
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:25,090
Get awaV!

773
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,480
On, crap!

774
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,620
- That's it!
- Go! Go!

775
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:09,840
You're attacking too much!

776
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:41,460
You bastard!

777
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,350
So he wasn't here today, huh?

778
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:57,560
Impressive!

779
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:59,270
My bad. You saved me.

780
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,480
You can pay me back with cake in Ginza, okay?

781
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,980
Will you let me off the hook
if I give you my beef bowl coupon?

782
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:06,020
I d0n't want that!

783
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:08,480
All right, then at least
give me a ride home on your bike.

784
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:11,280
Yuna?

785
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,240
Please wait!

786
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,830
Who are you?

787
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:28,840
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I was this close, but I got blocked.

788
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:32,680
Although I was able to confirm
that a mysterious program would activate

789
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:36,430
only when specific players
were damaged by the boss.

790
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:37,510
Is that so?

791
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:38,350
Dammit!

792
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,810
Want something to drink?

793
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,070
Search...

794
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:57,700
That's right.

795
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:01,910
Yui, do you remember which direction
the girl in the hoodie was pointing?

796
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,710
Yes. Why do you ask?

797
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:06,460
I want you to plot it over a map of Tokyo.

798
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,890
00-okayama in Setagaya Ward?

799
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,550
'M, what' s have?

800
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:21,470
Daddy, this is where
the Toto Institute of Technology is located.

801
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:23,560
So this is where I'm supposed to go?

802
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:28,730
I'm going to cross-reference Toto Institute
and Eiji's player data and run a search!

803
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,320
This person...

804
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:37,570
It's the Augma's designer,
Professor Tetsuhiro Shigemura!

805
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,540
The Augma...

806
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,040
Toto Institute of Technology

807
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:51,840
The most glaring flaw in the full-dive VR device
would be the full-dive function itself.

808
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:59,680
The risks of cutting off all of one's physical senses
in order to play a VB game are incalculable.

809
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:04,140
Needless to say, applications
for full-dive technology aren't limited to games.

810
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:07,980
Communication, browsing, digital production...

811
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:14,860
But in truth, these can be done with sight,
hearing, and limited tactile information.

812
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,450
So, rather than a dangerous full-dive device,

813
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:22,410
one should be able to choose
a safe AR device instead.

814
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,660
Does anyone have any questions so far?

815
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:31,500
All right, you there.

816
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:37,800
I believe that AR machines come with dangers
that d0n't exist in full-dive machines.

817
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,720
What are your thoughts on that?

818
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:44,560
Do you mean something like traffic accidents
while wearing such devices?

819
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,640
No. I mean that the information
added by the machine

820
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:51,150
could potentially invade
the user's perception of reality.

821
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:54,650
Full-dive technology
transforms a virtual world into reality.

822
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:58,320
But doesn't AR technology
make the real world virtual?

823
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:05,660
I'll answer that question next time.
That's it for today.

824
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,120
I'll get to the point.

825
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:12,590
Do you know someone named Eiji,
who's ranked No. 2 in Ordinal Scale?

826
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,170
I'm not sure.

827
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,710
Wasn't he in your lab?

828
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,180
I have a lot of students, you know.

829
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:25,220
Then, are you aware that SAO survivors
are suffering memory loss due to the Augma?

830
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:28,270
Doesn't the Augma
have a hidden function

831
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:31,730
that scans the user's memories
while the device is worn?

832
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:38,440
Kikuoka of the Ministry told me
you just wanted to audit my seminar.

833
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:43,490
The Augma having an irregular function equipped
will be uncovered right away under scrutiny.

834
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:48,290
And if that fact is revealed,
the Augma will be shelved like the NerveGear.

835
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:52,630
Do you really want to follow the same path
as your student, Akihiko Kayaba?

836
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:55,800
What are you talking about?

837
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:59,670
Even if such memory scanning
or whatever you call it were possible,

838
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,220
why would it be a problem
for them to lose their memories of SAO?

839
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,930
There's a saying, "Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better even of their blunders."

840
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:13,520
D0n't you think that those survivors
want to forget their terrifying past?

841
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:17,070
Next time, get yourself an official appointment.

842
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:21,150
Of course, that doesn't mean
my schedule will be open for you.

843
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:32,120
Professor, you build robots, too?

844
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,790
Excuse me.

845
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:46,100
That's right,
Prof. Shigemura does have a daughter.

846
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:49,930
Actually, he had one.
But she passed away two years ago.

847
01:11:50,350 --> 01:12:00,820
Yuuna Shigemura

848
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:05,360
What does this mean? What is he trying to do?

849
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:10,160
Like the professor said, maybe it's meant
as counseling for the SAO survivors.

850
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,710
At any rate, it's highly possible that
the Augma's equipped with a dangerous function.

851
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,670
Mr. Kikuoka, can't you use your authority
to shut down the service?

852
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:22,170
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications

853
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:22,470
I've been continuing to analyze this issue,

854
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:25,800
but we're up against a colossal project linked to
the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

855
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:28,600
I can't act unless we find solid evidence.

856
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,680
It's going to take some time.

857
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:34,060
There are a lot of SAO survivors
among the Ordinal Scale players.

858
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:37,310
If they happen to fight the bosses
from Old Aincrad,

859
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,770
there's going to be more and more cases
of memory loss.

860
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:42,150
I'll do the best that I can.

861
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:47,280
Klein and his friends in the hospital
all seemed to have the same symptoms.

862
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,580
Although their external injuries
were more troubling than their memories.

863
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:54,410
Kirito, if possible,
try not to fight any more bosses.

864
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,580
If you lose your memory as well,
that will be troublesome.

865
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,180
Asuna Yuuki

866
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:16,190
What's up?

867
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:19,690
Well, I just wanted to hear your voice.

868
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:20,820
Is that right?

869
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:25,950
Listen, Asuna.
Do you think I could see you now?

870
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,240
Oh, uh, if it's not a good time, that's okay.

871
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:34,040
No, it's fine.
I'm just a little scared to go outside.

872
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,210
Gotcha. Then I'll head over to your place.

873
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:40,710
I'm in 00-okayama right now,
so I'm about 20 minutes away.

874
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,170
P-Pardon the intrusion!

875
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,380
You don't have to be that formal.
It's fine! Nobody's home right now.

876
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:51,600
Y-Yeah, but... It's my first time--

877
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,310
Do you think I should've brought a gift?

878
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:56,730
That's not necessary! Sheesh.

879
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:58,140
Come on, this way.

880
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:06,070
Someone told me that all survivors
want to forget their terrifying pasts.

881
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:09,110
In a way, that might be true.

882
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:13,910
Yes, a lot of terrifying and sad things happened.

883
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:21,000
But those two years we spent in SAO
are precious memories that define who we are now.

884
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,170
So this is the "future room" I've heard about.

885
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:34,180
But its atmosphere reminds me
of your room back in Selmburg.

886
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,890
I'll go get us something to drink, okay?

887
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:38,980
Sure.

888
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:40,480
Make yourself at home.

889
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:12,010
To the me of tomorrow.

890
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,350
I haven 't been writing in this diary lately,

891
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:19,560
but as Imight forget what's happened
since I've returned t0 the real world, too,

892
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,850
I'm going to write down
howl feel right now.

893
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:26,940
It's already been four years
since I met Kirita, hasn't it?

894
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:32,450
All of my memories with Kirito
are sparkling like jewels.

895
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:39,240
Even if I end up losing more and more
of my memories because of Ordinal Scale,

896
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:44,290
if I can keep accumulating new memories with him,
I think I should be fine.

897
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:51,260
According to my calendar, I'm to go with Kirito
t0 the mountains in Saitama to see the stars soon,

898
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:55,430
but I've completely lost the memory
of the day we made that promise.

899
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:03,140
I've re-read this diary, and it seems like
Kirito is going to give me some kind of present,

900
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,400
but I wonder if he 'II forgive me
for forgetting our promise.

901
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:12,110
I want t0 give him something in return,
but since I'm not allowed to work part-time,

902
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,740
I 'd like to use the points and pocket money
I've saved up on a gift for him.

903
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,620
My beloved Kirito.

904
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:25,170
If I ever forget even Kirito...
If I ever lose these feelings...

905
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:28,960
If I end up not being able
t0 make new memories...

906
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:32,260
Thinking about that really scares me.

907
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:38,510
Ipray that the me of tomorrow
won't have lost what I'm feeling right now.

908
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:48,360
It's all right.
I d0n't mind you reading it, Kirito.

909
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,080
Asuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

910
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,800
I love you, Kirito. I love you so much!

911
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:18,510
Even if I lose all my memories of SAO,

912
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,600
this feeling is the one thing
that will never, ever change.

913
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:29,610
Me, too, Asuna. I love you.
I always have, and I always will.

914
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:45,080
I'm going to get your memories back
no matter what.

915
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:48,250
So I want you to trust me, Asuna.

916
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:55,210
A shooting star!

917
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,340
Hey, Eiji, tomorrow's the day.

918
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:02,300
The day when my dream of singing
in a gigantic venue comes true!

919
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,390
Right. Are you nervous?

920
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,020
Nope, not at all.

921
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:09,850
After all, I get to sing before a huge crowd!
I've got to enjoy myself.

922
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:13,440
And that's where I'm going to
become the No. 1 diva, right?

923
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:17,900
That's right. You're going to
become this world's No. 1, once and for all.

924
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:20,360
Hey, read to me from that book again, Eiji.

925
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:22,870
All right. Sure.

926
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:26,080
So where do you show up in this book, Eiji?

927
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:27,830
That's what I'd like to hear.

928
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:30,000
I'm not in it.

929
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:32,420
I don't appear in this book.

930
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,920
Those of us who couldn't fight
aren't worth remembering.

931
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,170
YES?

932
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,720
Jeez!

933
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:45,060
You're certainly taking your time
getting this job done.

934
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:48,230
Someone's caught on to our plan.
You need to hurry.

935
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,980
Yes, sir. I understand.

936
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:53,770
I've already set up the road map
to the final phase.

937
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:56,690
You'll keep your promise, won't you?

938
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:59,360
Of course I will. How could I ever forget?

939
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:00,950
I'm counting an you, sir.

940
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:02,910
By the way, about Yuna,

941
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:07,410
from time to time, her actions indicate
she has interests other than singing.

942
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:09,910
That's probably due to
her self-preservation program.

943
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,040
Just think of it as a sign
that the plan is proceeding.

944
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,250
Understood.

945
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:38,730
Treasures of Meiji Shrine

946
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:35,790
Yuuna, right?

947
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:41,300
Where is this place? Is it a dream, or...

948
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:44,760
Dreams and virtual worlds
are more or less the same thing.

949
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,800
Once you wake up,
everything becomes an ephemeral memory.

950
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:49,890
Memory...

951
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:52,850
It could be that it was all just a dream.

952
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:57,060
You clearing that death game,
and coming back to the real world.

953
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:00,980
When you open your eyes,
you might still be trapped inside Aincrad.

954
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,190
Hasn't that thought crossed your mind?

955
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,910
Sure it has,
but it's not something I've ever wanted.

956
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:11,410
I see. So you were in SAO, after all.

957
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,580
Are you Prof. Shigemura's daughter?

958
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,210
So you're alive?

959
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:20,960
Why did you send me to see the professor,
and what did you want me to do?

960
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:24,510
Why did the professor
steal Asuna's memories of SAO?

961
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,590
What exactly is the Augma?

962
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:35,180
0, stars that illuminate the sky...

963
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:40,560
Soft breeze drifting 0'er the hills...

964
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:45,280
Please grant thine blessings to
those travelers who

965
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:51,280
- are passing lnraugn the ancient oily.
- This song is...

966
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:57,660
All I want is to go on singing.
That's what I wish for.

967
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,460
What am I supposed to do?
What can I do to save Asuna?

968
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:04,920
If you want to get Asuna's memories back,

969
01:22:05,210 --> 01:22:08,630
your current ranking number
isn't nearly high enough.

970
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:11,680
Now, then, it's almost time. Wake up.

971
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:16,310
H-Hey, are you okay?

972
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:17,980
Y-Yeah.

973
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,900
Were you playing that Augma game?

974
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:23,860
I hear it's all the rage these days,
but you better be careful.

975
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,820
Try not to fall on your face, okay?

976
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:38,910
Karaoke Palace

977
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:45,420
So anyway, it seems like Silica's feeling
a little responsible, too.

978
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:49,470
I had no idea.
If only I could've been in the battles.

979
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:53,680
Klein got himself hurt
and ended up in the hospital,

980
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,760
so it might be a good thing
you couldn't make it.

981
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:59,480
Kirito told the other players
not to fight the bosses,

982
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,810
but then he fought by himself
in an Ordinal Scale battle.

983
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:04,940
Although I did kind of help him.

984
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:12,450
Th-Then, I 'II teach him some kendo moves
he can use in that game's battles!

985
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:15,870
Such beautiful sibling love.

986
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:18,540
Liz, we're going to sing together next!

987
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:21,370
Since the concert's tomorrow,
we've got to study up!

988
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,080
Now, please take this mic!

989
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,510
Is this their way of cheering her up?

990
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:33,180
Well, Asuna does look like
she's enjoying herself.?

991
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,720
So I guess it's okay?

992
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:44,650
H-Hey, what's wrong?

993
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:45,610
Are you okay?

994
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:55,200
Just like yesterday,

995
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:59,450
the bosses from floors 20 to 30
are appearing throughout the city!

996
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:01,580
I'm taking the shortest route
to take them all out!

997
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:17,600
That guy's pretty much
inflicting all the damage himself.

998
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,930
Awesome.

999
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:25,850
Wh-What the hell?

1000
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:29,770
Don't get so worked up over a game.
It's just for fun, right?

1001
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:33,950
Move!

1002
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:46,630
All right, time for a special stage.
Give it your all, you guys!

1003
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,460
Lucky us!

1004
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:28,380
Congratulations!

1005
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:34,260
I see you've finally learned how
to fight in this game, Mr. Black Swordsman.

1006
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:36,260
YQU!

1007
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:46,940
A message from "E" has arrived.

1008
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:50,650
Come to Yuna's concert.
I'll return Lightning Flash's memories there.

1009
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:23,260
Today is finally here!! Yuna's Live!
@ the New National Stadium Arena

1010
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:39,400
Wow, Yuna's popularity is mind-blowing.

1011
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,950
My throat's sore from singing too much.

1012
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,240
You got yourself way too fired up.

1013
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:46,580
Silica, thank you for yesterday!

1014
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,160
D-Don't mention it!

1015
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:51,370
Still, it's too bad for those guys, huh?

1016
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:53,170
Huh? Where's Kirito?

1017
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:56,090
He said he had to go to the bathroom.

1018
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:06,930
I'm here, as promised.

1019
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:12,850
You're giving Asuna's memories back,
even if I have to force you.

1020
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:15,900
Please d0n't rush me, Mr. Black Swordsman.

1021
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:18,280
And you're Nautilus, right?

1022
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,570
The one who couldn't confront his fear of death
and refused to fight?

1023
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:22,860
I'm Eiji now!

1024
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:27,450
That's ancient history.

1025
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,210
I'm surprised you even knew about me.

1026
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:34,330
I know someone who does. They told me.

1027
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:40,300
Seducing Lightning Flash wasn't enough,
so now you're going after Yuna?

1028
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:42,220
What are you talking about?

1029
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,800
Oh, never mind.
You've come here so casually,

1030
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:48,970
but do you really think you can beat me,
the No. 2 ranked player?

1031
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:53,190
How will I know unless I try?
It's not like y0u're No. 1.

1032
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:01,700
- Ordinal Scale, activate!
- Ordinal Scale, activate!

1033
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:51,290
I admit I took advantage of my position

1034
01:28:51,370 --> 01:28:56,620
as external board director of Argus
to give Yuuna a NerveGear and SAO.

1035
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,960
I just wanted to look good
in my daughter's eyes.

1036
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:04,380
But my stupidity is what killed her.

1037
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:06,340
Yuuna!

1038
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:18,520
Just as expected of the one
who guided players to clear SAO.

1039
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:21,900
Is that all No. 2 can do?
It d0esn't amount to much!

1040
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:31,160
In the end, people only remember the players
who fought on the front lines.

1041
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,250
Weaklings like Yuuna and me
are always overlooked!

1042
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,920
You were with Yuuna in SAO?

1043
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:37,920
Yeah, I was!

1044
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,920
I was with her
at the moment she disappeared, too!

1045
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:45,260
You've no idea how I cursed my weakness!

1046
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:49,390
Even when someone precious to me was in danger,
I couldn't even move an inch!

1047
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:57,350
Yuuna's brain was so damaged by the NerveGear,
it was impossible to save or repair it.

1048
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,520
But if I can acquire memories of Yuuna
from the other SAO players

1049
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:07,030
and combine those fragments,
I can use Deep Learning

1050
01:30:07,450 --> 01:30:11,070
to resurrect Yuuna as an AI.

1051
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:28,420
The numbers in the Ordinal System are absolute.
The one given No. 1 becomes immortal.

1052
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:31,930
It was you who designed it that way,
wasn't it, Kayaba?

1053
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:38,560
Therefore, she's "una." Latin for "one," then?

1054
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,610
In contrast to the Cardinal System,
which controlled Aincrad using cardinal numbers,

1055
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:46,820
the Ordinal System controls
using ordinal numbers.

1056
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:52,450
You discovered the system I'd discarded
during the early development stage of SAO,

1057
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:55,290
and resurrected it into a new game.

1058
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:00,120
True, the man I was before
might have done the same.

1059
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:04,710
But you see, Professor,
the man I am now believes...

1060
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:08,840
in the existence of a power
that transcends the system itself.

1061
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:17,890
Who cares if we take away memories
of that crap game, SAD?

1062
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:22,190
Is this the secret behind your power?

1063
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:27,190
Dammit!

1064
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:42,620
I can't lose to someone who denies his past self
just because he suffered once.

1065
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:48,710
All right, tell me how
to get Asuna's memories back!

1066
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:15,240
- What's going on?
- Come on! Is that all?

1067
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:27,920
That was fun!

1068
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:00,120
It's too late now.

1069
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:03,790
Almost all of the SAO survivors are here.

1070
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:10,210
We're going to scan the brains
of every SAO survivor in this venue,

1071
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:12,260
and take their memories of SAO.

1072
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:15,050
And then we're going to bring Yuuna back to life.

1073
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:17,390
What are you talking about?

1074
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:19,720
All right, it's started.

1075
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:21,890
There's no stopping it now.

1076
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:33,150
This is what I learned from Kamura,
the manufacturer of the Augma.

1077
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:38,490
Right now, the drones flying inside the stadium
are equipped with a wireless power feed function

1078
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:41,580
that can boost the output
of the Augmas themselves.

1079
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:42,990
What does that mean?

1080
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:46,250
If they run that scan inside the stadium,

1081
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:49,920
it might not just be partial memory loss
we 're looking at.

1082
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:51,920
You mean that...

1083
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,000
That's right.

1084
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:58,510
Like the NerveGear, the scan could
damage the brain, and even lead to death.

1085
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,020
I'll stop the professor.

1086
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:13,020
Kirito, tell the audience in that stadium
to take off their Augmas.

1087
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,700
What the hell is this?

1088
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:20,200
What's going on?

1089
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,080
- Let us out!
- What's going on?

1090
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:38,670
Asuna!

1091
01:34:43,890 --> 01:34:45,890
Asuna! Sorry I'm late.

1092
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:49,140
Kirito!

1093
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:54,150
Looks like we're going to have to
leave the venue entirely to Kirito.

1094
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:55,530
Let's hurry!

1095
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,200
Yuuna?

1096
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:05,620
Dad, I want you to stop this now.

1097
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,410
No, you're not Yuuna yet.

1098
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,370
I don't want to come back to life.

1099
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:17,960
You're still at the level of AI where your
self-preservation program is making you say this.

1100
01:35:18,210 --> 01:35:20,510
It won't be long now, so just wait patiently.

1101
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:21,840
Dad...

1102
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:25,510
I'm having an AI-type crawler gather the data.

1103
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:27,850
She's just finishing up.

1104
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:31,690
It's her final task.
She really did a fine job.

1105
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:33,350
Don't do it, Dad!

1106
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:36,020
If you run a high-output scan inside,

1107
01:35:36,150 --> 01:35:38,690
the resonance effect might not
just take their memories, but kill them!

1108
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:40,190
You be quiet, Yuuna!

1109
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:57,090
Catastrophe in popular VB game
10,000 people trapped in the game

1110
01:35:57,210 --> 01:36:02,050
If I can bring you back to life,
I'll gladly sell my soul to the devil!

1111
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:09,810
Even if... even if it means
following the same path as that man.

1112
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:12,770
All I want is to get that moment back.

1113
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:27,160
Give me that!

1114
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,840
So he's not making it easy for us, huh?

1115
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:42,170
Find out where that camera's connected.

1116
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:48,010
I guess we're even now, Kikuoka.

1117
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:55,980
I'm sorry. I lost to one of the players.

1118
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,810
But now all that's left to do
is the simultaneous scan.

1119
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:02,490
We can finally bring back Yuna... Yuuna...

1120
01:37:02,610 --> 01:37:05,360
You still have a final task, don't you?

1121
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:06,360
What?

1122
01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:09,870
I want you to supply me
with your memories of her as well.

1123
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:15,210
Eiji. You were with Yuuna the longest
in 8A0, weren't you?

1124
01:37:15,290 --> 01:37:16,830
What else did you expect?

1125
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:21,880
I have no use for someone
who couldn't even master the equipment I provided.!

1126
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,300
No way.

1127
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:27,800
But you said that you'd make sure
I could be with Yuuna forever!

1128
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,100
Farewell.

1129
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:49,620
- Yuuna?
- Kirito, give me a hand!

1130
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:52,990
At this rate, everyone here will be in danger!

1131
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:56,250
When the average of
all of their emotive counters goes over 10,000,

1132
01:37:56,330 --> 01:37:59,750
a high-output scan will begin,
inflicting damage on their brains!

1133
01:37:59,830 --> 01:38:01,000
R-Right!

1134
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:01,880
Everybody!

1135
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:04,170
Take off your Augmas right now!

1136
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:06,090
Take them off or you'll be in danger!

1137
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:08,510
It's no use.

1138
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:11,680
The reason he made the boss monsters appear
in all the previous events

1139
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:13,810
was to make sure everyone
would fight them here!

1140
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:15,100
Then what should I do?

1141
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,020
The place where we met yesterday...

1142
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:21,360
That was floor 100 in Old Aincrad.
Defeat its boss monster, Black Swordsman!

1143
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:23,730
If you do that, I'm sure...

1144
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,950
I'll unlock the Augma's full-dive function now,
so sit in that chair!

1145
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:29,950
The Augma has a full-dive function?

1146
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:33,450
The Augma is just a version
of the NerveGear with limited functions.

1147
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:34,700
Now hurry!

1148
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:38,290
Got it!

1149
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:40,830
You guys...

1150
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:46,130
- Let's do this.
- Right!

1151
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:47,340
Daddy, good luck!

1152
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:49,220
Yui, take care of Asuna!

1153
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:51,090
Kirito...

1154
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:55,140
It's all right. I'll be back in no time.
I'm going to save everyone else here, too.

1155
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:57,310
Trust me, and wait for me, Asuna.

1156
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:00,850
Kirito!

1157
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:03,310
When I get back, let's keep our promise.

1158
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:09,150
Link start!

1159
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:21,830
So this is floor 100 of Aincrad, the Ruby Palace.

1160
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:25,540
Who knew we'd be seeing this place
after two years.

1161
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:39,270
“An!

1162
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:46,860
So this is SAO's true last boss?

1163
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,400
Let's go!

1164
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:12,260
Switch!

1165
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:15,050
Switch!

1166
01:40:32,530 --> 01:40:33,570
Damn!

1167
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:34,910
No wav!

1168
01:40:34,990 --> 01:40:37,530
We have no chance of beating that thing!

1169
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:58,100
I'm sorry, Asuna.

1170
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:05,940
Your memory was scanned to extract information
about me, a player who died in Aincrad.

1171
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:12,570
My father is inflicting the terror of being killed
by a boss monster onto every SAO survivor,

1172
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:15,490
to run a simultaneous high-output scan
on their memories.

1173
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:20,490
If that happens, it might leave your brains
with irreparable damage.

1174
01:41:20,530 --> 01:41:22,040
It might even kill them.

1175
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,750
N-No way!

1176
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:26,120
Mommy!

1177
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:30,880
If I remove this, Kirito will be saved.

1178
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:34,920
But then Kirita won't he able
to save the people he's trying to save.

1179
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:45,600
Yuna?

1180
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:51,070
If you lost your life in SAO,
it was because you left the safe zone.

1181
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:54,650
It was because you fought a monster
and tried to clear the floor!

1182
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:56,860
I'm going to fight again.

1183
01:41:57,530 --> 01:42:00,320
Yui, I'm going to join Kirito.

1184
01:42:00,410 --> 01:42:02,540
All right, Mommy.
I'll catch up as soon as I can.

1185
01:42:06,910 --> 01:42:08,370
Link start!

1186
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:11,340
Stop it!

1187
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:15,840
Silica!

1188
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:19,720
Kirito!

1189
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:20,890
Silica!

1190
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:23,010
No!

1191
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,180
Run!

1192
01:42:25,310 --> 01:42:26,060
Dammit!

1193
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:40,530
Asuna?

1194
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:41,990
Silica!

1195
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:45,080
I'm sorry, it's all my fault!

1196
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:46,870
You were feeling guilty all this time.

1197
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,000
I'm sorry, Silica.

1198
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:51,830
Asuna!

1199
01:42:56,710 --> 01:42:58,760
Sorry I'm late, you guys!

1200
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:00,550
Are you all right?

1201
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:04,890
I'm going to fight, too. I can fight, Kirito.

1202
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:06,560
Right.

1203
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:25,080
Big Brother! Sorry to make you wait!

1204
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:28,910
Daddy! Mommy! I brought everyone!

1205
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,210
- Looks like fun!
- We're not hereto have fun!

1206
01:43:34,590 --> 01:43:37,420
All right! We're invincible in VB!

1207
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:46,890
That thing is huge!

1208
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:48,600
Those guys...

1209
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:50,060
Time is running out!

1210
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:51,390
Bombard that thing!

1211
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:54,270
It's all right! Please use this!

1212
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:03,360
This is...

1213
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:04,780
Pina!

1214
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:12,120
I've loaded the saved data
left on the SAO server onto you all.

1215
01:44:12,290 --> 01:44:14,080
Sinon, yours is a special bonus!

1216
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:20,420
All right, you guys, let's go!

1217
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:00,460
Block that!

1218
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:04,760
Let's go, Asuna!

1219
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:05,300
Right!

1220
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:11,470
Missed!

1221
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:16,940
Switch!

1222
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:18,860
This is what I can do now...

1223
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:56,060
- We did it!
- Yay!

1224
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:15,410
Now y0u've cleared it completely, eh, Kirito?

1225
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,540
Kay aha'?

1226
01:46:16,830 --> 01:46:20,000
But isn't there something
you still need to do?

1227
01:47:23,650 --> 01:47:24,820
It's Yuna!

1228
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:43,080
Why... Why?

1229
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:46,840
I was so close. Yuuna!

1230
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:55,970
Thank you, Dad.

1231
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:59,060
I'm here in your memories.

1232
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:00,600
Forever...

1233
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:44,810
That was a great performance, Yuuna.

1234
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:46,360
Thank you.

1235
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:54,740
The data for my main body was partially based
on the Aincrad floor 100 boss's resource script.

1236
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:58,240
Its language engine is what enabled me to move.

1237
01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:01,870
But the boss has been defeated,
and its saved data will be reset.

1238
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:05,370
- So I have to say goodbye to you all.
- No way!

1239
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,250
I really enjoyed myself.

1240
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:10,550
My dream of singing
before a huge crowd was realized,

1241
01:49:10,670 --> 01:49:12,760
so I couldn't be happier.

1242
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:16,090
I'm going to return something
I borrowed from you.

1243
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:19,850
The fear of death
caused your memory impairment.

1244
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:25,810
But you overcame that and fought.
So I'm sure it'll all come back to you.

1245
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:44,290
You remembered my dream.

1246
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:30,170
"Ordinal Scale" Accident at the event? An inc/den! was reported a! I/Ie
/il/e eaneerl ef/lf? idol Vane a! I/le New A/eliene/ Sled/um Arena.

1247
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:37,720
"Ordinal Scale"
Accident at the event?

1248
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:42,760
Next story. Kamura Inc., the company
that operates the Augma, has announced

1249
01:50:42,890 --> 01:50:48,440
the resignation of its head of development,
Toto Institute of Technology/s Prof. Shigemura.

1250
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:53,940
Congratulations on being discharged!

1251
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:55,440
Are you sure you're all right?

1252
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:57,940
Oh, man, that was an ordeal.

1253
01:50:57,990 --> 01:51:00,360
I'd rather do VR for games after all.

1254
01:51:00,450 --> 01:51:02,780
But isn't there more chance
of meeting girls through AR?

1255
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:07,080
It's no big deal! Games aren't for meeting girls.

1256
01:51:07,540 --> 01:51:12,290
Is that a crack about me and my wife?
And you wasted the ticket I gave you!

1257
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:15,420
- What? Ow! What the hell!
- You got a problem?

1258
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,670
Hey, now. Here are some souvenirs!

1259
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,760
Come to think of it, where did you go again?

1260
01:51:19,930 --> 01:51:23,470
Romantic Connections Marshmallow Shimane.
There weren't any computers at our lodgings,

1261
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:26,180
Romantic Connections
Marshmallow

1262
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:30,270
By the way, where are Kirito and Asuna?

1263
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:33,480
They said they had somewhere to go.
Have you heard anything?

1264
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:37,440
Well, now, it's all good.
Just forget about them.

1265
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:38,860
What the hell?

1266
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:43,160
Not showing up to celebrate his best friend
in SAO being discharged? What a jerk!

1267
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:47,540
I think I'm going to charge just you today.
To reimburse me for that ticket.

1268
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:50,910
What? I thought it was free!
You greedy merchant!

1269
01:51:51,290 --> 01:51:52,920
Oh, man...

1270
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:57,250
I wonder if I'll meet any cute girls on a quest
now that ALO's reopened?

1271
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:58,670
Not a chance!

1272
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:01,170
Mt. Doudaira

1273
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:03,550
It really gets pitch dark, huh?

1274
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,760
Yeah. Can you see, Yui?

1275
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:08,680
Yes, Daddy. I can see just fine!

1276
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:11,600
Though it is a little greenish overall.

1277
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:15,690
I never thought the three of us
would really make it here.

1278
01:52:15,860 --> 01:52:18,360
In the end, I left the house
without telling my mom.

1279
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:21,320
A-Are you sure that's okay?

1280
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,290
When we get back, I'll go meet her.

1281
01:52:32,710 --> 01:52:36,790
Asuna, do you remember?
What we promised each other in Aincrad?

1282
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,670
To go see the stars?

1283
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:41,420
Yeah. Well, that's part of it, but...

1284
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:46,760
Just kidding. I remember.
That you said you'd give me a present.

1285
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,060
Here, Kirito.

1286
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:55,060
It felt odd just getting something from you,
so here's something from me.

1287
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:56,980
Thanks.

1288
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:05,660
This time, actually put it on my finger,
and let's continue from where we left off.

1289
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:22,670
A shooting star!

1290
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:29,680
It's amazing!

1291
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:55,710
In the second edition of "The Complete SAO Incident Records,"
the following text was added.

1292
01:53:55,830 --> 01:54:02,300
"There was a diva who gave courage to the swordsmen as they set off
to fight... We must never forget any of the nameless players..."

1293
01:58:55,050 --> 01:58:59,090
What's the reason
for bringing me here, Kikuoka?

1294
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:04,810
I'm grateful that I wasn't charged with a crime,
but what are you planning to make me do?

1295
01:59:05,060 --> 01:59:10,770
I was very interested in what I saw of your AI.

1296
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:14,520
I feel as though I've seen how far
a top-down AI can go.

1297
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:18,900
However, I do believe
in another future, as well.

1298
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:23,070
As the head of the Shigemura Lab,

1299
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:26,290
which produced both Akihiko Kayaba
and Nobuyuki Sugou,

1300
01:59:26,330 --> 01:59:29,750
there's something that
I'd very much like you to see.

1301
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:34,880
Kikuoka, what on earth is this?

1302
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:38,550
Welcome to Hath.
