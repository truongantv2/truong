1
-00:02:58,800 --> -00:02:58,800


2
-00:02:58,700 --> -00:01:58,820


3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,340
When I was a child, I thought the world was a much, much simpler place.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,200
I thought there was no challenge unbeatable.
That if I tried hard enough...

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,760
Anything was possible.

6
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,500
Everything was cut and dry.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,180
You win, you lose, or it ends in a draw.

8
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,820
I need a way that's more precise.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,960
Tactics that are more efficient.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,000
I need a superior strategy.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,520
Even when you're up against the best there is.

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,880
You can still imagine how you can to defeat them the next time.

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,680
Such foolish ignorant youth...

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,580
Atleast, that's what I though.

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,420
I thought it was all an illusion or a bad joke, a vast world of stupid games.

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,800
But the truth is... life in this world didn't have to be so chaotic.

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,300
It didn't have to be so random.

18
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,400
Unreasonable, unforgiving and unfair.

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,560
Without meaning or value.

20
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,140
And so.

21
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,720
The next time.

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,820
The next time, for sure.

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,820
Why?...

24
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,640
Why can I not beat you?!

25
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,480
Not to brag or anything.

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,340
But I've only been defeated once in my entire life you know.

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,600
It's the 6th of the 10 pledges.

28
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,440
All bets made in accordance of the pledges must be upheld.

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,720
This law is absolute per the one true god who created our world of Disboard.

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,200
I'll crush you.

31
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,860
Next time, I'm destroying you, des.

32
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,380
Next time? Look...

33
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,280
If you couldn't beat those two, then you wont ever beat me.

34
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,180
Huh? You know about them?

35
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,900
You know about Sora and Shiro?

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,140
And I've got an interesting story I could tell you during our next game.

37
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,660
As thanks for this wonderful prize.

38
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,200
You're just trying to distract me you dirty cheat, des.

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,140
If you want to talk then just start talking, des.

40
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,760
Very well, then I will.

41
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,580
It's an ancient myth you'll never be able to tell anyone.

42
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,100
It's okay, I'm not listening anyway...

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,320
This is a story, that takes place over 6000 years ago.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,200
A bitter war raged, ravaging the earth and extinguishing the planets.

45
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,680
As time has gone on, no one remembers it anymore.

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,380
And yet...

47
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,780
It is one tale, I will never forget.

48
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,760
It's a big one, huh.

49
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,700
The black ash is really coming down, we should hurry.

50
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,640
Ivan?

51
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,240
I'm okay.

52
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,480
What does the Spirit Compass say?

53
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,520
I can't get a reading with all the ash...

54
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,240
We'll be relying on our senses for this recon.

55
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,120
Do not let your guard down.

56
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,040
Riku! Come here quick!

57
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,280
There's a-

58
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,980
This is...

59
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
It's a world map, Dwarfish made.

60
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,880
And it looks like this is the latest version too!

61
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,640
That's not all.

62
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,420
This shows the balance of power between the races, and even the Dwarfs strategy.

63
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,300
Ivan, Allei.

64
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,280
Compare this to what we've got, make any corrections.

65
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,020
I'll make sense of this the best I can.

66
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,300
"Ashieit"

67
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,760
A message? From the Dwarfs?

68
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,040
Fusion?

69
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,220
Detonation?

70
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,420
Exactly how much of this world do they plan to destroy?

71
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's get out of here.

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,440
Allei, don't take anything that runs on spiritual energy.

73
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,580
-Yeah but...

74
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,740
If you wanna die, go right ahead.

75
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,840
Dammit!

76
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,680
Ivan, this is an order.

77
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,040
You will die here.

78
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,940
Ashieit.

79
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,920
Ivan, wait!

80
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,020
Look after my kid, Riku.

81
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,060
Promise you'll do that for me.

82
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,500
I'm over here! Come and get me!

83
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,700
They say there used to be something called a sun.

84
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,500
Its white flames lit the heavens.

85
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,140
Turning the skies the most brilliant blue you've ever seen.

86
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,240
And then there's an old story, like something out of a fairytale.

87
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,600
The gods and their creations waged eternal war.

88
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,960
The earth burned.

89
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,900
Choking fairness with soot.

90
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,680
And raining down the ashes of the dead.

91
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,540
Riku!

92
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,380
These ashes.

93
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,560
Are all we have left to honor them.

94
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,700
I guess...

95
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,880
No-na.

96
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,060
-Here.

97
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,180
Oh wow, that's my name, it says Nona!

98
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,820
-Hey I wanna see my name too!

99
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,980
Wait, I wanna go first Coron!

100
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,620
-Sure, one at a time.

101
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,860
Coron! They're back!

102
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,880
Riku!

103
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,860
Riku.

104
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,280
Thank goodness!

105
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,480
Coron.

106
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,560
Well... You took your time, were you trying to give me a heart attack or something?

107
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,880
And come on, how many times do I have to tell you to call me Onee-chan.

108
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,180
We got back as fast as we could.

109
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,960
About Ivan...

110
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,800
Riku...

111
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,980
-Papa!

112
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,660
Nona.

113
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,360
-I'm so glad they're back, where's papa?

114
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,300
I want to show them my letter, I wrote it myself.

115
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,600
-Nona.

116
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,160
Where's Papa?

117
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,380
-Nona, listen to me.

118
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,020
Riku?

119
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Nona.

120
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,820
Papa...

121
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,320
Won't be coming home anymore.

122
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,460
How come?

123
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,080
Because he's dead.

124
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,540
You're lying!

125
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,640
It's true Nona.

126
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,920
No it's not, Papa promised me he'd come home!

127
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,820
He said we'd win, he said we humans would win!

128
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
We will win.

129
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,660
It's why, it's why your papa fought so hard.

130
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,080
He did it, so the rest of us could win.

131
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,320
That's not winning anything, it should have been you, you!

132
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,380
You're the one who should have died!

133
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,880
-Nona!

134
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,900
Why don't you two clean yourselves up in the bath?

135
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,400
I'll just dust myself off.

136
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,360
No, take a bath. You guys stink.

137
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,060
So we...

138
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,980
So we could win huh?

139
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,040
I'm a god dam hypocrite!

140
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,460
I made him throw his life away!

141
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,000
I sent him to his death!

142
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,560
I did it... It was me!

143
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,000
I killed him!

144
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,740
I sacrificed him just so I could live a little while longer!

145
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,100
If this keeps going on, then what's point.

146
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,660
How far are we willing to go?

147
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,000
Do we kill half of the people, for the sake of saving the other half?

148
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,260
Do we keep going until there's only one left!?

149
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,320
When are we going to be done with this?

150
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,080
How long!

151
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,280
Do we have to keep living like animals!

152
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,680
No human born into a world like this.

153
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,800
Can die without a purpose.

154
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,100
It's more than simply having the reason to live.

155
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,260
The mind will not accept death.

156
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,540
If it has no meaning.

157
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,400
Ivan's death was not in vain.

158
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,960
The ruins of the Elves old capital city will hold a lot of valuable information.

159
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,360
Things that most people never get a chance to see.

160
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,060
In a place such as this. Does anything make sense anymore?

161
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,920
Is it even possible to find ones sanity?

162
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,260
Dwarfs?

163
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,560
No...

164
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,980
With destruction of this scale.

165
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,900
It must have been the Flugel.

166
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,800
Look at the size of this thing.

167
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,800
Was that... My imagination?

168
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,360
No!

169
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,800
An Ex-Machina?

170
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,380
-Investigating.

171
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,120
Adjusting for current parameters.

172
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,900
Stay calm... These things operate as a particle collective.

173
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,560
They have a shared consciousness with their cluster, which means others must be nearby.

174
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,860
And that means...

175
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,780
-Conclusion.

176
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,120
If I make any hostile moves.

177
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,040
All the Ex-Machina will see me as a threat.

178
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,080
I must... remain... still.

179
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,300
I cannot resist you Onii-chan. You must make a woman out of me.

180
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,540
-Huh?

181
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,760
Error...

182
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,120
Cannot... Comprehend...

183
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,720
I think I'm the one who's failing to comprehend here...

184
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,380
Is this scenario not sufficient to bring you gratification?

185
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,500
Yeah, look, I'm real sorry.

186
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,480
But I'm not one of those weirdos who gets off on being observed by you guys, okay?

187
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,260
Query: Who are "You guys"?

188
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,640
Don't play dumb with me.

189
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,220
I know all this gets sent to that cluster thing of yours.

190
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,640
Negative, this unit has been disengaged from the cluster collective.

191
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,540
Disengaged you say?

192
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,040
So then you're on your own?

193
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,300
-Correct.

194
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,560
Well okay then.

195
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,260
What does some stray Ex-Machina want...

196
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,000
With someone like me? I mean, I'm just a human.

197
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,260
If you don't mind me asking.

198
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,840
Response: To analyse the unique language humans use among themselves.

199
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,960
The language refered to as: "The Heart"

200
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,580
The Heart, huh?

201
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,100
Reasoning: This units investigation into the existence of "The Heart".

202
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,120
Generated multiple logic errors causing this unit to be dissociated

203
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,080
Thereafter further observation has been conducted independently.

204
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,900
Observation?

205
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,520
So your plan is to study the heart on your own.

206
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,120
And get the cluster to take you back? Yes?

207
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,840
Desire: It is postulated that thermal contact.

208
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,840
(Postulated = Assumed)

209
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,540
Flesh upon flesh results in a unique exchange of emotions.

210
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,220
(Procreate = Make Love)

211
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,220
I request that you procreate with this unit.

212
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,380
I don't think so.

213
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,060
Alternative: You may take advantage of this unit in any manner you wish.

214
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,980
Though it possess no orifice.

215
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,480
Look I said- wait... No orifice?

216
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,980
[Unload]

217
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,980
Lossen.

218
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,400
Recreational.

219
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,700
First.

220
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,140
Chess.

221
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,800
I request participation in the game.

222
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,840
Condition: If this unit wins, it shall be taken home with you and procreation shall occur.

223
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,820
I can only assume you chose chess on purpose.

224
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,000
You guys are basically walking calculators. So there's no way I can win.

225
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,560
Still...

226
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,900
What if...

227
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,740
I do manage to win?

228
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,180
Answer: You shall take this unit home.

229
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,060
And then immediate procreation shall occur.

230
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,140
-It's the same thing!

231
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,700
Well whatever... Guess there's no getting out of it at this point is there.

232
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,740
Fine I'll play along.

233
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,880
Conclusion: A game in accordance with the aforementioned turns.

234
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,220
Sure. I'll play you one time.

235
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,300
Except, I'll be making...

236
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,960
A slight change to these little rules of yours.

237
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,820
We have arrived.

238
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,380
I'm sold. When it comes to mobility, you really don't use any spiritual energy?

239
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,960
Correct. Utilizing spiritual energy would have saved 55782 seconds.

240
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,640
Amendment: This unit is a proofer, a model primarily used for analysis.

241
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,740
Its capabilities are lesser than other Ex-Machinas.

242
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,660
-With a half-assed race like this waging war.

243
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,300
It's no wonder the world's gone to hell...

244
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,060
What should I call you?

245
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,500
Meaning unknown.

246
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,420
Your name. Don't you have one?

247
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,580
Understood.

248
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,000
Designation number: Üc207Pr4f57t9

249
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,300
That's your name? Forget that.

250
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,960
You're going to need to go with something easier

251
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,540
-Query: If this unit wins.

252
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,020
It will stay with Riku until it is able to fully comprehend the human heart.

253
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,620
Should this unit conceal that it is a machine?

254
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,980
The hearts... like an unspoken feeling that is formed through mutual understanding.

255
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,360
If you're going to be with me. You're going to need to dress like a human.

256
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,180
Query: Is self designation an option?

257
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,320
-Sure, whatever.

258
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,440
Response: I shall be called Schweitzer.

259
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,600
No, that's hard to say, and weird...

260
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,880
Not gonna work for me.

261
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,100
Let's just go with: ShuVi.

262
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,380
All clear: Adjustment was made for self configuration.

263
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,220
-Can we do something about the way you talk before we get started?

264
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,480
Noted: Adopting personality 1610.

265
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,900
Tehehehe, is this better for you Onii-chan?

266
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,900
-Regected.

267
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,160
Setting was most logical choice available.

268
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,200
What logical bull crap did you use to position yourself as my younger sister?

269
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,680
Answer: I merely presented what was the most optimal option.

270
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,540
Yeah, It would be a big problem if people were to start asking about our past.

271
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,060
Just act shy, and don't say more than you have to.

272
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,220
And quit starting every sentence sounding like a robot.

273
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,660
Understood?

274
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,640
Understood.

275
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,240
Something, like this?

276
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,060
Uh, are you, acting or something?

277
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,760
Acting? I'm not.

278
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,180
I have chosen a personality matching the given parameters.

279
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,300
It's a trace emulation.

280
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,840
It'll do.

281
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,000
I want you to stay where I can see you, and keep those clothes on.

282
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,180
Is there maybe something you can do about that tail looking thing you've got there?

283
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,020
Negative, it is Schwi's power source, a nerve core of quasi spiritual circuitry.

284
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,560
Alright, fine I guess. We'll just say it's a fashion choice.

285
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,300
But I'm going to say this one more time.

286
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,620
Do not show that robot body of yours to anyone else, okay?

287
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,300
Yes, I will show it only to you.

288
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,780
She's so cute, who is she?

289
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,500
Yeah I found her on the way back, her colony had been wiped out. She was in a, uh-

290
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,980
So is she?

291
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,260
Your wife?!

292
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,260
His wife?

293
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:29,560
Oh come on, don't be shy. Now your first priority should be having kids, next to spoon and of course having 5 or 6 more kids!

294
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,100
-Could you please cut that out... And that goes for you too!

295
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,820
What does she mean?

296
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,340
She doesn't mean anything.

297
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,000
What's your name?

298
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,480
I am Schwi.

299
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,680
That's a lovely name.

300
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,140
So how did you meet Riku here anyway?

301
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,180
Well he...

302
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,280
He kissed Schwi.

303
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,600
And demanded that the two of us partake in procreation.

304
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,900
She just, uhh...

305
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,460
Riku...

306
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,140
You couldn't wait could you, huh?

307
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,860
Don't you have a shred of decency?

308
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,540
You could have worded that differently you know.

309
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,280
Differently?

310
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,400
Nevermind.

311
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,140
Look, could you at least try to look a bit more mature.

312
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,200
You're making me look bad over here.

313
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,200
Okay. But isn't this the form that you prefer?

314
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,380
Nah, that aint my thing.

315
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,640
Then, what form do you like?

316
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,020
Now you listen here, do you even know what it means when you ask that question?

317
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,200
I'm wanting to know what you prefer.

318
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,580
That's something I can't really tell you with words.

319
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,080
Do you remember how I explained the human heart?

320
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,760
I remember.

321
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,700
So then... Lets play.

322
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,580
No thanks.

323
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,400
I didn't have much choice before, but. I find games pointless.

324
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,660
What if... They are not pointless.

325
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,760
What if, you win?

326
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,660
The prize will be all the information you desire.

327
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,740
For Example.

328
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,800
The reason that the great war began.

329
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,680
And what it will take to end it.

330
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,680
Give me a break.

331
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,600
We humans don't have any choice in that nonsense. There's no point in bothering with it.

332
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,680
There's only one thing I need to know how to do.

333
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,900
How to make it through the day alive.

334
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,320
And that's it.

335
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,440
That's the whole reason I brought you along.

336
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,620
The knowledge, the math, the engineering tech you Ex-Machina contain.

337
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,420
If I can beat you, than that's what I want.

338
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,600
Understood.

339
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,480
Given.

340
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,060
The current state of our world.

341
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,200
The fact that humans have survived is...

342
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,140
An anomaly.

343
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,840
Even we Ex-Machina cannot calculate a reason for this.

344
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,900
As lifeforms, you are weak, your civilization is primative.

345
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,180
You cannot utilize spiritual power, and yet...

346
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,400
You have subsisted.

347
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,280
It defies all reason.

348
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,680
Yet there must be an answer, a key to your survival

349
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,200
And my theory is: That it resides in the human heart.

350
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,520
And I intend to find it.

351
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,560
I, wish to discover-

352
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,100
-Enough

353
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,800
You're so full of shit.

354
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,260
Riku?

355
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,720
You wage war whenever you want.

356
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:40,660
You've taken everything from us. And well... I'm so sorry you're puzzled why we're still alive.

357
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,320
No wonder you know nothing about the human heart.

358
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,560
Okay fine, You want to know?

359
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,840
I've got a feeling my heart hasn't changed one dam bit since the moment I was born!

360
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,920
You can burn in hell, every last one of you!

361
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,080
Do you know how many people have died because of you bastards, you probably know exactly how many don't you!

362
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,140
And how many more will you make us kill?

363
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,700
Riku? I have made you cry.

364
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,520
So therefore, I assume, I have said something terrible.

365
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,360
Something to hurt you.

366
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,020
What I do know about the heart.

367
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,660
Is that deep inside it.

368
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,300
Riku. You can stab me.

369
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,220
I will die.

370
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Rather.

371
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,840
Since I am not a living being.

372
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,540
It will be a permanent cessation, with repair not being possible.

373
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,240
A complete systematic failure.

374
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,740
I wish to know your heart.

375
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,700
That is all, if this is truly what your heart desires.

376
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,860
I want you to kill me.

377
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:04,100
Chad, Anton, Elma, Corey, Dale, Stilith,

378
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,240
Ed, Darrel, Dave, Larcus, Vin,

379
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,860
Eric, Charly, Thomson, Shindt, Yang,

380
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,840
-Riku?

381
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,340
Za Za, Zargo, Craig, Goro, Pita,

382
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,900
Arthur, Mort, Kimi, Dut, Zero,

383
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,320
Vinny, Wally, Kayne, Savage, Rirai,

384
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,240
Bo Bo, Cuton, Lito, Sigure, Xiao,

385
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,220
Wolf, Bard, Aso, Cayde, Yale,

386
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,660
Ahad, Hound, Bando, Masashi, Melagin, Karim,

387
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,380
Ivan...

388
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,800
48 People.

389
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,480
And I'm the one who ordered them all to die.

390
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,860
Too many people have died during your great war.

391
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,820
Removed from this world like dust being swept away!

392
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,020
And the one who sent those people to die.

393
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,420
The one who told them to!

394
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,480
Riku?

395
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,240
Riku? Are you awake?

396
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,560
Sorry, I know you're tired but if you don't mind, I'd a-

397
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,320
Ah, sorry!

398
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,340
Okay, Schwi do you mind if I ask you why you're sitting there, straddling me?

399
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,340
Riku, You instructed me to stay where you could see me.

400
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,020
I only meant for you to stay nearby...

401
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,380
Question: If I'm not in your line of sight, then can you see me?

402
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,100
Is this some sort of roleplay?

403
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,940
-It's not roleplay!

404
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,600
It's okay, Onee-chan understands.

405
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,100
Whenever you're done, let me know if Schwi can take a bath.

406
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,060
Bath...?

407
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,240
Schwi.

408
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,840
Riku said I can show my body only to him.

409
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,360
In that case.

410
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,560
-You have her trained?

411
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,620
Coron, will you please just leave us alone?

412
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,540
You sure are moving quickly, okay I'll let you two have some privacy.

413
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,080
I'll go kick out whoever is in the bath.

414
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,900
I am... sorry.

415
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,640
Sorry for what?

416
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,860
For being the aggressor, and yet asking you about the heart.

417
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,400
It's illogical.

418
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,720
I wouldn't say illogical, it's... insensitive.

419
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,420
My circuits are capable of sensitive transmission.

420
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,660
That's not what I meant.

421
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,560
In anycase, I'm sorry that I got all worked up.

422
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,020
Is that a bad thing to do?

423
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,380
Could be.

424
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,260
I might lose it, smack you. And that wouldn't solve anything, would it?

425
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,800
Do you wish to strike me Riku?

426
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,040
-Of course not, I'm just... making a point.

427
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,840
I... I don't know.

428
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,280
Maybe I'm not so sure myself.

429
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,760
Riku, lets play a game.

430
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,520
Huh?

431
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,020
What did you bring that thing for?

432
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:45,540
Because. That's when you smiled Riku. It's the only time.

433
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,560
So?

434
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,820
Lets, Play a game.

435
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,860
I wish. I wish to know your heart Riku.

436
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,520
But also, not in a manner that hurts you.

437
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,480
I had a conflict.

438
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,640
I don't know what to do...

439
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,800
You mean you would have to hurt me to do it?

440
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,940
Can't you just go back to your cluster?

441
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,920
I'm sure you can learn all you want about the heart without forcing it out of me.

442
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,120
Yes, that's true.

443
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,340
But either way, I do not wish to cause you harm.

444
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Why is that?

445
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,260
You're asking me?

446
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,660
Stating possibility: Answer.

447
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,680
The unit has found the cluster: Pointless, Meaningless and Irrelevant.

448
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,380
When personal analysis of the heart taking prominence. I want you to remain.

449
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,580
Error.

450
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,240
-Stop!

451
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,280
Conclusion.

452
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,220
It seems I don't want. To go back.

453
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,600
It seems?

454
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,240
Unable to quantify indefinitely, although.

455
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,960
It would seem so.

456
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,940
So it does.

457
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,780
It's a little confusing.

458
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,340
Pawn to E4.

459
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,240
Hey, you could at least let me have the first move.

460
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,680
-The next turn is yours.

461
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,900
Also, you're playing while I'm sitting here brushing your hair.

462
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,920
That's not very fair is it?

463
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,420
Why's it so long anyway?

464
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,040
If you would prefer it to be short, I will cut it.

465
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,620
No, you don't have to do that.

466
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,420
You just don't get it do you.

467
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,880
Riku.

468
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,920
Here you go. I have designed a compact telescope.

469
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,660
Look, I told you. I still haven't beaten you at chess.

470
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:16,600
But I, thought this is what you wanted. So I made it for you.

471
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,680
That, is where I met you.

472
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Yeah.

473
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,740
There's something about that place, that's always really bugged me.

474
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,540
But it's so far away that I can't just get up and walk there, can I...

475
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,000
We have arrived.

476
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,380
Well, you sure are the observant one aren't you? hooray.

477
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,660
Have you noticed.

478
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,780
The buildings are all destroyed but.

479
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,820
For some reason the ground here, is mostly untouched.

480
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,480
That would be. Because of the Elves protective magic.

481
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,960
But why let everything get completely wiped out.

482
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,520
Except for this one spot.

483
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,480
To the Elves, this was an important facility.

484
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,740
An emergency shelter, or perhaps... Something else.

485
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,700
Something of more value.

486
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,160
A facility to research and develop. New weaponry.

487
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,360
What the hell is this?

488
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,660
Protective Glyphs of the Old Deus. Kainasu.

489
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,760
Kainasu?

490
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,960
That's the creator of the Elves.

00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,440
You'll be safe if you stay on the western escape route.

655
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,920
Well... Best of luck to you and everything.

656
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,320
-Wha- Wait a second. Riku!

657
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,440
Without you, me and the rest of the camp are doomed.

658
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,160
-Nah, everything's going to be fine.

659
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,520
Because from here on out.

660
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,260
No one else is going to die.

661
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,160
Riku.

662
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,500
Hey you guys!

663
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,620
So what sort of craziness are you two cooking up, huh?

664
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,780
Just a little game.

665
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,260
We're going to take it easy and just pass the time.

666
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,800
As of now, everyone here. Is dead.

667
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,720
We did not make it out of the colony in time.

668
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,680
We no longer exist in this world.

669
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,360
We're ghosts.

670
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,420
The day of the final battle will come.

671
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,640
It's no use in hoping for a future where it wont.

672
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,300
The world is an abomination.

673
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,200
So do we just run to stay alive?

674
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,600
Praying to that last battle, and praying to who?

675
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,520
These god damn butchers who call themselves gods?

676
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,360
Artosh, creator of the Flugel

677
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,060
Kainasu, creator of the Elves.

678
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,840
Ookein, creator of the Dwarfs.

679
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:38,480
All of them claim to be the one true ruler of this world.

680
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,820
Fighting for their precious throne and doing nothing but destroying everything in the process.

681
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,080
These pieces of shit don't deserve any of our prayers.

682
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,440
It's time to open your eyes.

683
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,660
We can no longer rely on hope to save us.

684
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,320
Which is why.

685
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,220
We have to build things up ourselves.

686
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,100
In the end. This world is nothing but a game.

687
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,760
Those butchers are after the Star Grail.

688
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:10,080
A conceptual device said to grant absolute authority over this entire world.

689
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,920
Which is why they have to open themselves to this bullshit where anything goes.

690
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,660
And so.

691
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,460
We're going to make our own rules on our own terms.

692
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,500
And then.

693
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,240
We will win.

694
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,720
Number 1: No matter what, you must not kill.

695
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,220
The heart does not wish for murder.

696
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,200
Number 2: You must let no one die.

697
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,740
The heart doesn't want anyone to die.

698
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,540
Number 3: You must let no one discover you.

699
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,540
If we're discovered, we're dead.

700
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:41,480
Number 4: No tactic is off limits.

701
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,300
Not even the slightest trick will be considered dirty.

702
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,620
Number 5: Those guys rules, mean nothing to us.

703
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,300
The heart doesn't give two shits about their bloody contest.

704
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:56,080
Number 6: Break any of these rules, and you lose.

705
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,340
The heart will gain nothing that gains victory that violates our principles.

706
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,620
That's it.

707
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,760
No we do whatever we want.

708
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,440
We are the ghosts.

709
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:12,320
We will not kill a single member of the other races, including the Old Deus.

710
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,300
And we will not be discovered, we are a phantom.

711
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,220
And we will guide the course of this war to its end.

712
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,140
That will be our victory.

713
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,160
To finally see the end of their god damn war.

714
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,440
Our enemies are gods.

715
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,580
With great tools of violence and despair.

716
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,100
Now, this game was never meant for us to play.

717
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,560
So winning means we must do everything in secret and behind the scenes.

718
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,920
And even if we win, we can have no memory of it.

719
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,520
Because ghosts don't exist. They just vanish Into the void.

720
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,060
Into nothingness.

721
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,840
But know this.

722
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,480
If we can do this.

723
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,820
If we can master this game for real.

724
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,220
And if we can win it.

725
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,000
We can die with our heads held high.

726
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,860
Because we lived the coolest, most badass lives ever.

727
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,880
Okay, if you're willing to play along.

728
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,080
And you're ready to get started, then stay here.

729
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,320
I'm going to be honest with you.

730
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,940
No offense, but I really thought you guys were a bit smarter than this.

731
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,600
A smart man would've left before you finished your little speech.

732
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,000
-Come on now, you didn't really think there were any smart people left in the world did you?

733
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,000
Hey, where else are you ever going to find a bunch of crazier fools than these?

734
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,020
The smart have already chosen death over this place, and yet the smartest ones.

735
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,700
Didn't bother being born.

736
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,740
We did what you asked for Riku, you're the one who chose us, remember?

737
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,960
Yeah, that's the right. The one who leads a bunch of dumbasses is the biggest dumbass of all!

738
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,560
It takes a great fool to know how to not let foolishness get them killed.

739
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:58,940
We have stayed alive in a world where life has no value.

740
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,340
Their science, knowledge, and intellect, and made that happen.

741
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:10,200
They're all fools, incredibly weak and vulnerable.

742
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:14,880
Okay everybody, lets do this, let us pledge upon the wishes of our fallen brothers!

743
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,640
""Ashieit!""

744
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,640
-No.

Not upon the memories of the fallen, but the rules we have vowed to follow.

746
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,700
To everyone here.

747
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,960
I pledge: Aschent.

748
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,960
Okay.

749
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,120
Let's get this game started.

750
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,180
Riku.

751
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,240
I am now certain.

752
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,620
I do not understand the human heart.

753
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,060
All potential strategies have a less than 1 percent chance of success.

754
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,820
And you must wondering why everyone's so sure that we can pull it off.

755
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,160
So Schwi.

756
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,000
If you roll a die, what are the odds it'll come up as six?

757
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,620
A one in six chance.

758
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,420
Yeah, maybe so.

759
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:09,560
But what if someone who doesn't exist swaps it out for a die that will only roll a six?

760
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,280
You're talking about manipulate of the variables.

761
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,640
-Yeah.

762
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,660
I like to call it cheating.

763
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,140
Sounds fun right?

764
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,320
We are the singularity of the equation.

765
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:26,140
We'll make every prediction, every strategy and calculation come together exactly how we want it to.

766
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,700
If we pull it off, it'll be a-

767
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,000
-A miracle.

768
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,540
It would be an anomaly.

769
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,620
Success would be a distortion of probability theory.

770
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,620
I know, anything can happen.

771
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,320
Zero or One Hundred, it doesn't really matter.

772
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,040
I mean, that's why they call it a theory right?

773
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,180
Would you like me to prove it to you?

774
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:50,240
Question: What are the odds that right here and now. I were to profess my love to you?

775
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,100
Intent unclear, estimation near zero.

776
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,540
Yeah, well. You're wrong.

777
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,540

00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,560
You know, the first moment we ever met.

816
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,360
I mean why would you have chosen to play chess in the first place? Right?

817
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:14,660
And then why else would you just be sitting there outside of the settlement?

818
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Wasn't very well thought out was it?

819
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,220
Even if that is so... Why?

820
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,700
Well...

821
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,160
I guess because once I knew the whole story.

822
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,680
I kind of fell for you, what can I say?

823
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,660
Nothing will change the fact that you wiped out my home town.

824
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,040
But if not for that, well then.

825
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,720
We probably never would have met.

826
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,040
It is what it is, we can try and sugar coat it. But it wont change anything.

827
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,580
You can cry, or feel bad.

828
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,180
Or promise to never do it again.

829
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,900
Maybe pity, is why you took an interest in me in the first place.

830
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,660
But no matter your past.

831
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,260
In the present, your with me.

832
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,640
And in my future is where I want you to stay.

833
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,100
It's called: Forever.

834
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,580
Being with you has made me think that, even in a world like this.

835
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,720
I want to live.

836
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,940
It's the only thing that I can think of that makes me want to smile.

837
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,980
So...

838
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,440
Will you throw logic out the window.

839
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,480
And chose to walk this path with me?

840
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,140
That is... As my wife?

841
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,680
Schwi?

842
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,820
In every sense.

843
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,660
To all rational appearances.

844
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,900
It is absurd. And yet.

845
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,400
Let me.

846
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,600
Let me be by your side.

847
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,440
With you, I'll become one, Riku.

848
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,840
And I the same with you.

849
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,800
Riku.

850
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,760
Do you take Schwi to be your wife.

851
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,560
Swearing to grow together, support and love each other, and to stay alive.

852
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,440
Yeah, yeah, I swear.

853
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,920
-Riku, please! You're meant to say Ashieit.

854
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,680
Sorry, we sort of got rid of that.

855
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,760
Now it's, Aschent.

856
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,520
Kind of bugs me that you've been up to all this crazy stuff...

857
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,700
And for not letting me know anything, like what the hell.

858
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:27,120
You all of a sudden you tell me you have a secret hide out and when I get here, you're getting married?!

859
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:31,780
Can we just get on with the stupid ceremony please? You're the one who said we needed it.

860
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:38,180
Do you Schwi, take Riku as your husband, swearing to grow together, support and love each other-

861
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:40,360
-I swear, I swear to Riku.

862
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,760
The one who taught me why I was born, and gave me a heart.

863
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,780
I will not let you die Riku.

864
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:51,340
We will live side by side, right until the end. Aschent.

865
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,680
And so as your new Big Sis.

866
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,880
I would like to congratulate you on your marriage,

867
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,600
-Wait Coron!

868
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,760
You are so cute!

869
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,380
-Coron...

870
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,520
Why are you?

871
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,480
-Well, she is the one you chose to be your bride. Right Riku?

872
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,580
So, in closing. We shall carve your names onto this.

873
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,140
On a rock?

874
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,900
If you guys are going to live in secret, there can be no official documents.

875
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,280
That's your name.

876
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,840
Yes. My surname.

877
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,720
And from now on, it will be the same for all three of us.

878
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,640
Feels weird for us to share a name.

879
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,920
Hey... Riku. Schwi.

880
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,100
I don't know what you are...

881
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,540
Or what either of you are planning to do.

882
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,180
I mean you two aren't really part of this world.

883
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:52,720
But...

884
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:58,220
I do know I have a little brother I adore, and now a gorgeous younger sister too.

885
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:01,380
So... I beg you.

886
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,660
I don't want to lose my family.

887
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,760
Be careful and don't do anything rash.

888
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,220
No one is going to die.

889
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,260
Because this is one game. We're sure to win.

890
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,340
You can trust us, okay? Onee-chan.

891
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:31,020
I can smell it, the black ash.

892
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,440
Well done, Warbeast.

893
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,780
You can eat me if you want. But...

894
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,960
I guarantee you I wont taste very good.

895
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,260
Who the hell are you?

896
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,780
You clan has made the west coast of the continent of Lucia you home.

897
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:49,580
But the Dwarfs are planning to conduct an advanced weapons test out there.

898
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:54,880
And be warned, this thing can even kill an Old Deus. It's a large scale explosive called an Zuibaku.

899
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,920
You kind can use Blood Destruction, yes?

900
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,100
It could prove useful for you to get into the Dwarfs facility.

901
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:06,580
You could make quick work of it. Take care of things however you like.

902
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,320
The Dwarfs fleet keeps close watch on the Warbeasts, and then moves into action.

903
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:17,400
The Warbeasts, fearful of the Zuibaku, flee Lucia.

904
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,600
Next.

905
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,460
Secret Elvish information is leaked to the Dwarfs.

906
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,640
And this...

907
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,400
Is where it all comes together.

908
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:31,780
Who are you?

909
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,000
Let's see...

910
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,340
Let me just call myself, a ghost.

911
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,300
I assume you have business here, that warrants barging into my home, unannounced.

912
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,460
I was thinking the two of us, could have a little game.

913
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,680
A game?

914
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,800
And the currency we'll bet with, is information.

915
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,680
If you win, I'll tell you something. If you lose, you tell me something.

916
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,680
I don't know who you are or where you're from.

917
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,460
And yet you think Nina Clive would just accept a challenge from you?

918
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,740
I'll give you something upfront then.

919
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:06,120
Information on the Arka-shi-anse has been leaked to the Dwarfs.

920
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,400
Is that good enough?

921
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,740
As the advocate and caretaker of Arka-shi-anse Theory.

922
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:15,880
You should have the ability to confirm if this information is valid or not.

923
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,780
Am I mistaken?

924
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,380
Very well.

925
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,400
I may not know who you are, but this is something I cannot ignore.

926
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,660
Therefore here is my wager.

927
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,940
The advocate for Arka-shi-anse Theory is in fact-

928
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,240
-Somebody else right?

929
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,780
Yes, I've already heard.

930
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,860
But I also know, that's not true.

931
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,400
And that you will resort to magic to make me believe your lie.

932
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,140
Now then.

933
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,220
What shall I give you.

934
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,720
When the Dwarfs learned of the Arka-shi-anse.

935
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:55,980
They concluded that it wasn't a threat.

936
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,000
Then I have proof.

937
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,200
But that's ridiculous.

938
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,320
-It's-
It's true.

939
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,880
And I have more information.

940
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:11,120
The Dwarfs are in possession of a weapon of their own. And it's even more powerful than the Arka-shi-anse.

941
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,060
The Zuibaku?

942
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,840
Yes.

943
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:24,120
A weapon of tremendous scale. On that could wipe out the entire continent.

944
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,360
You're saying those creatures who burrow in the earth like moles have created something.

945
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:32,760
Something more advanced than the Arka-shi-anse? The combination of Elvish and Spiritual magic.

946
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,600
Wait just a moment.

947
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:39,400
There have been times that you've chosen to lose on purpose.

948
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,080
Let me ask one last thing.

949
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,260
Are you our enemy, or are you our ally?

950
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,760
I'm neither your enemy nor your ally.

951
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,640
I have but one concern.

952
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:56,000
You only suffer as few casualties as possible.

953
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,700
Very well Ghost-san.

954
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:05,520
To be clear young man, I can assume you have shared this information with me alone, yes?

955
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:14,660
And Ghost-san, I guess I should tell you. My name is not Nina Clive.

956
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:19,680
Rather my name is Sink Nirvalein.

957
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,460
Did I fool you? Or did you already figure it out?

958
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:28,400
Did you ever hear me once call you Nina?

959
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:38,580
Course, if you know anything about me, I'm going to make you regret ever trying to make me your play thing.

960
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,820
After all, the rumor that Elves are relentlessly tenacious .

961
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:46,420
First began with none other than the Nirvalein family.

962
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,460
Riku!.

963
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,200
Riku, here! It's a decontaminate.

964
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,480
Riku. You lied to me.

965
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,400
You said that it would be an hour, you've been breathing black ash for twice that time.

966
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,960
I didn't have a choice.

967
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,920
I had to.

968
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:16,380
Or I would have given myself away. I had to do it.

969
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,420
I don't care how smart you are.

970
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:24,020
No one could predict this sort of suicidal behavior right?

971
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:28,320
Riku.

972
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,580
Looks like this may be it for me.

973
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,580
So...

974
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:39,220
How much longer do you think I've got?

975
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:41,640
I wont let you die.

976
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:45,780
You have to stay alive, until I die.

977
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,600
And how long do Ex-Machina live?

978
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:54,040
I have another 892 years of my service time.

979
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:58,440
Guess, I'll have to step up my game, wont I?

980
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,940
And so the first objective was achieved.

Moving the violent battle lines outside of the Human territories.

982

Look at this, first the Dwarfs, and now the Elves.

983
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,660
Even the Warbeasts are leaving in droves.

What's going on.

985
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,560
Lily, keep an eye on things for me, I'll be back.

986
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,520
Hey! Coron!

987
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,400
The Ghosts continued to take action from behind the scenes.

988
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,940
And just like we wanted.

989
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,280
The Elves eventually became allies with the Fairies.

990
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:39,340
And moved to ramp up their contracts with the Draconia, in order to fend off the Dwarfish fleet.

991
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,420
Meanwhile the Dwarfs became allies with the Gigants

992
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,800
As well as several Phantasma, who were all on friendly terms.

Manipulated by the Ghosts information.

994

Each of the major powers took steps to guard against the large scale destructive weaponry of the others.

995
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,840
Moving their headquarters to the neighboring continent of Ariela.

996
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:05,260
And well that just so happened to be the home base for what was currently the greatest threat of all. The Lord of the Flugel, the Old Deus.

23 units are now installed.

That leaves, 9 remaining.

1002
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,060
And so. As each of the other races sought to take advantage of this situation.

1003
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:28,120
The clock began ticking down to the worlds final battle.

1004

Exactly like we wanted.

1005

Hey Schwi.

1006
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,040
Is there a god of games?

1007
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:45,460
And if uh- If I told you I've met him, would you belive me?

1008
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,300
The stuff he does, it's way beyond anything I can anticipate.

1009
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,300
So of course, I lose to him every single time.

1010
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,960
And yet. It's so much fun that I can't stand it.

1011
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,260
And it's like, I just know that I can beat him the next time.

1012
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,840
I've been thinking about that since this whole thing started, and I have to do it.

1013
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:08,280
I have to settle things with him once and for all.

1014
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,660
Because that game of ours.

1015

I believe it too.

1018

If you say he exists, then he does.

1020

It's just like you said, we haven't lost a single person to the war.

And sightings of the other races have dried up too.

Yeah, I bet.

Well, if you two are the ones who's behind all this.

Then I'd say, you are doing something pretty amazing.

But dammit Riku...

Look at the shape you're in. You need to be more careful.

It's not a problem.

Listen to me Coron.

Do you know what the gods are after with this war of theirs?

The role of the One True God.

1040
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,680
Yep. According to Schwi.

1041
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,980
It's something they refer to as the Star Grail.

1042
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:47,440
Only one of them can be called God. And it was designed so that out of all those fancy Old Deus idiots.

1043
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,060
It's a kind of conceptual device

1044
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,960
Conceptual device?

1045
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,580
How are you ever supposed to find something like that.

1046
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:57,560
The Star Grail will appear only under one condition.

1047
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,800
It must manifest itself in front of the absolute greatest power on the planet.

1048
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:06,300
And if there are 10 gods of equal power.

1049
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:10,200
They will eventually kill all the other 9.

1050
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,400
That's their twisted way of thinking.

1051
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,900
Then they're morons!

1052
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:17,880
So, that's the reason that we've been-

1053
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,760
-Coron, they're even dumber than you think.

1056

They're powerful enough on their own.

1061
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,020
But when put together in one area.

1062
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:45,440
They could blast a hole, right through the planet.

1063

-Huh? The planet?!

1064
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:50,040
All the Old Deus were originally born from this world.

1065
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,800
They all came from the Spirit Circuit.

1066
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:56,560
Which means the greatest power in the whole wide world is actually.

1067
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,580
The spirit circuit...

1068

We may be the weakest, but we've set the stage for final signal.

1069

We're going to use their own strength against them.

And turn the global balance of power, on it's baffled little head.

The Star Grail will appear and once it is acquired. The One True God will be named. And the planet will be rebuilt.

1072
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,520
This operation will be an all out assault.

1073
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:23,500
So it must be done using Schwis' weaponry. Which can skew power directionally.

It will be an amalgam of influence. Installing 32 Eensweg units should in theory.

If my Schwi is gone, then what's the point anymore.

1289
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,160
I have nothing left...

1290
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,340
Spieler Riku.

1291
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,340
[The one who wills it.]

1292
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,560
Who are you?

1293
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,340
I have no name.

1294
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:58,700
But I shall call myself: Über-Ein.

1295
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:03,540
I am here to fulfill the wish given to me by the prayer, the deceased called: Schwi.

1296
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:05,720
Schwi?

1297
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:12,440
Rule Number 2: You must let no-one die.

1298
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,900
The rules you came up with.

1299
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,820
The conditions of failure.

1300
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:20,400
They do not apply to the loss of a tool.

1301
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:25,420
They do not apply to the loss of Schwi.

1302
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:29,020
This makes, check.

1303
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:35,380
The rest, is up to you.

1304
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,300
Allow me to provide you with some additional information.

1305
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:47,140
First off, given that the various races have gathered near the Eensweg installation points.

1306
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:47,140
[One-Way Traffic]

1307
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:53,720
Any movement on our part will be immediately detected by the cluster. With a 98 percent probability that we will engage in battle.

1308
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:58,320
Thus, only the 24 Eensweg currently installed can be used.

1309
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:58,320
[One-Way Traffic]

1310
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:05,320
Meaning it will not be possible to draw the energy downward and into the planet.

1311
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:09,480
However it will be possible to guide the energy south-west.

1312
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:18,680
Second, we Ex-Machina are able to deploy weaponry. And this weaponry can be used to analyse and replicate any attack that is incurred.

1313
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:23,480
[The one who wills it.]

1314
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:23,480
Spieler Riku. You will take control of this weaponry and use it to drill into the planet.

1315
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:27,960
Allowing you to manifest the Star Grail.

1316
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:33,980
Ex-Machina are but machines, mere tools bereft of heart.

1317
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:33,980
(Bereft = Devoid of)

1318
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:38,140
We are designed to complete a purpose. And must carry out the orders we are given.

1319
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,760
As such, now Spieler Riku.

1320
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,760
[The one who wills it.]

1321
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,740
I shall aid you in your purpose. Your orders please.

1322
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:49,800
Schwi...

1323
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,380
The rules, did not include...

1324
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:58,540
The loss, of a tool.

1325
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,600
Schwi...

1326
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:04,200
If this is what you wish.

1327
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,840
Then I wish it too.

1328
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:11,320
That is just cute! Nya.

1329
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:14,420
I never was a fan of the whole healing procedure. Nya.

1330
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:18,740
It has been such a long time since I've seen you like this Jibril.

1331
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:22,680
But I can't still help but wonder what the piece of junk was up to.

1332
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,520
Detecting multiple heat signatures from the outside. It's-

1333
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:37,920
What is going on here, who had the nerve to launch Heavens' Strike. Nya.

1334
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:43,140
We've confirmed the preemptive strike originating from Avantheim. Prepare to launch the Zuibakus.

1335
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:46,940
Fire the Arka-shi-anse. Maximum output!

1336
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,420
Aim for Artosh to Starbord and the Dwarfish fleet to the Port.

1337
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:54,560
A preemptive strike from Avantheim?

1338
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,480
No... This is...

1339
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:03,040
Nya... Those mechanical Nyonsters are thumbing their noses at us.

1340
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,760
Piles of scrap!

1341
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,280
Artosh-sama?

1342
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,700
I've grown tired of this charade.

1343
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:33,440
And now I must respond. A beam of all my power shall confront the attacks of the weakest.

1344
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,120
Yes, you... Monkey.

1345
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:44,520
The Heavens' Strike came from behind Avantheim. Fired in a way so that no one was killed and as a result.

1346
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:48,620
Cluster 11 is now in motion. Headed for point Z.

1347
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:52,400
All out war is on the verge.

1348
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,300
Take your positions.

1349
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,880
We're going up against an Old Deus.

1350
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:02,320
He will see right through whatever plan we humans come up with.

1351
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,760
And be assured, he will bring everything he has to wipe us out.

1352
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:10,140
That's how the powerful think. It's how they do things.

1353
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:19,160
The foolish will not know in which they are mindless apes in worth less than the dirt in which they hide.

1354
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:28,300
You can struggle, but you will know that no matter how many of you band together and writhe upon the earth. You are no strength of the Heavens.

1355
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:31,480
Fire the Arka-shi-anse. Maximum capacity!

1356
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,060
Launch the Zuibakus!

1357
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:36,380
Heavens' Strike!

1358
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:54,280
Even the combined power of the Arka-shi-anse and the Zuibakus could not stop the envoloping fury of Artosh's Heaven's Strike.

1359
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:58,680
All of that energy will collide and build into a raging blaze.

1360
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:02,220
Because of the brilliant light, this signals the end of this world.

1361
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,140
And then.

1362
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:22,200
It's turning away.

1363
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:29,260
All that energy.

1364
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:33,920
We are machines, tools bereft of heart.

1365
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,680
We have lived here yet never alive. Let us die having lived!

1366
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,420
Aus. "Jawohl!"

1367
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,420
[Out, Yes]

1368
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:53,140
Cluster 11 has incorporated 4807 units. And calculated aberration and replication, synchronizing.

1369
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:55,220
[Unload]

1370
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:55,220
Lossen

1371
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:03,880
Orig. 0000, Stale-Mater. It's entrusted to you

1372
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,960
Okay then.

1373
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:19,160
That makes this a draw.

1374
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:21,700
A Stale-mate.

1375
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:27,340
Sorry all you so called gods.

1376
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,720
The Star Grail.

1377
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,020
How many people, have died for this moment?

1378
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,260
Schwi's comrades.

1379
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:17,100
Life after life.

1380
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,900
How many...

1381
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:22,120
How many people have I sent to their deaths?!

1382
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:29,560
What have I done, I was nothing but a fraud. A con artist, gambling with Schwis' spirit.

1383
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:34,240
No I can't take it. I can't do this.

1384
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,600
This can't possibly be a draw!

1385
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,760
Schwi!

1386
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:49,380
I'm sorry... Schwi.

1387
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:51,140
I lost.

1388
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:52,900
Hey Schwi.

1389
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:55,160
If it can only be you and me.

1390
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:57,560
The two of us, together again.

1391
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:01,760
The next time for sure though. I know we're going to win Schwi.

1392
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:06,100
I know exactly how we can win the next time around.

1393
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:12,220
Oh God of the Game! My life is worth nothing now!

1394
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:15,720
But I'm offering it to you. And for the first time in my life.

1395
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,640
I pray to you!

1396
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:25,560
I'm begging you! That even if a loser and a cheat. Someone who would steal and fall into disgrace. That even if these hands are stained in blood.

1397
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:31,460
Please. Please say it all meant something, that we meant something!

1398
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:36,520
Anyone... Please tell me you can put an end to this war!

1399
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:42,260
Please... Take the Star Grail.

1400
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:54,960
The hell?

1401
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:57,440
So you were real after all...

1402
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,420
Hey.

1403
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:01,740
Let's play another game.

1404
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:04,780
This time I'll show you that we can win.

1405
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,460
Schwi and I.

1406
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:11,320
Count on it.

1407
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:28,120
When I was a child, I thought the world was a much, much simpler place.

1408
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:30,340
I thought that there was no challenge unbeatable.

1409
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:34,840
That if I tried hard enough, anything was possible.

1410
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,680
I thought I was seeing the world with clear eyes.

1411
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:42,260
Maybe I was.

1412
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:56,640
Check Mate.

1413
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:59,200
Right Riku?

1414
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:08,380
If things are going well, do you think you could move the white rook to E6 for me?

1415
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:10,040
Coron Dola.

1416
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:11,400
Or I mean...

1417
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:13,220
Nee-san.

1418
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:17,140
I'll leave the rest to you.

1419
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:20,740
That you so much. For everything.

1420
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:25,200
Riku, Schwi-chan.

1421
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,300
You two did something truly incredible.

1422
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:31,520
You put an end, to the eternal war.

1423
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:33,800
And yet...

1424
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:37,460
Why do I feel like this?

1425
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:41,780
Why is it that I feel so... Why do I...

1426
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:46,140
Why do I feel so cheated.

1427
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,640
The game isn't over yet you know.

1428
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:56,540
That may very well be check, but it's not check mate.

1429
01:36:57,660 --> 01:36:59,900
Still if something doesn't change.

1430
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,940
Then we'll be locked in a perpetual check.

1431
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:09,200
This is a first for me you know... It's ended in a draw.

1432
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,340
No one created you.

1433
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:18,580
No one wished for you.

1434
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:21,180
And no one asked for you.

1435
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:26,120
Purely of your own will, you went from beasts to walking on two legs.

1436
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:30,620
Attaining knowledge and becoming what you are today. A nameless race.

1437
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:35,160
But I, the one true god. Shall give you a name.

1438
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:38,200
Immanity.

1439
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,480
And so.

1440
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:45,360
To all exceed, the self appointed sentient races.

1441
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:49,360
First, there was Ashieit, to honor the fallen.

1442
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:52,900
Then Aschent, for consent between a races.

1443
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:55,320
But now you will use Aschente.

1444
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:59,520
As of this day, the world will be forever changed!

1445
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:03,640
Now lets keep this game going!

1446
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:19,260
So about that story, how much of it was true and how much was complete garbage? des.

1447
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:25,200
Oh Izuna, if I told the whole truth. It wouldn't be an unspeakable myth now anymore would it?

1448
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:28,720
You can be a real jerk, you know that? Des.

1449
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:33,020
But while, I like having you pet so I'll forgive you.

1450
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:34,580
Izuna!

1451
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:36,520
Izuna-tan.

1452
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:40,480
Sora, Shiro, Steph-kou.

1453
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:43,900
Oh jeez, where the heck did you go?

1454
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:47,600
You really gotta look out, there's a bunch of creeps out there you know.

1455
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:49,960
-Someone like Nii, or someone like Shiro?

1456
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:52,380
You meet me and just took off moron... des.

1457
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:58,460
They're absolutely right Izuna, there are no creeps in this entire world worse than these two right here. ah-

1458
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:03,520
Oh my god, what are you doing?!

1459
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,280
What is that writing?

1460
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:09,140
Jibril.

1461
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:11,580
Hi. Hello hello!

1462
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:12,840
Can you read this?

1463
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:17,380
Oh it's an ancient language from way back before Immanity became one of the races.

1464
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:21,360
-Come to think of it, most of our problems are usually this idiots fault, des.

1465
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:26,060
It says, Coron Dola, Riku Dola and Schwi Dola.

1466
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:27,480
Coron Dola?

1467
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:30,200
Yes, she was the ruling Queen of Elchea.

1468
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:35,360
She was smart and full of joy, and a bright soul who was never ever seen crying.

1469
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,280
She was the pride of the Dola family.

1470
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:39,180
And who are the other two?

1471
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:42,160
Um, I have no idea.

1472
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,740
Schwi...

1473
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:47,980
The little creature was no apart of Immanity

1474
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:54,260
I feel like I've heard that name before, des.

1475
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:57,500
At least. I think so.

1476
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:03,660
As it turns out, the world really isn't all the complicated.

1477
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:06,860
It's pretty simple actually.

1478
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:10,700
It's all just a game, a very simple game.

1479
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:13,160
Of course, some will try to make it difficult.

1480
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,560
But you can handle them, I know it.

1481
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:18,000
I know you can!

1482
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:32,660
Now...

1483
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:38,480
-Let's get this game started!
