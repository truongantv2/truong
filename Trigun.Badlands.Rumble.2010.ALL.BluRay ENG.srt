1
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,743
Emergency! Emergency!

2
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:36,538
We got a tipoff about a
bank robbery in Bocci City!

3
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:40,875
Huh? Well, good luck!
Let me know if you capture them.

4
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:44,754
This is no ordinary robber!
It's him! Gasback!

5
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:45,880
What?!

6
00:00:45,964 --> 00:00:50,218
Send backup right away! We need
a squad... no, two squads at least!

7
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,387
I'll send in a platoon!

8
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:02,397
A struggle over resources! In the end,
life is a struggle over resources.

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,565
--Move it!
--Ugh!

10
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:06,234
“Hey!
“OW!

11
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:15,076
Moving things from there to here,
and from here to there.

12
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,581
Everyone's obsessed with
their share. Isn't that right?

13
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:23,168
That's not true! What we have here
is the result of everyone's hard work!

14
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:27,380
Same difference.

15
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:31,009
You just happen to have
enough resources in your town.

16
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:35,054
You just don't realize that you
took those things from other places.

17
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:37,015
Now, I'm not criticizing you.

18
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:41,895
I told you, didn't I?
Life is a struggle over resources.

19
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:47,692
Men, women, old timers and
little brats... Anyone can take part.

20
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:55,074
Caine, isn't it about time

21
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:59,788
you did something about your habit
of stealing in petty and sneaky ways?

22
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:04,209
Stealing all sneaky like that
is no good. It doesn't suit me.

23
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:06,711
Also, swindling is
out of the question, too.

24
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:09,047
That's not something humans should do.

25
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,425
That being said,
legit businesses are worse.

26
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:13,426
Why is that?

27
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,013
Because you can't see the faces
of those who you're stealing from.

28
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:21,100
I can't see their astonished faces
as they watch me walk off, right?!

29
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:24,979
It's not a struggle if we
aren't face to face like this.

30
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:26,898
Boss! We're ready to start!

31
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,399
Yeah!

32
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:30,461
This bank is finished... they say
that once Gasback's done breaking in,

33
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:34,215
the place doesn't have
so much as a weed left.

34
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,969
But it depends on
how you look at it, sir.

35
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:42,348
If we don't resist,
at least we can survive.

36
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,392
You, too. Cheer up.

37
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,478
See that? If this wasn't Gasback

38
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:51,649
but that Humanoid Typhoon,
Vash the Stampede, instead,

39
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:57,614
forget weeds, there wouldn't even
be a single hair from our heads by now.

40
00:03:57,697 --> 00:04:00,074
Yeah, that's true.

41
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,078
I see... This is better than
being attacked by him, huh?

42
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,706
We're lucky that it was Gasback.
We're lucky that it was Gasback.

43
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:09,375
We're lucky that it was Gasback.
We're lucky that it was Gasback.

44
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,420
The last piece...

45
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,617
I really like the look
on your faces. I'm satisfied.

46
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,118
Hey, Caine! Aren't we ready yet?

47
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:47,246
This is the last one!

48
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,751
Looks like it's time to say farewell.
I hate to go, but we've gotta split.

49
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:59,217
We're leaving you here, Gasback.

50
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,930
It didn't go off by accident, did it?

51
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:08,142
That gunshot was a message that
this is the last job we do with you.

52
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,394
Oh?

53
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,688
We're fed up with you!

54
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:15,316
All you do is go after
big prey like some idiot.

55
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,903
We go to a lot of trouble to steal money
and yet you put it into the next job.

56
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:21,906
You were just gonna do the same
thing this time too, weren't you?!

57
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,868
That's what a robber lives for, isn't it?

58
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:28,538
What's the point in being a robber
if you don't take it seriously?!

59
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:32,583
Give me a break! Why would I become
a robber if I want to work seriously?!

60
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,085
Th-That's right!

61
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,336
I see.

62
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,840
So you egged on those two airheads, huh?

63
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:42,176
We wanna live the good life while
doing as little work as possible.

64
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,512
As of today, you're no longer our boss!

65
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:49,851
Oh yeah? I've been getting
fed up with your petty nature, too.

66
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,602
Well, would you be a
little surprised if I told you

67
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:54,605
that the police have already been
tipped off about tonight's job?

68
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:55,732
Hm?

69
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,693
Don't worry. We'll take the treasure, too.

70
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:01,029
We'll blow your corpse to smithereens!

71
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,031
If you think you've got what
it takes to take me down...

72
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:08,453
Oops. I thought you'd have noticed by now!

73
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:12,957
It's a piece of cake to kill
you when you're unarmed.

74
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,084
Goodbye, Gasback.

75
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:18,921
Humph. You're the one who'll be
finished when you pull that trigger.

76
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,423
You're bluffing.

77
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,925
Then, go right ahead.

78
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:24,844
You son of a...

79
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,525
Don't shoot, unless you
want to shoot your buddy!

80
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:44,614
There! I don't know what's going on,
but it looks like luck is on my side!

81
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,748
Ow! Ouch!

82
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,833
Stop it! Hey!

83
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:01,255
Stop it!

84
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,384
Calm down! Calm down! Hey!

85
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:08,221
"Calm down"? I am calm...

86
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:13,351
calm enough to be able to blow
your brains out with one shot, at least!

87
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,644
Hm?

88
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,395
Hm?!

89
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:19,107
Please don't!

90
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,611
L-I was wrong! Please forgive me!

91
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:27,865
You did the worst possible
thing you could do to me.

92
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:32,370
You made a disgrace
of my robbery! My robbery!

93
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:39,001
Too bad... If I blow your brains out,
I won't be able to see your lifeless face!

94
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:41,129
Ahhhh!

95
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,297
My donut!

96
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:48,094
Hurry! Hurry up and
move your foot! Hurry!

97
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,267
My donut...

98
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,852
Hey! How cruel of you!

99
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:59,063
I saved the last piece and was looking
forward to eating it all this time!

100
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:01,440
Now that it's like this,
I can't eat it anymore!

101
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:03,025
You wanna die? Don't wander around!

102
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:06,362
You guys're the ones who
barged in and dragged me into this

103
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,072
when I was about to eat my donut!

104
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:10,825
You tied me up and left me
on the floor! This is terrible!

105
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:14,162
Did you hit your head or something?
Or are you always like that? Or are you...

106
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:15,705
In any case, give me back my donut.
Give it back!

107
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:20,418
Shut up! If you're gonna be in my way...

108
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:20,918
Give it back!

109
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,379
What the hell's your problem?!

110
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,924
Give it back!

111
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,343
--Give it back!
--Get off of me, you idiot!

112
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,180
Give it back!

113
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:36,058
--Hey!
--Give it back!

114
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:42,690
Can't be...

115
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:48,613
A grudge over food is a frightening
thing, according to the Zipanese.

116
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:52,867
Shut up. I'm thinking about
what I can steal from you right now.

117
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,660
That's Vash the Stampede!

118
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:55,369
Hm?

119
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:57,205
Ahhh! Help!

120
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,706
Shut up!

121
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,374
If you keep talking nonsense,
you'll be the first to...

122
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,792
Give it back...

123
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,087
--Ahh! It's Vash!
--We're done for!

124
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,423
I don't wanna die!

125
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:15,181
Could it be that you're the
one who's been interrupting?

126
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:20,186
What the hell's your game?
You saved me, and then you saved them.

127
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,731
What do any of us have to do with you?

128
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,859
Because... well...

129
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:29,403
isn't it better if everyone's alive?

130
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:32,949
I can't believe I'm hearing that
from The Humanoid Typhoon.

131
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:36,744
Well, you know...

132
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:40,081
I don't think it's a good idea.
Even if it's just a single life,

133
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:44,252
giving something is
against the way of the world.

134
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:47,964
But you can't just take
it away now, can you?

135
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,925
That's right. Once the die's
been cast, there's no going back.

136
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:51,717
Huh?

137
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,971
And you rolled someone else's die.

138
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:58,432
I hope you won't regret it.

139
00:09:58,516 --> 00:09:59,767
Well then, see ya.

140
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,977
Huh?

141
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:19,078
Isn't that overkill?

142
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,791
Huh?! Don't tell me you...

143
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:27,920
Hm?! "Don't tell me..."?
You mean the plant?!

144
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:29,755
Looks like it's okay.

145
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,965
More importantly, look.

146
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,092
Huh?

147
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,677
This is a big problem!

148
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,304
See ya.

149
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:38,848
Ugh!

150
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,358
Hm?

151
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,570
What?! I'm the mastermind?!

152
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:12,840
<i>Clad in a red coat that
ﬂutters with the burning sand...</i>

153
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:17,428
<i>he is the devil's messenger,
a man who reduces cities to ashes.</i>

154
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,350
<i>Vash the Stampede.</i>

155
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:25,603
<i>An outlaw with $$60 million on his head...</i>

156
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,774
<i>The man who was called
"The Humanoid Typhoon.“</i>

157
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:36,030
Getting older hasn't changed him one bit.

158
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,656
He kept a low profile for a while,

159
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,159
but he's now an outlaw with
$$100 million on his head, huh?

160
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,078
It went up this morning.
It's now $$300 million.

161
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:43,871
$$300 million?!

162
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,706
Now I feel like I wanna go after him, too.

163
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,167
Sounds good.
Only your head will come back.

164
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,378
What? What about you? Can you do it?

165
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,963
I wouldn't even try in the first place.

166
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:09,397
Whoa... How gaudy.

167
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,110
Mr. Kepler reorganized
Macca City's plant 20 years ago.

168
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,153
He spent five years building it.

169
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:18,614
To think that he built his own bronze statue...

170
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:22,076
It sounds like he's someone
who's tough to deal with.

171
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,996
I'm sure we'll be fine...
since we got a gift for him.

172
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,126
Yeah. On top of that,
it's bigger than our usual ones.

173
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:54,024
Hey ladies. If you're not busy,
why don't you come join us for some tea...

174
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,526
with some alcohol in it?

175
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,653
No thank you! Plus, we are busy!

176
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,698
Hey, hey, hold on a sec. It couldn't
hurt to spend a little time with us, right?

177
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,785
Come with us. You too, tall lady.

178
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:05,953
Okay?

179
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,247
Ahhhh! Ouch!

180
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,084
Oh my... I broke another sling.

181
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,173
Hey! What're you doing?!

182
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:22,970
Well, sorry about that. Looks like you
started off with a rough greeting, huh?

183
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,307
Why are the bounty hunters gathering here?

184
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,767
Haven't you seen this?

185
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:29,977
This is...

186
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,064
There's a rumor that Gasback is
planning to strike here, Macca City.

187
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:37,693
So Mr. Kepler is gathering
them in lieu of bodyguards.

188
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,112
Ma'am?

189
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:46,035
I now know why headquarters told us
to go confirm the insurance contract.

190
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:49,997
The insurance payment for
that bronze statue is $$5 billion!

191
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,081
5 billion?!

192
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:55,711
We, the Bernardelli Insurance Society,
are on the verge of extinction!

193
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:38,796
You bastard! How dare you...!

194
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,881
Okay, you're done. I'm next.

195
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,801
That's 75 cess.

196
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,845
--Smoked thomas, pl--
--Hey, give me some smoked thomas.

197
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,764
Sir, please wait your turn.

198
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,683
Hurry up. We want 200 ounc of it.

199
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,269
Pay before you eat!

200
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,899
Give us some smoked thomas and sausages.

201
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,613
There sure are a lot of bad
mannered guys around today.

202
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:14,415
Gasback is just a worthless old robber.

203
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:19,503
$$300 million for him, dead or alive...
What a profitable outlaw for us.

204
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,171
Look who's talking.

205
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,425
If you let your guard down,
he'll turn the tables on you.

206
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:29,263
If you're scared, isn't it better
to get off the ship right here, right now?

207
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,266
Right, brother?

208
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,601
Hm?

209
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,936
Are you... a woman?!

210
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,856
Let me see your face.

211
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,150
Don't touch me.

212
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:46,196
Whoa! I found me a
little birdy in a place like this!

213
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,699
Are you traveling by yourself?
Why don't you eat this with me?

214
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,784
Out of my way! Lady. Come over here.

215
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,953
Hey! I found her first!

216
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:56,540
Do you wanna travel with me?
I'm sure it'll be fun, princess!

217
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,667
Whoa... What a looker.

218
00:15:58,751 --> 00:15:59,543
Don't touch me.

219
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,086
Huh?

220
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:01,962
Don't touch me!

221
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:04,423
Huh? What did you say?

222
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,764
She doesn't like you! Sucks to be you!

223
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,308
Didn't you hear when
I said "Don't touch me"?

224
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,811
You're making a big to-do just because
I'm a woman. Are you guys virgins?

225
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,981
Whoa!

226
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:24,318
Boy, you're quite the lively chick, aren't you?

227
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:30,949
I love women like you.
I like forcing them to do what I wan--

228
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:37,206
To think you use sharp objects
on the ship... You've got bad manners.

229
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:38,290
Move!

230
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:41,794
It's too late to apologize now, you bitch!

231
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:48,425
He got kicked twice!

232
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,303
You bitch! Don't screw with me!

233
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:53,013
You want to be kicked some more?

234
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:56,308
I'll shut your mouth!

235
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,396
Your legs have a bad habit of kicking!

236
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,898
Nice!
Go around over there. We'll pin her down.

237
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,566
Got it!

238
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,033
Excuse me, you were using...

239
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:17,579
a knife earlier, weren't you?
Didn't you drop it around here?

240
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:20,165
To tell you the truth,
I wanted to eat thomas meat,

241
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:22,918
but I forgot to bring a knife.

242
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,922
I was wondering if you'd let me use yours.

243
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:31,343
I've killed... tons of idiots like you!

244
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:35,055
Ah! There it is! I found it! This is the one.

245
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:39,560
That man dropped it earlier, right?
I just need it for a little while.

246
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:45,107
I just want to scrape the thomas
meat a little. Can I borrow it?

247
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:48,485
No, you can't!

248
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:53,240
What?! Oh no...!
Then I can't have my snack now?

249
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,658
Then“.

250
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,414
Hey, idiot.

251
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,290
<i>Yes'?</i>

252
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,083
No... You're a super stupid idiot!

253
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,251
Ugh!

254
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,765
Oh, no!

255
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,975
I'm sorry. It was my fault! I apologize.

256
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,435
Shut up! Get off of me!

257
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,146
Don't be like that. Please?
Please? I apologize.

258
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,522
You bastard! Get off of me!

259
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,608
Please... Please settle down!

260
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,276
I got it already! Let me go!

261
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,944
What? Thank you!

262
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:31,945
Ahh! It's not nice to lie!

263
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,447
--How stupid...
--Twice?

264
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,325
--But he drew it.
--Yeah, he did.

265
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:46,877
Both of you... you're not
gonna get away with this...

266
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,587
especially you, bitch!

267
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,047
He fired it.

268
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,131
You gotta be kidding me!

269
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,299
That idiot!

270
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,927
If I remember correctly, you told us
not to touch you or something, right?

271
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,472
I'll make you regret it.

272
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:02,976
I'll put you through hell! I won't
let you off the hook even if you cry!

273
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,563
I'll make you cry and cry,
then I'll make you cry some more!

274
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:10,692
I'll teach you what it
means to make me angry!

275
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:15,614
It means that you're my slave now!

276
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,283
Kneel down.

277
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,743
Tsk...

278
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,787
Kneel down!

279
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,208
I changed my mind!

280
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,181
You shouldn't make such a racket, you know.

281
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:44,518
Besides, you shouldn't fire
your gun on the ship, right?

282
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:59,825
Oh, please stop clapping.
I don't know what to do.

283
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,368
Those guys fired shots, didn't they?!

284
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,244
Hm?

285
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:06,373
Not firing on the ship is
one of the core rules, right?!

286
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,543
We must follow the rules, right?!

287
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,504
Well, please be tolerant here.

288
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,507
You can't oppose it, either.

289
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:21,597
We don't tolerate having guys like you on board!

290
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,890
Here!

291
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,558
Your stuff and guns!

292
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,601
Here!

293
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:28,353
We put food and water in them, too.
You'd better appreciate it!

294
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:32,024
Also... here's your souvenir!

295
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:36,194
If they feel like it,
the caravan will pick you up!

296
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,883
Well then, <i>I'll</i> be going now.

297
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,512
This shows he's quite the
overnight millionaire, doesn't it?

298
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,933
Yeah, even the dangerous aura
of his guards is extravagant.

299
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,616
Thanks for waiting. I'm Kepler.

300
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,953
Ah, yes. Thank you for meeting
with us when you're so busy.

301
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,663
I heard you're from an insurance company.

302
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,123
Yes, you're right, but first...

303
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,626
this isn't much, but...

304
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:39,883
What? Hey! What're you doing?!

305
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,021
No need to worry. It's not dangerous.

306
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,691
I see. Then, dismiss.

307
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:00,278
I'm sorry, but we're in
a state of high alert, so...

308
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:03,657
Ah... yeah...

309
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,702
I guess it's not ready yet.

310
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,287
Reviewing the contract? Why?

311
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,664
Ah, well... uhm...

312
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,374
I thought we decided on the amount

313
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:16,503
after spending enough time to
explain the contents to your company.

314
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,255
Do you doubt our report?

315
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:22,384
Ah, no, but it was still under
construction when we assessed its value.

316
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:29,099
Also, the numbers given before
and after don't quite seem to match, so...

317
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:31,685
It's a symbol of this town.

318
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,687
We can't put a price on it.

319
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,605
Y-Yes, it's incredible.

320
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,691
Then there shouldn't be a problem, right?!

321
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:42,487
By rights, I'd want insurance not just for
the bronze statue, but for the plant, too,

322
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:46,241
since everyone in town, myself
included, depends on it to live.

323
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:50,037
It's like you earn money
without doing anything, right?

324
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,789
I'm sorry, but it's not possible for the plant.

325
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:55,751
It's not something that can be
covered by property insurance!

326
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,544
Our company also cannot...

327
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,880
Yeah, I know.

328
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:02,966
But the insurance amount for the bronze
statue absolutely must remain the same!

329
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,760
Er...

330
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:07,387
Ma'am... Don't we have to assess its value?

331
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:10,307
Our company is the stingiest
of all in the insurance industry.

332
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,060
And yet they thought 5 billion was appropriate.

333
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:16,730
Us trying things now won't make any difference.

334
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,648
Is that so?

335
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:22,027
They didn't send us here to do the assessment.

336
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,781
They sent us as lookouts so that they
won't have to pay the insurance money.

337
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,575
I see...

338
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:32,245
But... wouldn't it be impossible
to steal such a big thing

339
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,540
with so many people around?

340
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:39,419
It's not only a matter
of it being stolen or not.

341
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:43,090
If Gasback appears
under these circumstances...

342
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,599
5 billion would be...

343
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:55,310
Milly! We absolutely have to protect it...

344
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:58,188
if we don't want to depend
on unemployment insurance.

345
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,356
<i>Roger!</i>

346
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:30,762
Hey! Hey!

347
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:33,515
Hey... Let's chat.

348
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:38,979
We didn't talk on the ship at all.
I wanna know more about you, too.

349
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,356
No thanks. There's nothing to talk about.

350
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,067
What?! That's so cold.

351
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,152
Where'd you come from?

352
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,779
What's your name?
Is this your first time in this town?

353
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:51,032
I think I've already said
thank you for saving me.

354
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:52,868
Why are you following me?

355
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:56,997
Because I felt our meeting was fate.

356
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,499
Oh? You didn't feel it?

357
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,667
Stop pestering me.

358
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,837
I felt the thrill on my neck!

359
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,799
I bet you felt it, too. Like this...

360
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:16,850
Quit it already!

361
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:20,145
Please! Tell me your name! Snuggle, snuggle.

362
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:29,404
Are you okay?

363
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:33,116
It's an allergic reaction!
This happens when I touch idiots, like men!

364
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,452
What? Even a nice looking guy like me?

365
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,371
Nice looking? Who?! All men are the same!

366
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:42,292
Then maybe you shouldn't
have come to this town.

367
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:47,714
It's full of stupid bounty hunter guys.

368
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,841
Don't confuse me with guys like them.

369
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:50,717
What?

370
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:54,846
This isn't inside a sand steamer.

371
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:58,850
Er?!

372
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,908
I still really wanna at least know your name.

373
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:18,745
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!

374
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:19,621
Urk!

375
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:22,290
Hm...? What's the matter, Ma'am?

376
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:27,545
I just saw something ominous.
No, it was an illusion... An illusion.

377
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,445
Caine...

378
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:56,449
Idiot! I told you not to come
out without permission, didn't I?!

379
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,785
Is he coming here, too?

380
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:04,291
There's no way that just making
you lose everything would satisfy him.

381
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:11,965
L-I lost everything...

382
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,759
j-just when I was living a good life...

383
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:18,179
Will I be next? Or Mechio?

384
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:21,641
Shouldn't we run awa--?

385
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,560
And leave my current status?!

386
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:28,064
I've finally become this big.
I won't allow him to take it away from me!

387
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,163
Fire!

388
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,593
Stop firing!

389
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:15,904
This is my job.

390
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,197
Hm?

391
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,095
Sorry.

392
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,436
Money! Pay us the rest of the money!

393
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,231
Can we pay in installments?

394
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:54,901
You promised to pay on the spot!
We won't let you get away, Police!

395
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:01,449
You're an excellent bodyguard, buddy.

396
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,369
You're indeed a lucky find!

397
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:14,963
Wh... Why... can't I use... a bill?

398
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,517
Hey buddy, you're in our way.

399
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,062
If you wanna die, go to
the cemetery ahead of here.

400
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:35,066
P-Please... break this bill for me...

401
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,109
Huh?

402
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,194
--Boss...
--Hm?

403
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,660
To think that I didn't take anything.

404
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:49,080
Moreover, that was the
second time I gave something.

405
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,791
That's generous of you.

406
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,962
Go ahead and feel even more indebted.
I've got more big jobs after this.

407
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:58,298
I'll return the favor for you saving me.

408
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:02,677
But like I told you at the start,
I'm not gonna be part of robberies.

409
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,471
No matter what, I'm just your bodyguard.

410
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:07,307
Hey, hey. You fire that incredible gun.

411
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,185
Don't tell me you've never
struggled over anything.

412
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:12,729
I may not look like one, but I'm a clergyman.

413
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:16,649
All I can be part of is people's living
and dying. That's why I fire a gun.

414
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:20,403
Ha! I've never heard
of a clergyman like that!

415
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,950
Going out for dinner?

416
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,369
How about we go together?

417
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:40,423
Hey lady! He)”

418
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,217
Hm? A chick?

419
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,844
No doubt about it. Humph!

420
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:47,263
That won't get her attention.

421
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:49,933
You again? Stop following me around.

422
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:53,686
What? We were on the same sand
steamer and came to the same town.

423
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,272
It's definitely some sort of fate!

424
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:58,525
We should cherish things like that.

425
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:02,153
Then don't you have more in
common with those guys than with me?

426
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:04,948
You came here to claim the
bounty for Gasback, didn't you?

427
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:05,823
Me?

428
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:07,700
You didn't?

429
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:13,248
I just realized... that I came
here to meet you, Miss Amelia!

430
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,043
How come you know my name?

431
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,836
I saw it in the inn's guest register earlier.

432
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,588
What?!

433
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,382
Don't tell me you're staying
in the same inn as mine.

434
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:25,426
Or, more like, the same room?

435
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:30,473
Ugh! It itches!

436
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:32,684
Amelia, my sweetie!

437
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,396
Oof!

438
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,523
Let me try one more time.
You messed up my throw, didn't you?!

439
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,984
It's my turn. <i>I'll</i> take it all.

440
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,736
You're playing dirt)”

441
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,113
--How uncool!
--Shut up!

442
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:46,155
Now... out of my way!

443
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,700
Like I said, let me do it!

444
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:53,580
How about that? Isn't it clear
that I'm the one who'll take it all?

445
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,582
Bingo!

446
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:56,332
I'm quitting.

447
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:58,376
Hey, money! Fork over my money!

448
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,211
What're you talking about?

449
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:11,347
Two people?

450
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:11,973
No, just one.

451
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:14,601
Is it tough to get a quiet table?

452
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:15,518
Pm by myself!

453
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:16,978
Get us two seats in a row, please!

454
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:17,854
Just one seat!

455
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:20,690
Oh wow! What a cow-incidence!

456
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:21,566
Huh?

457
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,651
Do you wanna join u--

458
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,112
This is quite a coincidence!
My acquaintances are here!

459
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,364
They happen to have two seats
available there. Let's go join th...

460
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:31,159
Hey, I'm by myself. Get me a seat.

461
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:38,791
Looks like they're the only available seats.

462
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,627
Cheers!

463
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:48,384
That was the eighth toast!

464
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:53,139
Then you're after Gasback,
too, Miss Amelia? That's amazing!

465
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,808
If you're thinking of getting
life insurance just in case,

466
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:58,936
we've got a simple plan.
Shall I explain it to you?

467
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,521
N-No thanks.

468
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:04,108
Don't even mention things like that.
It's bad luck. She's strong!

469
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:05,735
Right?

470
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,449
So, what about you?

471
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:12,033
<i>Yes'?</i>

472
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,661
Did you come to this town for the bounty, too?

473
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:17,163
No. I just happened
to come here for sightseeing.

474
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,247
Is that the honest truth?!

475
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:19,332
Er?

476
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:22,168
You're not gonna get yourself involved
in this Gasback business, correct?

477
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,587
Well... you know...

478
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:27,382
Don't give me "you know"!

479
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:30,760
Even if you aren't,
the bronze statue crisis is at its peak.

480
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,846
Moreover, The Humanoid Typhoon is--

481
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,520
In any case, would you mind leaving this town?

482
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:43,981
What?! You're asking me that
right after we just got reunited?

483
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,776
In your case, just your
being here attracts trouble.

484
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:50,321
Don't say such cold things.
I'm just here for boring old sightseeing.

485
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,198
I can't trust you.

486
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,451
Who knows.
You might've already gotten into trouble.

487
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,412
Don't tell me Gasback and you are already...!

488
00:33:57,495 --> 00:34:00,665
Geez... I just got into town today.

489
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:05,712
And what're you two doing here?
I haven't seen you girls for a while.

490
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:08,965
Due to company orders, we've had
a change in our immediate priorities.

491
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:10,550
We're here on business.

492
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,844
She's as serious as ever.

493
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,054
Yes! She's very dependable!

494
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:20,226
Geez...
I don't care what you say. Please leave!

495
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:23,020
It's not like I want to,
but after this work is over,

496
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,732
we'll have to follow you around again anyway!

497
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:28,359
What? So you insurance girls are stalkers, huh?

498
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:31,779
Stalkers?! Are we really such bad people?!

499
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:35,575
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow...
What're you doing?! Ow!

500
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:36,993
--I'm taking extreme measures.
--Hey! It hurts! Stop it!

501
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:40,496
--You're probably trying to play dumb and stay in town. But I
won't let you! “Ahhh! Ow, ow, ow... Ah! You're hurting me!

502
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,250
If you're gonna do it, I'll say it! I'll say it!

503
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,169
Ahh! Shut up! Shut up!

504
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:48,379
Va...

505
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:53,968
Vash!

506
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,887
Vash the Sta--

507
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:01,434
You don't care if this town goes into a panic?

508
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:06,272
You wouldn't benefit from it at all, either!

509
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:13,154
Ouch! Ow!
How dare you treat Vash the Stampede like this!

510
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:16,032
You'll pay for this!

511
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,086
Vash? A pitiful guy like you?
Don't make me laugh!

512
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,713
No, he's pretty good!

513
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:33,716
You don't often see someone talking
nonsense like that. He's something else!

514
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,302
Are you babysitting him, lady?
That's a tough job.

515
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:40,932
He must be doing cosplay!
He's dressed like in the wanted poster.

516
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:45,770
Here comes... Vash the Stampede!

517
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,814
Okay, okay! You're the real Vash!

518
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:49,816
You don't look like him after all!

519
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:53,277
Come back after you've
worked on your impersonation!

520
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:55,154
Well, thank you, thank you.

521
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:56,322
Boy, that was a hit, Amelia.

522
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:59,325
Are you a bona fide idiot?

523
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,452
I'm a legendary outlaw
with a big bounty on his head!

524
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:02,870
Oh, I'm scared!

525
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:03,120
There's a limit to how reckless you can be.
Even Gasback is no match to him.

526
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:06,749
To think that no one believes it...
though everything turned out okay.

527
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,544
--But as things stand...
--That was just a joke.

528
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:18,261
Look at that. It's just asking me to steal it.

529
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:21,180
At least it's true that it's really gaudy.

530
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:23,140
Are you really going to
target something like that?

531
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,977
I have to pay its owner back.

532
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:31,858
It took me a while to find his whereabouts,

533
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:38,406
but I'd like to make this robbery
the best one in all my days as a robber.

534
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:41,033
Instead of picking fruit when it's green,

535
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:45,162
you should wait, wait, and wait until it ripens.

536
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:49,542
When they reach their peak, you pick them off!

537
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:54,630
Even though the action itself is
the same, they taste totally different.

538
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:56,799
Robbery is the same.

539
00:36:56,883 --> 00:37:00,803
You take everything when your
target has risen to his highest point.

540
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:05,433
He'll experience a despair that
no one else has experienced.

541
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:09,937
There's no point in robbery if it
doesn't cause any pain. Isn't that right?

542
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:17,737
The world's greatest robbery is out there
somewhere. That's where I'm headed.

543
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,532
I hope you'll come with me all the way, buddy.

544
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:25,870
Our contract says that you'll come
with me all the way to his house.

545
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:28,915
Hmm...

546
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:32,585
I've become indebted to a
troublesome man, didn't I?

547
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:39,050
Hm? You're here again even
though you're a light drinker?

548
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:42,553
Don't tease me. I love the atmosphere here.

549
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:44,972
Then I guess I can't turn you away, huh?

550
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:47,391
Well, give me just one shot.

551
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:48,976
Like I said...!

552
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,103
That bronze statue is having troubles.

553
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:54,774
Gasback is the insurance money.
And our company is done for!

554
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:56,359
I see...

555
00:37:56,442 --> 00:38:01,948
Humph! Gasback is... Gasback is...

556
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:03,866
Bathroom.

557
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,243
See you later!

558
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:07,161
Hey.

559
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:07,995
Hm?

560
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,705
So, what were we talking about?

561
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:13,292
Like I said, that
bronze statue is having troubles.

562
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,586
Gasback is the insurance money. And...

563
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,630
Lady, what'd you just say?

564
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:25,179
Like I said... don't think that you
can get women and money by force.

565
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:29,976
I kinda think that I heard
something like "scum." Did I hear wrong?

566
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,728
Oh, that's a misunderstanding.

567
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:36,691
If it was hard to make out,
I'll say it clearly again for you.

568
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:39,151
Shit bag.

569
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:42,321
What'd you say?! You bitch!

570
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,995
Fig ht!

571
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:51,288
If you're having a fight, let me join you!

572
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:51,914
Hm?

573
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:55,084
Ah!

574
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,044
I'm gonna kill you!

575
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:59,630
Fig ht!

576
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:01,549
You have nothing to do with this! Stay away!

577
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,383
Fig ht!

578
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:04,552
Hey! Stop it!

579
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:21,402
Ma'am...
Looks like there's some sort of trouble.

580
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:23,195
Huh?

581
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,990
You're a marshal.
Don't be entertained by it! Stop them!

582
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:30,286
This is it! This is the saloon!

583
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,413
Hey! Where'd that bitch go?

584
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:37,418
Dammit! Take this!

585
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,172
You bitch!

586
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:49,930
OW!

587
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:51,223
Ouch! Ow!

588
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:53,809
Hey, everyone! Please calm down!

589
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:57,396
Guys! This is a fun
gathering place for everyone,

590
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,399
so let's be friends and have a drink!

591
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:02,234
All right!

592
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:09,950
You bitch! I won't let you get away this time!

593
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:22,213
Huh? Why?

594
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:25,925
The bullets... Where'd they go?

595
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,968
Ah!

596
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:31,555
You bastard!

597
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,515
Those're mine!

598
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:33,974
Give me my bullets back!
Don't steal them, you jerk!

599
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:36,185
What'd you do that for?!

600
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:39,522
Give them back to me!

601
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:50,199
Well... our inn is this way, so...

602
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,534
Okay! See you later!

603
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,285
Good night!

604
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:58,207
It'd be $$5 billion,
our highest insurance payment!

605
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,459
It's tough to be insurance agents, huh?

606
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:04,797
Let me off. <i>I'll</i> walk.

607
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,632
Just pocket your pride.

608
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:10,469
Don't worry. I'm trying
not to touch you directly.

609
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:13,889
When I touch you, it'll be in bed.

610
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:19,645
Hey, did you know...

611
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:25,860
that Gasback was once
cornered and was almost captured...

612
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:28,487
Twenty years ago.

613
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:30,239
I see...

614
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:37,621
He was almost killed by his robber buddies,
but some idiot let him escape.

615
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:41,959
Seriously, it's beyond annoying.

616
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,170
If he had died then,

617
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:47,339
I wonder how many people could
have lived without feeling sorrow.

618
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:51,510
It's like that man was his accomplice.

619
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:56,932
That guy... I'm gonna...

620
00:41:57,016 --> 00:42:02,605
Could it be... that he took
something precious from you?

621
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:07,276
I bet it must have been your first kiss.

622
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,861
--You bastard! You drank my alcohol!

623
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:09,278
--Geez...
--You bastard! You drank my alcohol!

624
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,029
--Like I said, I don't know
anything about it, you idiot!

625
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:14,158
--What did a guy like you come to this town for? --Like
I said, I don't know anything about it, you idiot!

626
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:17,620
Beats me.

627
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:21,248
It's like I'm chasing the die I cast... I guess.

628
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:23,792
Huh?

629
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:27,630
In other words... you and me...
we fell into a love paradise.

630
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,340
You're such a...

631
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:32,259
What?! You're gonna throw up?!

632
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:34,178
Let me know before you throw up, okay? Okay?

633
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:35,137
I'm okay.

634
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:40,226
Really? Then, let's go back to our love nest!

635
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:44,730
Hey! Let me off! Stop! You idio...

636
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:47,983
Ahh! Hold on a sec!

637
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:50,527
Ah... Yikes...

638
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:02,248
Mom, what's that?

639
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:05,084
Hm? It's a precious secret.

640
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:06,794
A precious secret?

641
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:12,424
I'll tell you some day when you're grown up.

642
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:16,595
Mom...! Mom! Mom!

643
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:20,683
I'm sorry, Amelia.

644
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:28,440
I won't be able to be by
your side as you grow up.

645
00:43:28,524 --> 00:43:33,988
The precious secret...
that I promised to tell you...

646
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,781
I'll tell you now...

647
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,324
Mom!

648
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:41,495
Mom... Mom!

649
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:49,378
Mom...

650
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:50,796
Hm?

651
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:56,760
Hm?

652
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:08,230
Hey, you guys!

653
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:10,607
You'd better go easy on drinking.
Or in our hour of peril,

654
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:12,693
you won't be able to do your job!

655
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:15,029
Look who's talking, you good-for-nothing.

656
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:16,905
Let's go back to your office.

657
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:21,076
I'll keep patrolling. I'm the marshal!

658
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:23,787
Are things going smoothly?

659
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:25,539
Oh, good evening.

660
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:28,292
Everything's in good shape.

661
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:32,504
For a town this size, it can probably provide
power for at least the next several hundred years.

662
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:35,299
That's amazing.

663
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:48,645
$$5 billion...

664
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,952
Let's go, guys!

665
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:23,097
It's Gasback!

666
00:45:29,645 --> 00:45:34,233
Cannot confirm your ID.
Leave the premises immediately.

667
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:38,237
If you do not leave within two minutes,
you will be eliminated.

668
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,280
--Ahh, how annoying. --Also, if you have
weapons, you will be eliminated unconditionally.

669
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,991
--Shut up, you pieces of junk! --Also, if you have
weapons, you will be eliminated unconditionally.

670
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:44,493
Eliminate.

671
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:12,980
That's my buddy.

672
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:15,524
You use a strange technique, don't you?

673
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,109
It'll fry you instantly.

674
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:20,988
In order to break through it,
you'll need at least ten lives.

675
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:26,535
Boss!

676
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:29,121
What? Mechio's factory is?!

677
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:32,666
He's asking you to shelter him.

678
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:35,919
Okay. Let him in when he comes.

679
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:58,984
Hey! I heard that
Gasback attacked Denna City!

680
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:00,486
Seriously?!

681
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:05,282
Bang!

682
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:07,618
You... got... me!

683
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:10,329
All right! We brought down Gasback!

684
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:12,539
I was just pretending!
Now for my counterattack! Grrr!

685
00:47:12,623 --> 00:47:14,166
Oh, Mr. Vash!

686
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:15,375
Good morning!

687
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:18,712
Oh? You look refreshed for
having drunk so much last night.

688
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:21,340
We've got some slightly good news, so...

689
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:25,302
We heard that Gasback attacked a
factory in Denna instead of striking here.

690
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:25,886
What?

691
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:28,430
I bet he wasn't after this town.

692
00:47:28,514 --> 00:47:32,601
I thought it was strange for him to
go after such a gaudy bronze statue.

693
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:35,896
Ma'am, isn't that a bit harsh?

694
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:39,483
At any rate, we have to contact
headquarters. Well then, excuse us.

695
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:41,360
Excuse us!

696
00:47:41,443 --> 00:47:44,530
Geez... That stuff about him
targeting this town was false then?

697
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:47,241
We were manipulated, weren't we?

698
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:48,283
Ah!

699
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:52,204
Hey, hey, where're you going?!

700
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:55,207
I'm going to a different
town to collect information.

701
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,293
Gasback targeting this town
might've just been a rumor,

702
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:01,421
or it could've been a false
lead that he, himself, circulated.

703
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:03,465
That's unlikl...

704
00:48:06,218 --> 00:48:11,723
You're right. There's no way he'd
target a remote town like this, huh?

705
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:16,270
See ya. I hope I'll see you again somewhere.

706
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:18,230
What?!

707
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:22,442
You're a bad actor. You still think
that Gasback will strike here, don't you?

708
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:24,653
What?

709
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:27,906
Do you know something?
And why are you trying to get rid of me?!

710
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,075
Well, not really...

711
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:00,981
It's just like him...
gathering a bunch of small fry.

712
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:04,943
But because of that, this
robbery will become quite a show!

713
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:23,086
It's Gasback!

714
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:26,965
Amelia!

715
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:29,343
Dammit! This early in the morning?!

716
00:49:29,426 --> 00:49:30,510
<i>I'll get him!</i>

717
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:34,139
Old geezers sure get up early. What a pain!

718
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:36,642
Out of my way! Gasback is mine!

719
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:38,977
$$300 million! $$300 million!

720
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:40,562
I'm open for business!

721
00:49:40,646 --> 00:49:42,856
--You aren't good enough.
--Gasback is at the front gate!

722
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:45,442
Dammit! My head hurts!

723
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:48,570
Ma'am. He's really here.
What should we do?

724
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:50,030
"What should we do?" you say?

725
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,490
We'll protect the bronze statue!

726
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:54,242
What? We're really gonna do it?

727
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:27,609
--Assholes!
--You'll pay for this!

728
00:50:27,693 --> 00:50:29,444
Stop it!

729
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:42,708
Ma'am...

730
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:44,835
Everyone, listen!

731
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:48,547
We can't let him lay even
one finger on this bronze statue!

732
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:49,297
Who's that?

733
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:50,132
Beats me.

734
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,675
--He's here! He's here!
--I can't just sit here!

735
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:53,427
Hey, aren't we supposed to guard this spot?!

736
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,345
What about the contract?!

737
00:50:56,555 --> 00:50:58,140
Caine!

738
00:50:58,223 --> 00:50:59,933
You're sure we're gonna be okay, right?!

739
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:02,853
I-Isn't it better if we get outta here?

740
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:03,937
Shut up!

741
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:08,567
Unlike your assets, mine aren't small!
I can't just leave them here and run!

742
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:09,985
Are you calling my assets small?!

743
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,571
How much money do you think
I invested in my cargo hovercraft?!

744
00:51:12,654 --> 00:51:15,991
Shut up! Shut up!
He's coming to get revenge on us!

745
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:19,411
He's coming to get payback
for what we did twenty years ago!

746
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:24,916
He'll take... everything...
everything away from me!

747
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,265
My hands went numb!

748
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:28,897
So are you the one who's
been interfering little by little?

749
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,859
What? Little by little?
Did it look like that?

750
00:52:32,943 --> 00:52:34,236
Hm?

751
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,114
The road is closed here.

752
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:39,324
It's you...

753
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:40,659
Ow, ow, ow...

754
00:52:40,742 --> 00:52:43,954
Are you trying to get involved again?

755
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:47,916
Huh? Huh?

756
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:55,131
I don't get it...
but I'm gonna pass through here.

757
00:52:57,884 --> 00:53:01,513
If possible... would you mind leaving?

758
00:53:01,596 --> 00:53:04,015
I've got business with someone inside.

759
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:08,854
By business, you mean killing, right?

760
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:10,522
You could put it that way, yeah.

761
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:13,149
No! Then I can't let you go through!

762
00:53:17,863 --> 00:53:19,489
No, you'll have to let him through!

763
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:20,699
Hm?

764
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:23,827
Wolf wood?

765
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:27,247
Needle-noggin... Give an inch here.

766
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,416
What? What? What?!

767
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:31,835
When did you change your religion to robbery?

768
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:36,172
Don't be silly! I'm doing this out of my
profound obligation as a man. Move!

769
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:40,135
H-Hey, I can't! I can't move! This isn't funny.

770
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:41,887
I'm serious.

771
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,471
Me, too.

772
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:08,872
<i>Ah...</i>

773
00:54:08,914 --> 00:54:11,833
I've completed my contract.

774
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:13,585
Huh?

775
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:15,503
H-He's here!

776
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:37,734
You bastard...!

777
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:44,032
Gasback... Everything is their fault...

778
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:47,285
everything, including
the betrayal twenty years ago!

779
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:51,539
Please...
I punished them for you, so spare me, please!

780
00:54:51,623 --> 00:54:57,796
Don't kill me... Please, please, please!

781
00:54:57,879 --> 00:55:03,093
Caine... you were always irredeemable scum.

782
00:55:03,176 --> 00:55:07,722
But growing older has only made you
worse and worse. You're beyond help.

783
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:09,516
D-Don't...

784
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:11,893
Don't...!

785
00:55:12,394 --> 00:55:14,312
Don't!

786
00:55:28,243 --> 00:55:29,411
Hold on a sec!

787
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:30,286
Gasback!

788
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:32,372
Amelia!

789
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:34,833
This is it. It's over for you!

790
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:38,795
Oh? What a high-spirited girl.

791
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:43,174
It's gotten quiet, hasn't it?

792
00:55:43,258 --> 00:55:45,218
Don't tell me... it's over?

793
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:47,387
Then we were saved, right?!

794
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:51,349
Don't be so overly optimistic!
Don't let your guard down.

795
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:52,559
Yes, Ma'am.

796
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:54,686
Don't try it, lady. You'll get hur--

797
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:56,730
Don't move!

798
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:59,607
Your strange technique won't work on me.

799
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:03,820
Oh? You're quite confident,
but if you wanted to kill me,

800
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:07,198
you should've shot me from
behind without wasting your breath.

801
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:11,828
Without going that far, you can't kill me.

802
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,788
Time out.

803
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:16,708
He and I finally got to meet again,
so give us a little time.

804
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:19,461
Huh?! Hey! Let it go! Stop it!

805
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:24,257
Say, it's been twenty years,
right, Mr. Gasback?

806
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,217
I saw you outside earlier.

807
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:28,344
Oh... you're more detailed than I thought.

808
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:31,306
So you're still screwing around.

809
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:35,143
How come you also look the
same as you did twenty years ago?

810
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:37,062
Well, spirit, maybe?

811
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:38,563
Do you wanna get your finger blown off?

812
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:40,356
--No, I don't.
--Then, let go!

813
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,566
I won't do that, either,
'cause you're gonna shoot.

814
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:43,234
--Of course!
"That's why I won't!

815
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:45,070
Knock it off already!

816
00:56:49,282 --> 00:56:50,658
Dammit!

817
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:56,456
Gasback'll get away, too! Let it go!

818
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:57,207
No.

819
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:59,334
If you don't knock it off already,
I'm really gonna fire the gun!

820
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:01,503
Still no.

821
00:57:01,586 --> 00:57:04,005
Hey, Vash.

822
00:57:04,089 --> 00:57:08,760
Are you trying to save me
again like you did twenty years ago?

823
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:10,095
Hm?

824
00:57:10,178 --> 00:57:14,933
Geez... The Humanoid Typhoon?
You gotta be kidding.

825
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:19,896
Humanoid... Don't tell me you are...

826
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:22,107
Twenty years ago...

827
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,526
The legendary man...

828
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:28,279
Vash, didn't I tell you then...

829
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:31,032
that in this world built on struggles,

830
00:57:31,116 --> 00:57:35,954
I don't think it's a good idea to give
something, even just a single life.

831
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:39,374
Does it look like the die you
cast will turn out to be lucky?

832
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:42,627
I don't know.

833
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:43,419
Well then, see ya.

834
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:45,338
Stop!

835
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:53,680
He ran away, huh?

836
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:59,978
So you were the idiot from twenty years ago.

837
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:04,190
Why... Why did you do such a thing?

838
00:58:04,274 --> 00:58:07,569
You were like that when I met
you the first time, too, and at the bar.

839
00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:09,529
Why?! Is it some sort of religious thing?!

840
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:14,993
Well... they're alive now... It seems
kinda a shame to change that, right?

841
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:21,541
You might be satisfied by saving
people's lives lightheartedly like this,

842
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:25,670
but do you realize that there're
people who're crying because of that?!

843
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:29,090
If you hadn't saved him, there
were people who didn't have to die...

844
00:58:29,174 --> 00:58:33,178
and who didn't have to suffer!

845
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:36,973
My mom... My mom, too!

846
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:46,191
I'll kill Gasback... for sure!

847
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:55,700
You're a pain in the neck, as always.

848
00:58:58,745 --> 00:59:03,291
What can I do... it's my nature.

849
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:06,085
And I'm the one who threw the die, so...

850
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:08,880
You've got the worst throw.

851
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:17,889
There's no way that I'll
give it to that son of a bitch!

852
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,892
The fruit of my twenty years...!

853
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:23,144
We'll see about that.

854
00:59:23,228 --> 00:59:24,812
Caine!

855
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:26,940
Taking just your life

856
00:59:27,023 --> 00:59:31,319
isn't enough to make up for what
you owe me from twenty years ago!

857
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:35,365
I have to take everything from you!

858
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:39,953
I'll show you... the world's greatest robbery!

859
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:49,254
By the plant?! Are you insane, Marshal?!

860
00:59:49,337 --> 00:59:51,923
Boss sure made me do some tiresome things.

861
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:53,841
What?!

862
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:57,053
It was a short time, but I enjoyed it.

863
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:03,893
What'd you do?! What'd you do to my plant?!

864
01:00:03,977 --> 01:00:06,479
Just shut up and watch!

865
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:14,570
Our plant is... Our town is...!

866
01:00:27,417 --> 01:00:29,085
Yahoo!

867
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:31,963
Ma'am...

868
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,506
No way...

869
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:48,521
What the heck?!

870
01:00:48,563 --> 01:00:50,356
It's rolling!

871
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:55,111
Ma'am... what should we do now?

872
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:59,949
Uhm, well... Of course, what else?! Run!

873
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:02,744
"While there's life, there's hope", right?!

874
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:18,343
That was close!

875
01:01:18,426 --> 01:01:20,762
It's not broken, is it?

876
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:36,903
The $$5 billion...!

877
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:46,371
That's the face, Caine!

878
01:01:46,454 --> 01:01:51,417
I wanted to see that look on your face!

879
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:55,171
You made a disgrace of my robbery.

880
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:57,965
This is the price you pay.

881
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:09,268
Boss!

882
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:33,292
Let's beat it! Start the cargo craft!

883
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:41,134
Our plant is...

884
01:02:41,217 --> 01:02:43,469
Does this possibly mean...

885
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:46,931
Our plant has been taken away.

886
01:02:47,014 --> 01:02:47,932
No way...

887
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:50,685
So this is what that cargo craft was for.

888
01:02:56,858 --> 01:03:00,695
It's all over for this town!

889
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:03,281
Amelia!

890
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:04,240
Hey, Needle-noggin!

891
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:05,658
Out of our way! I'm gonna run you over!

892
01:03:05,741 --> 01:03:07,285
We won't let Gasback get away!

893
01:03:07,368 --> 01:03:08,161
Hurry up and go!

894
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:09,120
Let me on, too!

895
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:11,581
We're definitely not gonna let him get away!

896
01:03:17,962 --> 01:03:19,630
You suck at this! Drive better!

897
01:03:19,714 --> 01:03:22,133
You know I'm a lousy driver, don't you?
I can't do any better than this!

898
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:23,217
Let me drive! Now!

899
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:25,303
No! Stop it!

900
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,225
Hey! Look ahead!

901
01:04:21,484 --> 01:04:24,737
Wait! If you end up breaking
the plant, it'll be irreversible!

902
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:28,324
Letting Gasback get away is a
bigger problem! Out of the way!

903
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:57,645
Move!

904
01:04:57,728 --> 01:04:59,313
Don't do it!

905
01:04:59,397 --> 01:05:00,606
Whoa! Are you crazy?!

906
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:03,943
Wait! Wait a sec! Don't do it, Amelia!

907
01:05:04,026 --> 01:05:06,028
Move, Vash!

908
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,741
You, too! Don't interfere!

909
01:05:10,825 --> 01:05:13,869
Even if you say so...

910
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:16,497
Amelia! Cool your head!

911
01:05:16,581 --> 01:05:18,791
Ah! Watch out!

912
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:56,537
Needle-noggin!

913
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:00,374
Tie this to something!

914
01:06:05,087 --> 01:06:06,839
Needle-noggin!

915
01:06:45,336 --> 01:06:47,129
Why...?

916
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:52,051
Why...?

917
01:06:52,134 --> 01:06:55,137
Even though he was about to die,

918
01:06:55,221 --> 01:06:57,890
how could he have that look on his face?

919
01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:10,528
Why...?

920
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:21,455
It looked as if he was saying
"what can you do," didn't it?

921
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:24,208
What's that supposed to mean? Is that all?!

922
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:29,338
He said not to kill anyone
but it's okay for him to die?!

923
01:07:31,006 --> 01:07:33,634
That can't be right.

924
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:46,689
My mom died... because he saved Gasback.

925
01:07:46,772 --> 01:07:48,482
It wasn't just my mom.

926
01:07:48,566 --> 01:07:53,571
There're many other people who didn't
have to cry if he hadn't saved Gasback.

927
01:07:53,654 --> 01:07:58,117
He saved someone he didn't
have to and he died just like that.

928
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,370
Seriously, I don't get it at all!

929
01:08:01,454 --> 01:08:02,913
Is there any point in this?!

930
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:06,751
Is there any point in him dying?!

931
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:15,676
Pretty words... Ideals...

932
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,430
They're all over if you die!

933
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:24,977
Yeah... I feel let down, seriously.

934
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:34,069
Well... he might've been thinking that
if he struggled like that and cast a die,

935
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:37,156
there might be a point in there.

936
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:42,787
No... he might've wanted it to be there.

937
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:46,457
But like you said

938
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,168
if he dies, he can't cast the die anymore.

939
01:08:53,005 --> 01:08:55,090
Ow, it's hot.

940
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:13,776
Nothing works without the plant!

941
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:15,152
All the electricity's gone!

942
01:09:15,236 --> 01:09:16,529
Is the water gonna last?

943
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:19,281
Without the heater, the
old folks at my place will die!

944
01:09:19,365 --> 01:09:22,910
Calm down! We've asked
the neighboring town for help.

945
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:24,453
We're considering renting a plant, too.

946
01:09:24,537 --> 01:09:25,996
We're having trouble tonight! Tonight!

947
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,957
I know! But the water comes first!

948
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,875
We can't even get water
without a plant, can we?!

949
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:32,253
Say, please! Help us!

950
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:36,006
One of my children just had surgery
and his breathing machine has stopped.

951
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:38,133
My husband and the others
are working to keep it going,

952
01:09:38,217 --> 01:09:41,470
but who knows how long they can last...

953
01:09:41,554 --> 01:09:42,805
Big brother is...

954
01:09:42,888 --> 01:09:46,517
Dammit! That damn Gasback!
I never thought he'd steal our plant!

955
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,646
As things stand, the town will collapse.

956
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:54,650
Wait! If you end up breaking
the plant, it'll be irreversible!

957
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:58,571
Letting Gasback get away
is a bigger problem! Out of the way!

958
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:05,786
I'm...

959
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:12,126
no different...

960
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:14,920
from Gasback, am I?

961
01:10:47,912 --> 01:10:49,663
<i>That idiot...</i>

962
01:11:03,969 --> 01:11:06,305
Mom, what's that?

963
01:11:06,388 --> 01:11:09,099
Hm? It's a precious secret.

964
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:10,809
A precious secret?

965
01:11:10,893 --> 01:11:15,314
I'll tell you some day when you're grown up.

966
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:20,486
I'm sorry, Amelia.

967
01:11:20,569 --> 01:11:27,618
I won't be able to be by
your side as you grow up.

968
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:33,082
The precious secret...
that I promised to tell you...

969
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:35,042
I'll tell you now...

970
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:36,210
Mom!

971
01:11:36,293 --> 01:11:39,088
Mom... Mom!

972
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:45,469
What is it? Mom, what is it?!

973
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:49,765
Mom!

974
01:11:55,187 --> 01:11:56,981
Ma.

975
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:58,315
Ma.

976
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:02,236
We have to report to headquarters
about the end of Vash the Stampede.

977
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:04,029
Let's hurry already!

978
01:12:04,113 --> 01:12:07,032
Ah! Ma'am! Watch out!

979
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:29,555
You were Gasback's bodyguard, right?

980
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:33,517
My term expired.
I'm working as a free agent now.

981
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:39,690
Then... would you like
to be hired by me this time?

982
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:41,525
So you're really gonna do it, huh?

983
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:44,778
Do you have the same principle as Vash's?

984
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:51,618
Give me all the money you
have as an advance payment.

985
01:12:56,290 --> 01:13:00,169
Also... add in breakfast.

986
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:03,380
It's against my principles to skip breakfast.

987
01:13:24,485 --> 01:13:26,236
Boss!

988
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,488
Hm?

989
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,672
The bodyguard guy and that girl again?

990
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:48,467
Those two came by themselves? How amusing.

991
01:14:31,552 --> 01:14:32,803
Dammit!

992
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:52,656
Duck to the left and run towards where I shoot.

993
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:53,824
Got it.

994
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:57,119
One... two... three!

995
01:14:59,913 --> 01:15:02,332
Go!

996
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:03,750
Over there!

997
01:15:06,837 --> 01:15:08,589
Now...

998
01:15:26,857 --> 01:15:27,858
Hm?!

999
01:15:31,153 --> 01:15:34,907
You're missing on purpose, aren't you?

1000
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:37,868
Aren't you after my life?

1001
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:42,664
But... if you keep it up, you're an eyesore!

1002
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:53,550
I'm taking the plant back!

1003
01:15:53,634 --> 01:15:55,093
What?!

1004
01:16:04,645 --> 01:16:06,897
That's as far as you go.

1005
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:29,086
In this world where you
take and have things taken...

1006
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:32,839
you tried to steal from a robber.
You've sure got some guts.

1007
01:16:32,923 --> 01:16:38,720
Then, you won't have
a problem even if I take your life?

1008
01:16:40,138 --> 01:16:43,850
You made a disgrace of my robbery!

1009
01:16:52,276 --> 01:16:55,654
Glad to see you, buddy.

1010
01:16:55,737 --> 01:16:57,781
Don't move!

1011
01:16:57,864 --> 01:17:01,285
Sorry. This is it for you.

1012
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:07,082
I'll take your life, too.

1013
01:17:10,836 --> 01:17:13,297
See ya, buddy.

1014
01:17:38,572 --> 01:17:41,116
Shane! Did you use a toy gun or something?!

1015
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,869
No! This can't be...! I did shoot him!

1016
01:17:46,955 --> 01:17:50,709
Amelia, sweetie! Are you all right?!

1017
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:53,337
Hey you... Aren't you doing a sloppy job?

1018
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,672
What're you gonna do if
my sweet Amelia gets hurt?

1019
01:17:55,756 --> 01:17:58,008
More importantly, you died, didn't you?!

1020
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:02,095
Well, I thought I was a goner,
too, but look at this.

1021
01:18:02,179 --> 01:18:05,515
Hard smoked thomas sure is good
to have while traveling in the desert, huh?

1022
01:18:05,599 --> 01:18:08,977
On top of that, the insurance
girls happened to pass by.

1023
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,566
I almost died.

1024
01:18:14,649 --> 01:18:16,485
You son of a bitch...

1025
01:18:21,448 --> 01:18:24,368
I'll beat you up... later.

1026
01:18:24,451 --> 01:18:26,078
What?! Aren't you happy I'm alive?

1027
01:18:26,161 --> 01:18:27,496
Shall I beat you up right here and now?

1028
01:18:27,579 --> 01:18:29,456
No thank you.

1029
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:32,501
So... how about we end this whole thing now?

1030
01:18:32,584 --> 01:18:34,419
It'll become real tough if we continue.

1031
01:18:34,503 --> 01:18:35,796
Hm?

1032
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:42,511
Vash.

1033
01:18:42,594 --> 01:18:44,221
I wanna settle with you.

1034
01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:45,680
No, why don't we stop...

1035
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:50,894
Shut up! <i>I'll</i> keep on moving...
after I take your life.

1036
01:18:50,977 --> 01:18:54,481
Why don't we find out if that
die you cast was good or bad?

1037
01:19:03,323 --> 01:19:05,158
Wolf wood...

1038
01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:08,745
I don't want you to interfere.

1039
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:11,331
You're always trying to steal the show.

1040
01:19:11,415 --> 01:19:12,958
Amelia...

1041
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:46,783
This isn't a duel or anything,
the signal is when this hits the ground.

1042
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:56,246
You're a lot stronger than him, aren't you?

1043
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:58,331
I now realize well that

1044
01:21:58,415 --> 01:22:02,460
the Humanoid Typhoon legend
isn't based only on devil's luck.

1045
01:22:02,544 --> 01:22:05,088
I'm sorry.

1046
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:08,091
I owe you an apology, don't I?

1047
01:22:08,174 --> 01:22:13,722
Yeah. If you hadn't saved
Gasback twenty years ago,

1048
01:22:13,805 --> 01:22:16,683
my mom might've survived.

1049
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,729
I'm really... sorry.

1050
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:26,526
It's not...

1051
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:29,654
I-It's not over yet.

1052
01:22:29,738 --> 01:22:30,822
Wait.

1053
01:22:32,282 --> 01:22:35,994
I... will...

1054
01:22:38,872 --> 01:22:41,166
take your life!

1055
01:22:51,176 --> 01:22:52,969
What the...

1056
01:23:12,781 --> 01:23:14,949
You...

1057
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:17,827
that glove...

1058
01:23:17,911 --> 01:23:20,955
Where did you get that glove?

1059
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:26,503
That... I made it... and gave it to...

1060
01:23:26,586 --> 01:23:28,713
My mom...

1061
01:23:30,215 --> 01:23:35,428
My mom... left it for me.

1062
01:23:35,512 --> 01:23:38,723
Wh...at?!

1063
01:23:38,807 --> 01:23:43,812
That's right. She's the one whom
you gave this to twenty years ago...

1064
01:23:43,895 --> 01:23:46,314
Then you are...

1065
01:23:46,398 --> 01:23:51,861
After you left, my mom
gave birth to me by herself.

1066
01:23:51,945 --> 01:23:53,697
She went through hardships and worked hard.

1067
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:55,031
Can't be...

1068
01:23:55,115 --> 01:23:57,992
I gave her enough to live
comfortably for the rest of her life.

1069
01:23:58,076 --> 01:24:02,872
Someone just like you took it away!
He took everything away!

1070
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:10,505
No one would help
Gasback's wife and daughter.

1071
01:24:30,608 --> 01:24:32,026
Did she die?

1072
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:35,739
Even the doctor wouldn't see her.

1073
01:24:35,822 --> 01:24:40,076
She gave it to you?

1074
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:45,290
She didn't tell me the reason... and then she...

1075
01:25:20,116 --> 01:25:25,497
<i>That's not it... That's not it, right'?</i>

1076
01:25:27,499 --> 01:25:31,628
<i>That's not what you wanted to say, right, mom'?</i>

1077
01:25:35,715 --> 01:25:39,761
Maybe this means that I cast a die, too.

1078
01:25:39,844 --> 01:25:42,722
Guess I can't make fun of you, huh?

1079
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:53,817
Gasback!

1080
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:57,028
Don't think that you can
just get away like this!

1081
01:25:57,111 --> 01:26:00,532
I can't live as I please unless I kill you!

1082
01:26:00,615 --> 01:26:02,742
Tsk. So he's still alive.

1083
01:26:02,826 --> 01:26:05,870
Yikes. How tiresome. What does he want now?

1084
01:26:05,954 --> 01:26:09,749
Whoa! That design's something else...

1085
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:11,793
Wolf wood, I'll leave the rest to you.

1086
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:14,671
What?! Don't be silly!
Follow through until the end!

1087
01:26:14,754 --> 01:26:16,965
It's my thanks for you giving an inch earlier.

1088
01:26:17,048 --> 01:26:18,508
I don't need to deal with small fry like him!

1089
01:26:18,591 --> 01:26:22,554
I want everyone dead.
The worst will befall everyone but me!

1090
01:26:22,637 --> 01:26:25,598
Hey, Needle-noggin! Hey! Ugh!

1091
01:26:28,268 --> 01:26:30,103
Go home.

1092
01:26:30,186 --> 01:26:31,604
Huh?

1093
01:27:07,223 --> 01:27:09,142
Hey! Are you okay?!

1094
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:12,145
Hey! Here you go!

1095
01:27:25,033 --> 01:27:29,329
At any rate, she didn't have to donate
all the money to the town, you know.

1096
01:27:29,412 --> 01:27:32,582
She could've given me
a bonus or a contingency fee, right?

1097
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:34,876
It's your own fault for not
putting it in the contract, right?

1098
01:27:34,959 --> 01:27:37,754
You too had a right to about
half of the bounty money, right?

1099
01:27:37,837 --> 01:27:38,755
Why'd you turn it down?

1100
01:27:38,838 --> 01:27:41,424
Going to the police will mean trouble, right?

1101
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:43,760
Besides, don't rely on my wallet.

1102
01:27:43,843 --> 01:27:45,595
I still do...

1103
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:48,848
after all, if I'm walking
with a chunk of $$60 billion,

1104
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:52,101
there's more possibility that I may not
have to be an errand boy for a robber.

1105
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:55,229
Give me a break! Don't walk so close!

1106
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:58,316
Geez... How cold you are.

1107
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:00,109
Excuse me, but we're going on ahead.

1108
01:28:00,193 --> 01:28:03,029
We have to return to headquarters ASAP.

1109
01:28:03,112 --> 01:28:06,950
It turns out that we don't have to pay the
insurance money for the bronze statue.

1110
01:28:07,033 --> 01:28:09,160
Oh really? That's good.

1111
01:28:09,243 --> 01:28:11,871
A criminal made the
contract under a false name.

1112
01:28:11,955 --> 01:28:13,748
So it's only natural.

1113
01:28:13,831 --> 01:28:17,335
We can now very proudly
report to headquarters.

1114
01:28:17,418 --> 01:28:19,712
How cheerful they are.

1115
01:28:40,692 --> 01:28:42,318
Come with me.

1116
01:28:42,402 --> 01:28:44,821
That'll protect you.

1117
01:28:44,904 --> 01:28:48,658
Thank you, but I can't go with a robber.

1118
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:50,827
But I'll accept this...

1119
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:55,498
because if I return it,
my connection to you will be cut, right?

1120
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:59,585
And the next time we meet...

1121
01:29:04,966 --> 01:29:07,760
She beat me.

1122
01:29:11,931 --> 01:29:16,769
Say... did you know... that she's 19?

1123
01:29:16,853 --> 01:29:19,939
Well, I thought that she
was around that age at least.

1124
01:29:20,023 --> 01:29:26,946
In other words, if you hadn't saved
Gasback, she wouldn't have been born.

1125
01:29:29,949 --> 01:29:33,036
Well, that's it.

1126
01:29:34,245 --> 01:29:35,413
Yeah.

1127
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:44,380
I guess this means you don't
always get bad rolls of the dice, huh?

1128
01:29:44,464 --> 01:29:45,715
Yep.

1129
01:29:54,974 --> 01:29:59,353
Hey, where're you going?!
The neighboring town is straight that way.

1130
01:29:59,437 --> 01:30:04,025
Hey! Wait a sec! Show me that paper!

1131
01:30:04,108 --> 01:30:06,027
Ah! Hey!

1132
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:11,491
The Dodongo brothers, who were given
a 270-year jail sentence, bust out of jail.

1133
01:30:11,574 --> 01:30:13,242
Hey...

1134
01:30:13,326 --> 01:30:15,161
Don't tell me...

1135
01:30:15,244 --> 01:30:18,748
Did you have something to do...
with troublesome guys like them?

1136
01:30:18,831 --> 01:30:20,124
Did you or not?!

1137
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:23,044
Hey, answer me! Did you or not?!
Did you have something to do with them?!

1138
01:30:23,127 --> 01:30:25,546
Didn't you? Hey, wait!
