1
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:24,420


2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


3
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,990
Frankly speaking,

4
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,970
this is impossible for Yukina with her current grades.

5
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,840
You know, "impossible" is a word you can only use <i>after</i> you've explored all possibilities.

6
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,560
And... have you?

7
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,060
She'll have to raise

8
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,570
her standardized score by at least thirty points.

9
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,240
Roughly put,

10
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,750
that means passing 500,000 people in the next 18 months.

11
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,550
Do you really think that's possible?

12
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,660
The young lady says she wants to go.

13
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,190
Are you trying to nip her ambitions in the bud?

14
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,610
It's not even a bud at this stage.

15
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,080
Just a pipe dream buried far underground.

16
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,460
Aren't teachers supposed to encourage their students to chase their dreams?

17
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,250
No. We make our pupils face reality and guide them to goals within their reach.

18
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,880
That's our job as educators.

19
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,200
Facing up to adversity is what makes kids grow stronger!

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,120
Sure, but I wouldn't call this adversity.

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,310
Stupidity is more fitting.

22
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,270
Her current grades reflect her lack of ability <i>and</i> effort.

23
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,840
Please don't project yourself upon your daughter, Mrs. Shirahane.

24
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,520
No two people are the same.

25
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,430
I guess I'll leave you to do your damn job, then.

26
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,120
Mom!

27
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,160
Sorry about that, sir.

28
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,610
Shirahane...

29
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,180
"Mars" is not a career, you know.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,430
Right.

31
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,460
It's more of a destination, isn't it?

32
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,460
That's not the point.

33
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,940
Besides, at this stage, the Mars emigration project is highly unlikely to come to fruition.

34
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,850
Is that yours?

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,710
Yoohoo!

36
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,730
Did you see where my mom went, Mika?

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,150
Upstairs?

38
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,200
What's up?

39
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,540
She left her phone behind.

40
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,590
Whoa, a UN phone? Super cool.

41
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,450
Mom, you forgot this!

42
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,750
Mom!

43
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,470
Yukina... Martians don't actually exist, okay?

44
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,060
Jeez...

45
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,520
Talk about awesome.

46
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,130
Your mom's super cool, Yukina.

47
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,530
She's the exact opposite of what you'd want from a mom.

48
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,080
Hey, mine's just a regular old lady.

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,360
But yours is the chief of a UN research facility.

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,300
So, how'd career counseling go?

51
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,370
What'd you put down?

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,290
Mars.

53
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,260
What?

54
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,370
That hotter?

55
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,010
Nah, colder.

56
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,800
But get a load of this.

57
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,800
My mom wasn't against it.

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,050
Take your life more seriously, girl.

59
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,040
Why Mars, anyway?

60
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,490
I wanted to go see the Martian canals.

61
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,050
Wait, those really exist?

62
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,310
They don't?

63
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,250
I think scientists proved that they don't.

64
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,810
I refuse to believe their lies.

65
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,810
I bet they're just hiding them from us.

66
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,110
You sure do love your conspiracy theories.

67
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,420
It'd be nice to see the river terraces on Mars, too.

68
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,510
What are you even talking about?

69
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,470
And isn't that your mom's phone?

70
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,870
Shoot, I forgot.

71
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,470
I can't believe she left something so valuable behind.

72
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,420
Like daughter, like mother, I guess.

73
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,410
But now that she has, you gotta take it to her, right?

74
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,840
No way! I don't wanna go!

75
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,510
Quit your whining and follow me!

76
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,160
Let's go!

77
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,520
Step on it!

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,750
Yoohoo, Sophie!

79
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,770
Were you here for career counseling too?

80
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,640
Greetings.

81
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,610
And no, I have no need for counseling.

82
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,550
Ah, right. You're too young for that.

83
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,680
No, it's because my mind's already made up.

84
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,290
I'm going to devote my life to what I'm already doing.

85
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,450
How about you, Yukina?

86
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,660
I, uh...

87
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,080
Said she put down "Mars."

88
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,140
Mars as in the planet Mars?

89
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,580
Yeah. Where the Martians live.

90
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,290
I suggest you keep your silliness to a minimum.

91
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,890
Sorry I'm stupid...

92
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,710
Headed to work, Sophie?

93
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,360
Yes.

94
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,980
On that note, I bid you farewell.

95
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,970
Toodles!

96
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,070
That girl sure is something.

97
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,600
Skipping grades and all.

98
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,150
<i>And</i> she works at a UN facility?

99
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,030
She's in a whole different league than us.

100
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,590
Oh, right. I can just get her to take this to my mom.

101
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,590
Take this with you, Sophie!

102
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,410
Milady.

103
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,110
Your friend seems to be chasing after us.

104
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,840
Pay her no heed. Keep going.

105
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,420
As you wish.

106
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,430
Wait, we're getting on!

107
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,870
The rise in water level has changed the river's course!

108
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,820
You're always looking at that. Don't you ever get bored of it?

109
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,530
Not really, no.

110
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,860
Good for you.

111
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,130
Hey, wait up!

112
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,780
The dam!

113
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,650
It always looks so amazing!

114
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,850
Control yourself.

115
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,530
You can stare at it all you want on the way back.

116
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,350
Whoa! Talk about huge!

117
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,270
Your mom developed those, right?

118
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,630
Apparently.

119
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,710
Why didn't you wanna come here?

120
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,460
I don't like the place...

121
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,610
Or that stuff.

122
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,570
Oh, you get treated like royalty 'cause of your mom.

123
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,530
The way the people here look at me really puts me on edge.

124
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,950
Say, what'd you put down for your career plans?

125
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,870
Finding work or something.

126
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,280
Where?

127
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,620
Beats me.

128
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,320
Any place willing to hire a moron with no talents, guts, or brains is fine by me.

129
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,250
It'll be hard with your current grades, won't it?

130
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,680
All my relatives say I must be a late bloomer,

131
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,180
so whoever gives me a chance is bound to hit the jackpot.

132
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,230
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,500
Looking at you always makes me want to work harder.

134
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,600
Why do I get the feeling you're making fun of me?

135
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,710
Just your imagination.

136
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,370
Anyway, I'm gonna go give my old man a surprise.

137
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,710
He works at the mess, right?

138
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,170
Yeah. He's a cook.

139
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,120
And he's probably free around now.

140
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,200
Meet up at four?

141
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,580
Sure thing. See you later.

142
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,790
Toodles!

143
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,000
Sheesh.

144
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,460
Why didn't you just give it back to me at school?

145
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,830
You're always like this.

146
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,500
Never listen to a word others say.

147
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,810
Here.

148
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,520
Thanks.

149
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,350
Anyway, you'd better put in the effort if you want to go to Mars.

150
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,080
I'm not so sure it's a dream that can be fulfilled with effort alone.

151
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,930
Don't worry, nothing is impossible for you. You're my daughter.

152
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,240
Cut it out.

153
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,100
Oh, right.

154
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,870
If you're going to go, do it after Koharu grows up.

155
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,720
How about you spend some time raising your own child?

156
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,250
Hey, I raised you just fine.

157
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,040
No, you didn't. Uncle did.

158
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,000
Ah, teenagers. Always blind to their parents' love.

159
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,490
Well, do your best and show your teacher who's boss.

160
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,590
Look at her, acting like a parent when she feels like it.

161
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,650
How am I supposed to kill time until four?

162
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,150
It's not an ICBM, is it?

163
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,280
Different size.

164
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,890
Possibly a meteorite.

165
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,550
Orbital inclination is at 98 degrees.

166
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,570
Airspeed at two kilometers per second.

167
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,720
Just two?

168
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,460
That's pretty slow for a meteorite.

169
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,340
Object 1 making entry.

170
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,670
Here's the estimated point of impact.

171
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,470
Object 1 dropping multiple fragments!

172
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,530
Did it break apart?

173
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,660
We're unable to confirm.

174
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,480
Object 1 decelerating!

175
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,470
Say what?!

176
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,810
The evil demons shall return.

177
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,320
Return?

178
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,030
Yes, they will return from a faraway world

179
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,250
to devour humans once more.

180
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,880
Oh, no! I'll get eaten!

181
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,850
Crap!

182
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,260
Oh, I still have time.

183
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,270
Mr. Aramata!

184
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,590
Oh, hey, Yuki.

185
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,630
Hello.

186
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,750
Here to see Hiromi?

187
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,560
I guess.

188
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,840
I keep telling her to go home every now and then, but she never listens.

189
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,850
{\an8}Is Koharu watching period dramas like always?

190
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,690
{\an8}All the time.

191
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,410
{\an8}Some taste that girl has.

192
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,010
Who's that?

193
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,420
Yukina, Hiromi's daughter.

194
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,410
Her? Really?

195
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,860
Is that...

196
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,620
I think I've seen it somewhere before.

197
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,630
It's "The Cube."

198
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,840
Oh, I've heard of it.

199
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,930
It was found in a fracture zone during tunnel construction work 60 years ago, right?

200
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,150
Aren't you well-informed.

201
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,930
Is it okay for an outsider like me to see it?

202
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,300
No problem.

203
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,350
This artifact's existence was made public.

204
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,020
Not like we know anything about it.

205
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,910
The giant downstairs is much better than this piece of junk.

206
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,940
Giant?

207
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,560
Another artifact, but not much information has been released about that one.

208
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,600
It's also the reason this research facility was built here.

209
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,910
The reason? Why?

210
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,970
We can't move it.

211
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,370
It's more like a demon than a giant, really.

212
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,330
Demon?

213
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,770
Professor Takehito Shirahane...

214
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,020
Your father was researching local folklore, wasn't he?

215
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,340
That's right.

216
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,600
Did he say anything about a demon?

217
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
I haven't seen him since he disappeared eight years ago.

218
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,350
Oh, is that so?

219
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,380
Dumbass.

220
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,780
What's going on?

221
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,820
Is that...

222
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,750
Get back!

223
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,010
What just happened?

224
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,320
Impact confirmed!

225
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,220
Landing point was three kilometers out at sea!

226
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,690
MSDF submarine Michishio, which was conducting an exercise in the area,

227
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,030
is now heading there to investigate.

228
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,900
What about the fragments?

229
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,370
They seem to have landed between Nagano and Toyama.

230
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,830
One has landed near the UN facility!

231
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,770
Are you okay, Mr. Aramata?

232
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,530
Well, I'll be damned!

233
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,430
Glasses... Glasses...

234
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,430
A meteorite?

235
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,390
A meteorite? For real?

236
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,320
Sortie! On the double!

237
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,960
This is a United Nations research facility!

238
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,010
Trespassers will be met with deadly force!

239
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,680
Turn back at once!

240
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,260
What the hell are those things?

241
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,480
It's dangerous outside!

242
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,940
Go hide underground!

243
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,160
What about you?

244
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,170
I need to meet up with Hiromi!

245
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,270
I'm returning to the lab.

246
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,460
You guys hurry up and take shelter underground!

247
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,870
Extinguish the fires pronto!

248
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,320
Don't let them inside, no matter what!

249
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Ignore the big one.

250
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,120
I'm taking over command now.

251
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,280
I trust you have no objections?

252
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,550
Of course not, Major Graham.

253
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,570
You have free reign.{oniisama}

254
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,330
This research facility is hereby 
placed under emergency alert.

255
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,370
All orders will be issued from Security HQ.

256
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,380
Squad Alpha, head to the west gate and halt the enemy's advance.

257
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,440
Standby.

258
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,230
Squad Bravo...

259
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,500
I don't want to admit it, but does this mean he was right on the money?

260
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,920
Looks like it.

261
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,320
I just wish this had happened after I retired.

262
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,850
Major, message from Captain Bowden in GAUS1.

263
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,120
Hey, Major!

264
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,800
What do you think these things are? Mountains of shit?

265
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,230
Keeping them safe is only gonna make it stink in here!

266
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,120
Can they be mobilized?

267
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,150
They're not in an ideal state as of yet, but I guarantee they're mobile.

268
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,180
Currently, they have an estimated 
operation time of one hour.

269
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,160
But I can't say how quickly they'll burn through energy in actual combat.

270
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,580
You have completed the mass driver tests, yes?

271
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,160
Yes, but only in simulation.

272
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,680
Will you still use it?

273
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,740
I'd rather that than open the gate.

274
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,900
GAUS1, GAUS2, prepare to sortie.

275
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,090
Launch using the mass drivers at minimum output.

276
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,920
Hurry up, you slowpokes!

277
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,690
Send us out already!

278
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,200
The battle's gonna end before we even get out there!

279
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,840
Gravity stabilizers at max output.

280
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,780
Inertia canceler calibrated.

281
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,600
Graviton generation all clear.

282
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,180
The mountains of shit are finally getting ready to rumble!

283
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,140
Where am I?

284
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,710
It hasn't been destroyed?

285
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,610
Princess!

286
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,640
You are all right?

287
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,580
Excuse me?

288
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,840
I'm glad I was simply mistaken.

289
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,280
Wh-Who the hell are you?

290
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,960
I am Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma!

291
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,040
Could you be the demons' minions?!

292
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,260
Once I'm done playing with you, you won't be able to laugh or cry anymore!

293
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,540
Your ass is as loose as a whore's!

294
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,290
And did you lose your head giving too much head?

295
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,540
You trying to kill us, you little bitch?!

296
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,950
Pardon me.

297
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,830
Screw you.

298
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,540
I'm gonna split your coconut and pour the drizzling shits down it.

299
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,080
Nice shot.

300
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,900
A 120mm to the ass was enough to take it out?!

301
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,560
Princess...

302
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,310
Are you all right?

303
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,090
H-He's over there!

304
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,640
You confounded lapdogs!

305
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,310
Wh-What are you trying to do to Yukina?

306
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,730
"Yukina"?

307
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,950
Who the hell is this dude?

308
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,910
I don't know...

309
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:37,150
Apparently GAUS is short for "Gravity Attenuated Upright Shell."

310
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,980
It was developed at the Kurobe research facility!

311
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,580
Immorality creaks in the dark

312
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,100
Blurring the advantages of evolution

313
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,630
Sorrow remains silent

314
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,390
Simply praying for the safety of the soul

315
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,440
I'm always just barely behind the times

316
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,890
Surrounded by thick gray clouds

317
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,370
Acid rain pours down on me

318
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,660
Melting away my morals tonight

319
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,110
Everyone's assigned an alphabet

320
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,750
Everyone's called by their code

321
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,160
Acting with no sense of reason

322
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,540
For whom are these battles fought

323
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:12,010
The scar that remains in the corner of my memories shed light to the end

324
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:16,470
A voice in the distance whispered gently

325
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,850
A new age is coming

326
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,320
Love transcends time

327
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,760
Dreams go the distance

328
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,700
Voices will reach to the ends of the earth

329
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,190
No matter how weak the light

330
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,910
I have the ultimate strength to believe

331
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,450
This is the strength of our bond

332
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:47,190
Love will transcend time

333

Career Plans Questionnaire - Yukina Shirahane
