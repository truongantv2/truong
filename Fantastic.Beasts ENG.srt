1
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:17,013
Dougal, settle down now, please.

2
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:19,724
It won't be long.

3
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:39,077
<i>Next.</i>

4
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,961
- British, huh?
- Yes.

5
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:50,213
- First trip to New York?
- Yes.

6
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,549
Anything edible in there?

7
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:54,092
No.

8
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:56,928
Livestock?

9
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,936
Must get that fixed.
Um... No.

10
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,355
Let me take a look.

11
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,297
<i>Welcome to New York.</i>

12
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:33,506
Thank you.

13
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,883
Next.

14
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,972
<i>And it was like a... Like a wind.</i>

15
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,808
<i>Or like a... Like a ghost.</i>

16
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,018
<i>But dark.</i>

17
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,062
And I saw its eyes.

18
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,190
Shining white eyes.

19
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,155
A dark wind, with eyes?

20
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:58,990
It's like a dark mass.

21
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,494
And it dove down there.
Down underground.

22
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,331
<i>Someone ought to do something about it.</i>

23
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:09,792
<i>It's everywhere, this thing.
It's out of control.</i>

24
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,838
Hey, you get anything?

25
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:16,507
<i>Dark wind. Blah, blah.</i>

26
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,344
<i>Some sorta
atmospheric hooey. Or electrical.</i>

27
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,221
<i>Hey, you thirsty?</i>

28
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:26,142
No. I'm on the wagon.
Promised Martha I'd lay off.

29
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,522
<i>It's atmospheric.</i>

30
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:10,478
Out of the way, folks. Coming through!

31
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:15,400
<i>This great city sparkles
with the jewels of man's inventions.</i>

32
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,902
Movie theaters, automobiles,

33
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,655
the wireless, electric lights,

34
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,741
<i>- all dazzle and bewitch us.</i>
- I'm so sorry.

35
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:27,578
But where there is light,
there is shadow, friend.

36
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,498
<i>Something is stalking our city,</i>

37
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,210
wreaking destruction, and then
disappearing without a trace!

38
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,160
<i>Listen to me!</i>

39
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,089
<i>We have to fight.</i>

40
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:42,510
Join us, the Second Salemers,
in our fight.

41
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:45,513
Excuse me, doll.
Just trying to get to the bank.

42
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,824
We have to fight together

43
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,117
- for the sake of our...
- Excuse me...

44
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:49,267
<i>Hey! Watch it!</i>

45
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,436
So sorry. My case.

46
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,022
No harm done.

47
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,149
Excuse me.

48
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,525
You!

49
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,068
Friend.

50
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:04,407
What drew you to our meeting today?

51
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,868
Oh, I was just passing.

52
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,369
<i>Are you a seeker?</i>

53
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:10,621
A seeker after truth?

54
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,417
<i>I'm more of a chaser, really.</i>

55
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,004
Hear my words.

56
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:19,589
And heed my warning.

57
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,426
<i>And laugh if you dare.</i>

58
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:27,847
Witches live among us.

59
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:31,476
We have to fight together
for the sake of our children.

60
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,436
For the sake of tomorrow.

61
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,008
<i>What do you say to that, friend?</i>

62
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:47,158
Excuse me.

63
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,305
Can I help you, sir?

64
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,185
No, I was just...
I was just waiting.

65
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:25,947
Hi.

66
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:29,367
What brings you here?

67
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,536
Same as you.

68
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:34,629
You're here to get a loan
to open up a bakery?

69
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:35,873
Yes.

70
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,835
What are the odds of that?

71
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,549
- Well, may the best man win, I guess.
- Excuse me.

72
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,553
Hey! Hey, mister!

73
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,096
Hey, mister.

74
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,640
Hey, fella.

75
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,560
Mr. Kowalski,
Mr. Bingley will see you now.

76
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,062
Okay.

77
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,731
Okay.

78
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,152
<i>You're currently working</i>

79
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:29,677
in a canning factory.

80
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:33,431
That's the best I can do.
I only got back in, uh, '24.

81
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,809
- Got back?
- From Europe, sir.

82
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:40,021
Yeah. I was part
of the expeditionary forces there.

83
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:13,983
- All right.
- <i>Mr. Kowalski...</i>

84
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,099
You gotta try the paczkis, okay?

85
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,728
It's my grandmother's recipe.
The orange zest just...

86
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,695
<i>Mr. Kowalski.</i>

87
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:26,484
What do you propose
to offer the bank as collateral?

88
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:28,444
Collateral?

89
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:30,112
Collateral.

90
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,449
<i>There are machines now</i>

91
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:37,286
that can produce hundreds
of donuts an hour.

92
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,806
I know. I know. But they're nothing
like what I can do. You...

93
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,166
<i>The bank must be protected,
Mr. Kowalski.</i>

94
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:44,835
Good day to you.

95
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:08,025
Hey! Mr. English Guy!

96
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,819
I think your egg is hatching.

97
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,667
What just happened?

98
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,725
But, excuse me?

99
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,899
I was over there. Came over...

100
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,693
I was over there.

101
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,240
- In you hop.
- <i>Hello?</i>

102
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:57,843
No.

103
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,118
<i>Everyone settle down.</i>

104
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,216
<i>Stay. Dougal, don't make me come in there.</i>

105
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:05,374
Don't make me come down there.

106
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,212
Absolutely not.

107
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,298
<i>Alohomora.</i>

108
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:18,054
Oh, so you're gonna steal the money, huh?

109
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,033
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

110
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:24,935
Mr. Bingley!

111
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,398
Kowalski.

112
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:35,613
<i>Really?</i>

113
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,338
<i>No. Don't play that.</i>

114
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,757
Look.

115
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:00,596
Oh, no.

116
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,140
No, no, no. Don't... Don't shoot.

117
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:04,975
Don't shoot!

118
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,603
Right. For the last time,
you pilfering pest,

119
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,648
paws off what doesn't belong to you.

120
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:12,095
<i>Someone's robbing the bank!</i>

121
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,818
Awfully sorry about that.

122
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,154
What the hell was that?

123
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,178
<i>Nothing that need concern you.</i>

124
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,910
Now, unfortunately,
you have seen far too much.

125
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,877
If you wouldn't mind,
if you just stand there,

126
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:26,497
this'll be over in a jiffy.

127
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:27,748
Mmm-hmm. Sure. Yeah.

128
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:31,919
Sorry.

129
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,007
Bugger.

130
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,151
Who are you?

131
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:57,987
- I'm sorry.
- Who are you?

132
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:01,365
- Newt Scamander. And you are?
- What's that thing in your case?

133
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:03,534
That's my Niffler.

134
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,370
Say, you've got something on your...

135
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,347
Why in the name of Deliverance Dane
did you let that thing loose?

136
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,101
I didn't mean to.
He's incorrigible, you see.

137
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,325
- Anything shiny, he's all over...
- You didn't mean to?

138
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:14,688
- No.
- You could not have chosen

139
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,173
a worse time to let that creature loose.

140
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,341
We're in the middle of a situation here.

141
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:22,678
I'm taking you in.

142
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,388
Taking me in where?

143
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,351
MAGICAL CONGGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

144
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,229
So you work for MACUSA?

145
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,289
What are you, some kind of investigator?

146
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,787
At least tell me
you took care of the No-Maj.

147
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:42,156
- The what?
- The No-Maj.

148
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,784
No-Magic.
The non-wizard!

149
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,263
Oh. Sorry, we call them Muggles.

150
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,830
You wiped his memory, right?

151
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:51,999
The No-Maj with the case?

152
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,211
- Um...
- Oh...

153
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,464
That's a Section 3-A, Mr. Scamander.

154
00:13:58,756 --> 00:13:59,840
I'm taking you in.

155
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:09,767
<i>Come on.</i>

156
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:14,355
Sorry, but I do have
things to do, actually.

157
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:17,316
Well...
You'll have to rearrange them.

158
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,152
What are you doin' in New York anyway?

159
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,737
I came to buy a birthday present.

160
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,091
Couldn't you have done that in London?

161
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,052
<i>No, there's only one breeder
of Appaloosa Puffskeins in the world,</i>

162
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:29,203
and he lives in New York. So, no.

163
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:32,122
I got a Section 3-A.

164
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,209
Hey.

165
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:39,088
By the way, we don't allow the breeding
of magical creatures in New York.

166
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:41,590
<i>We closed that guy down a year ago.</i>

167
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:31,807
Hey, Goldstein.

168
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:33,684
Hey, Red.

169
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:38,897
Major Investigation Department.

170
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,264
- I thought you was...
- Major Investigation Department.

171
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:42,735
I got a Section 3-A.

172
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,704
The International Confederation
is threatening to send a delegation.

173
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,583
They think this is related to
Grindelwald's attacks in Europe.

174
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,460
I was there.

175
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,879
This is a beast.

176
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:06,342
No human could do what this thing
is capable of, Madam President.

177
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,054
Whatever it is, one thing is clear.
It must be stopped.

178
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,722
<i>It's terrorizing No-Majs.</i>

179
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,850
And when No-Majs are afraid, they attack.

180
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,186
This could mean exposure.

181
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:18,479
It could mean war.

182
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,365
I made your position here
quite clear, Ms. Goldstein.

183
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,701
- Yes, Madam President. But I...
- You're no longer an Auror.

184
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,582
No, Madam President, but...

185
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:39,875
<i>Goldstein.</i>

186
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,126
There's been a minor...

187
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:45,631
This office is currently concerned
with very major incidents. Get out.

188
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:46,840
Yes, ma'am.

189
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,827
So you got your wand permit?

190
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,121
<i>All foreigners have to
have them in New York.</i>

191
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,957
I made a postal application weeks ago.

192
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,921
<i>Scamander...</i>

193
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,549
And you were just in Equatorial Guinea?

194
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,527
And I've just completed
a year in the fields.

195
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,636
I'm writing a book
about magical creatures.

196
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,763
Like an extermination guide?

197
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,224
No, a guide to help people understand

198
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,744
why we should be protecting
these creatures instead of killing them.

199
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,894
<i>Goldstein?</i>

200
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:42,479
<i>Where is she?</i>

201
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,023
Where is she? Goldstein?

202
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:47,443
<i>Goldstein?</i>

203
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,697
Did you just butt in
on the investigative team again?

204
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:57,828
Where have you been?

205
00:17:58,162 --> 00:17:59,204
What?

206
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,623
Where'd she pick you up?

207
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,834
Me?

208
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,671
Have you been tracking
them Second Salemers again?

209
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,423
Of course not, sir.

210
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:14,052
Afternoon, Mr. Graves, sir.

211
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,138
Afternoon, Abernathy.

212
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,183
Mr. Graves, sir, this is Mr. Scamander.

213
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,934
He has a crazy creature in that case,

214
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,645
and it got out
and caused mayhem in a bank.

215
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,523
Let's see the little guy.

216
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,552
Tina.

217
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,866
I'm sorry, Grandma.

218
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,569
What the...

219
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:08,542
<i>My momma, your momma
Gonna catch a witch</i>

220
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:12,629
<i>My momma, your momma
Flying on a switch</i>

221
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:17,467
<i>My momma, your momma
Witches never cry</i>

222
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:21,471
<i>My momma, your momma
Witches gonna die</i>

223
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:25,601
<i>Witch number one,
drown in the river</i>

224
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,354
<i>Witch number two,
got a noose to give her</i>

225
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:48,290
<i>Witch number three,</i>
<i>gonna watch her burn</i>

226
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:52,502
<i>Witch number four,
flogging take a turn</i>

227
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:01,011
Collect your leaflets
before you get food, children.

228
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,820
Is it a witch's mark, ma'am?

229
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,368
No.

230
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:26,495
He's okay.

231
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,384
I can't believe
you didn't Obliviate that man.

232
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,345
If there's an inquiry, I'm finished.

233
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:45,031
Why would you be finished?
I'm the one that's...

234
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,474
I'm not supposed
to go near the Second Salemers.

235
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,357
What was that?

236
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,944
Uh, moth, I think. Big moth.

237
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,551
<i>Hey! Quiet down!
I'm trying to get a statement.</i>

238
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,828
<i>I'm telling you,
it's a gas explosion again.</i>

239
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,414
I ain't taking
the kids back up there until it's safe.

240
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,420
Hey, sorry, ma'am.
There ain't no smell of gas.

241
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,251
It weren't gas, officer. I seen it.

242
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:17,462
It was a gigantic, huge hippopoto...

243
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,256
Gas.

244
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,717
Gas. It was gas!

245
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,411
<i>Mr. Scamander!</i>

246
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,434
It was open?

247
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,686
Just a smidge.

248
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,653
That crazy Niffler thing's
on the loose again?

249
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,755
Uh... Might be.

250
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,318
Then look for it.

251
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,236
Look! Oh...

252
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,988
His neck's bleeding.

253
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,531
He's hurt.

254
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,242
Oh... Wake up! Mr. No-Maj.

255
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,580
<i>Mercy Lewis, what is that?</i>

256
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,191
It's nothing to worry about.

257
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,336
That is a Murtlap.

258
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,451
What else have you got in there?

259
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,551
- You?
- Hello.

260
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,553
Easy, Mr...

261
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,180
Kowalski. Jacob.

262
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,349
You can't Obliviate him.

263
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:53,517
We need him as a witness.

264
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,745
I'm sorry. You've just yelled at me
the length of New York

265
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,038
for not doing it in the first place.

266
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,022
- He's hurt! He looks ill.
- He'll be fine.

267
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,149
Murtlap bites aren't serious.

268
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,824
Yeah, I admit that is a slightly more
severe reaction than I've seen.

269
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,046
But if it was really serious, he'd have...

270
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,371
What?

271
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,683
Well, the first symptom
would be flames out of his anus.

272
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,143
- He doesn't seem to...
- This is balled up!

273
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,447
It'll last 48 hours at the most.

274
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,034
- I can keep him, if you want me to.
- Keep him?

275
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,464
We don't keep them.

276
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:29,302
Mr. Scamander, do you know anything
about the wizarding community in America?

277
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,030
I do know a few things, actually.

278
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:34,516
I know that you have rather backwards laws
about relations with Non-Magic people.

279
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,953
That you're not meant to befriend them.

280
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:38,788
That you can't marry them,
which seems mildly absurd to me.

281
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,230
Who's gonna marry him?

282
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,607
You're both coming with me.

283
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,401
I don't see why I need to come with you.

284
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,361
- Help me.
- I'm dreaming, right?

285
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,571
- Yeah.
- Please.

286
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,115
I'm tired.
I never went to the bank.

287
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,201
This is all just
some big nightmare, right?

288
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,120
For the both of us, Mr. Kowalski.

289
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,444
<i>Hey, you all right there?</i>

290
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,430
And so this is the newsroom.

291
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:56,681
Let's go.

292
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:58,975
<i>Hey, how are you?</i>

293
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,811
<i>Make way for the Barebones.</i>

294
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,649
Now, they're just
putting the papers to bed,

295
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,359
as they say.

296
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:14,241
Mr. Shaw. Sir. He's with the Senator.

297
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,826
Never mind that, Barker.
I wanna see my father.

298
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,379
I'm so sorry, Mr. Shaw,
but your son insisted.

299
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,019
Father, you're gonna wanna hear this.

300
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,505
I've got something huge.

301
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:30,957
<i>Your brother and I
are busy here, Langdon.</i>

302
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:32,369
<i>Working on his election campaign.</i>

303
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:34,094
<i>We don't have time for this.</i>

304
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:38,098
<i>This is Mary Lou Barebone
from the New Salem Preservation Society.</i>

305
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,016
And she's got a big story for you.

306
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,019
Oh, she has, has she?

307
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:45,689
<i>There's strange things
going on all over the city.</i>

308
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,483
<i>The people behind this,
they are not like you and me.</i>

309
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,610
<i>This is witchcraft. Don't you see?</i>

310
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,857
- Langdon.
- She doesn't want any money.

311
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,700
Then either her story is worthless,
or she's lying about the cost.

312
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,986
Nobody gives away anything
valuable for free, Langdon.

313
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,439
<i>You're right, Mr. Shaw.</i>

314
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,832
What we desire is infinitely
more valuable than money.

315
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,542
It's your influence.

316
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,295
<i>Millions of people read your newspapers,</i>

317
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,463
and they need to be made aware
about this danger.

318
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,383
The crazy disturbances in the subway.

319
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,051
<i>Just look at the pictures.</i>

320
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,258
<i>I'd like
you and your friends to leave.</i>

321
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:20,406
No. Look, you're missing a trick here.
Just look at the evidence!

322
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:21,725
<i>Really?</i>

323
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:24,227
<i>Langdon.
Listen to Father and just go.</i>

324
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:25,979
And...

325
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:28,606
Take the freaks with you.

326
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,567
<i>This is Father's office,
not yours.</i>

327
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,086
<i>And I'm sick of this.
Every time I walk in here...</i>

328
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,320
<i>Okay. That's it!</i>

329
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:35,822
Thank you.

330
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,244
We hope you'll reconsider, Mr. Shaw.

331
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,539
<i>We're not difficult to find.</i>

332
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,125
Until then,

333
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:48,918
we thank you for your time.

334
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,015
Hey, boy!

335
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,435
You dropped something.

336
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,024
Here you go, freak.

337
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,777
Why don't you put that in the trash
where you all belong?

338
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:25,288
Take a right here.

339
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,216
Okay.

340
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,550
Before we go in...

341
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:40,011
I'm not supposed to have men
on the premises.

342
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:42,907
In that case, Mr. Kowalski and I
can easily seek other accommodations.

343
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,211
No, you don't.

344
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,184
Watch your step.

345
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,942
<i>That you, Tina?</i>

346
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,110
Shh.

347
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,695
Yes, Mrs. Esposito.

348
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,022
<i>Are you alone?</i>

349
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,950
I'm always alone, Mrs. Esposito.

350
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,288
Oh...

351
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,550
<i>Teenie,</i> you brought men home.

352
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,929
Gentlemen, this is my sister.

353
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,183
Wanna put something on, Queenie?

354
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:28,852
Oh, sure.

355
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,370
So, who are they?

356
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:48,746
That's Mr. Scamander.

357
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:52,250
He's committed a serious infraction
of the National Statute of Secrecy.

358
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,627
- He's a criminal?
- Uh-huh.

359
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,713
And that's Mr. Kowalski. He's a No-Maj.

360
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:58,715
<i>A No-Maj?</i>

361
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,050
Teen, what are you up to?

362
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:03,595
He's sick. It's a long story.

363
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:08,391
Mr. Scamander has lost something
I'm going to help him find.

364
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:09,684
Oh...

365
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:11,102
<i>You need to sit down, honey.</i>

366
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:13,146
He hasn't eaten anything all day.

367
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:14,397
And...

368
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,149
Oh, that's rough.

369
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,820
He didn't get the money
he wanted for his bakery.

370
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,069
You bake, honey?

371
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:21,905
Uh...

372
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,740
I love to cook.

373
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,627
- You're a Legilimens?
- <i>Mmm. Yeah.</i>

374
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,620
But I always have trouble
with your kind. Brits.

375
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,330
<i>It's the accent.</i>

376
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:32,999
You know how to read minds?

377
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,918
Oh, don't worry, honey.

378
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:38,087
Most guys think what you was thinking
first time they see me.

379
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:42,926
Now, you need food.

380
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:58,525
<i>Hot dog? Again?</i>
- <i>Don't read my mind.</i>

381
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,131
<i>Not a very wholesome lunch.</i>

382
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,541
Hey, Mr. Scamander.

383
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,713
You prefer pie or strudel?

384
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,802
I really don't have
a preference.

385
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,600
You prefer strudel,
huh, honey?

386
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,229
Strudel it is.

387
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,709
Well, sit down, Mr. Scamander.

388
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,672
We're not gonna poison you.

389
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:39,917
You're upset.

390
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:43,046
It's your mother again.

391
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,715
Somebody said something.

392
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,717
What did they say? Tell me.

393
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:49,594
Do you think I'm a freak?

394
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,722
No. I think you're
a very special young man,

395
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:56,017
or I wouldn't have
asked you to help me, now would I?

396
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:01,981
Have you any news?

397
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:04,442
I'm still looking.

398
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:05,610
Mmm.

399
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,948
Mr. Graves, if I knew
whether it was a girl or a boy...

400
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:14,494
My vision showed
only the child's immense power.

401
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,497
He or she is no older than 10.

402
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,709
I saw this child
in close proximity to your mother.

403
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:24,212
She I saw so plainly.

404
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,277
That could be any one of hundreds...

405
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:29,092
There's something else.
Something I haven't told you.

406
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,594
I saw you beside me in New York.

407
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:36,140
You're the one who gains
this child's trust.

408
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:39,102
You are the key.
I saw this.

409
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:42,271
You want to join the wizarding world.

410
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,191
I want those things too, Credence.

411
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:46,776
I want them for you.

412
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:49,904
So find the child.

413
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:52,782
Find the child and we'll all be free.

414
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,036
<i>The job ain't that glamorous.</i>

415
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,288
I mean, I spend most days making coffee.

416
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:00,998
Unjinxing the john.

417
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,750
Tina's the career girl.

418
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,629
<i>Nah, we're orphans.</i>

419
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:10,133
Ma and Pa died of Dragon Pox
when we were kids.

420
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:12,760
Oh.

421
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:14,137
You're sweet.

422
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,556
But we got each other.

423
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,977
Could you stop
reading my mind for a second?

424
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,228
Oh...

425
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,981
Don't get me wrong, I love it.

426
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,277
This meal, it's insanely good.

427
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:31,362
<i>And this is what I do, I'm a cook.</i>

428
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:35,658
<i>And this is like the greatest meal
I have ever had in my life.</i>

429
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,872
Oh! You slay me.

430
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,000
I ain't never
really talked to a No-Maj before.

431
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,501
Huh.

432
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:46,961
Really?

433
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,511
I am not flirting.

434
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,310
I'm just saying,
don't go getting attached.

435
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,395
He's gonna have to be Obliviated.

436
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,064
It's nothing personal.

437
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:09,776
Oh, hey, you okay, honey?

438
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:13,571
So, Ms. Goldstein, I think Mr. Kowalski
could do with an early night.

439
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:14,882
Besides, you and I will need to be

440
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:17,283
up early tomorrow morning
to find my Niffler, so...

441
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:19,869
What's a Niffler?

442
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,413
Don't ask.

443
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:25,041
Hey, you guys can bunk in here.

444
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:44,060
Uh, I thought you might like a hot drink.

445
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:55,404
<i>Wow!</i>

446
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,243
Psst! Hey. Mr. Scamander, look, cocoa.

447
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:04,247
Toilet's down the hall to the right.

448
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,415
Thanks.

449
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:11,379
Very much.

450
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,070
Come on.

451
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,379
For the love...

452
00:37:08,144 --> 00:37:09,228
Will you sit down?

453
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,356
Good idea.

454
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,279
That's definitely the Murtlap.

455
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:20,406
You must be particularly susceptible.

456
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,742
See, you're a Muggle,

457
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,244
so our physiologies are subtly different.

458
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,294
Ew!

459
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:36,339
- Stay still.
- Ah...

460
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,007
That should stop the sweating.

461
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:39,967
And one of those should sort the twitch.

462
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,559
- Here, take that.
- Ugh...

463
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,025
Come on.

464
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:58,402
Whatcha got there?

465
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:02,198
This, the locals call Swooping Evil.

466
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,700
<i>Not the friendliest of names.</i>

467
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,911
It's quite an agile fella.

468
00:38:10,957 --> 00:38:13,042
<i>I've been studying him,
and I'm pretty sure</i>

469
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,753
that his venom
could be quite useful if properly diluted.

470
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,255
Just to remove bad memories, you know?

471
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:28,432
Probably shouldn't let him
loose in here, though.

472
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:31,602
<i>Come on.</i>

473
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,578
Come on. Down you come.

474
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,419
Come on.

475
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:06,095
Thank Paracelsus.

476
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:10,599
If you'd have got out,
that could've been quite catastrophic.

477
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:13,561
So he's the real reason I came to America.

478
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,692
To bring Frank home.

479
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,022
<i>Wait. No, sorry. Stay there.</i>

480
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,230
He's a wee bit sensitive to strangers.

481
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,075
Here you are. Here you are.

482
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:30,494
He was trafficked, you see.

483
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:33,998
I found him in Egypt.
He was all chained up.

484
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:37,418
Couldn't leave him there.
I had to bring him back.

485
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:40,254
I'm gonna put you back
where you belong, aren't I, Frank?

486
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:44,633
To the wilds of Arizona.

487
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:23,881
All right, here they come.

488
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:26,967
Here who comes?

489
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,344
Graphorns.

490
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:31,013
- Hey!
- You're all right.

491
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,643
- <i>Oh!</i>
- Hello.

492
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,186
Hello.

493
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,982
So they're the last
breeding pair in existence.

494
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:44,777
So if I hadn't managed to rescue them,

495
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:47,404
that could've been
the end of Graphorns forever.

496
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:53,661
All right.

497
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,584
<i>What, you rescue these creatures?</i>

498
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:03,587
<i>Yes, that's right.
Rescue, nurture and protect them.</i>

499
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:06,194
<i>And I'm gently trying to educate
my fellow wizards about them.</i>

500
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,759
Come on.

501
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:17,476
Wow.

502
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:21,564
Titus, Finn, Poppy, Marlow, Tom.

503
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,903
He had a cold.

504
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,697
He needed some body warmth.

505
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:30,865
<i>Aww...</i>

506
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:32,908
All right, on you hop.

507
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:38,455
He has some attachment issues.

508
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,916
Now, come on, Pickett.

509
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:43,836
Pickett.

510
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:46,755
No, they're not gonna bully you,
now come on.

511
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:48,799
Pickett.

512
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:50,759
All right.

513
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:55,306
And that is exactly why
they accuse me of favoritism.

514
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,933
Oh, no, Dougal's gone.

515
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:01,395
<i>All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.</i>

516
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,480
Mum's here. Mum's here.

517
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:04,899
Oh, hello.

518
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:06,859
Let me take a look at you.

519
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:09,612
I know these guys.

520
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:13,574
Your Occamy.

521
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:16,410
- What do you mean, my Occamy?
<i>- Yes.</i>

522
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:18,454
Do you want to...

523
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:21,165
Oh... Oh, wow, yeah, sure.

524
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:22,499
Okay.

525
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:29,965
Hey.

526
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,302
- Ahh!
- Oh, sorry, no, don't pet him.

527
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,804
They, um, learn to
defend themselves early.

528
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:38,691
See, their shells are made of silver,
so they're incredibly valuable.

529
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:39,850
Okay.

530
00:42:40,017 --> 00:42:42,186
Their nests tend to get
ransacked by hunters.

531
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:43,812
Thank you.

532
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:46,815
Mr. Scamander?

533
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:48,025
Oh, call me Newt.

534
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:51,028
<i>Newt. I don't think I'm dreaming.</i>

535
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:52,738
What gave it away?

536
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:55,574
I ain't got the brains to make this up.

537
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:02,289
Would you mind throwing some of those pellets
in with the Mooncalfs over there?

538
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:06,001
- Yeah, sure.
<i>- Just over there's...</i>

539
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,006
Bugger.

540
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:12,758
Niffler's gone.

541
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:14,677
<i>Course he has, little bugger.</i>

542
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,638
<i>Any chance to get his hands
on something shiny.</i>

543
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,885
What did you do today, Jacob?

544
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:58,679
I was inside a suitcase.

545
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:00,222
Hey.

546
00:44:00,723 --> 00:44:01,890
Oh, hello, fellas.

547
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,851
All right. All right.

548
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:06,687
Take it easy. Take it easy.

549
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:18,741
Cutie!
There it is.

550
00:45:04,036 --> 00:45:05,204
<i>Step back.</i>

551
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:07,498
<i>Step back.</i>

552
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:11,418
- What's the matter with this?
- I said, step away.

553
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:14,713
What the hell is this thing?

554
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,132
It's an Obscurus.

555
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,551
I need to get going.

556
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:22,262
Find everyone who's escaped,
before they get hurt.

557
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:23,555
Before they get hurt?

558
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:24,807
Yes, Mr. Kowalski.

559
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,767
So they're currently in alien terrain

560
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:29,978
surrounded by millions of the most
vicious creatures on the planet.

561
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:33,649
Humans.

562
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:38,779
So where would you say
that a medium-sized creature

563
00:45:38,946 --> 00:45:42,658
who likes broad open plains,
trees, sort of waterholes, that sort of thing.

564
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,159
Where might she go?

565
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:45,494
In New York City?

566
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:47,830
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Plains?

567
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,124
Central Park.

568
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:51,875
And where is that exactly?

569
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:53,335
Where is Central Park?

570
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,508
Well, look...

571
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:00,843
I would come and show you,

572
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:02,889
but don't you think it's kind
of a double-cross?

573
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,889
The girls take us in,
they make us hot cocoa...

574
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:07,325
Now you do realize that once they see

575
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,661
that you stopped sweating,
they will Obliviate you in a heartbeat?

576
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:10,894
What's "Bliviate" mean?

577
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:13,605
It'll be like you wake up
and all memory of magic gone.

578
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:19,877
I won't remember any of this?

579
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,280
No.

580
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:27,911
All right, yeah, okay. I'll help you.

581
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:33,876
Come on, then.

582
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:54,229
Credence, where have you been?

583
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:59,943
I was looking for a place
for tomorrow's meeting.

584
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:05,115
There's a corner
on 32nd Street that could...

585
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:14,249
I'm sorry, Ma.

586
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,168
<i>I didn't realize it was so late.</i>

587
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,849
- I was watching you at dinner.
- Yeah.

588
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:15,644
People like you, don't they, Mr. Kowalski?

589
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,271
Oh.

590
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:20,315
Well, I'm sure people like you, too, huh?

591
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:22,651
Not really, no. I annoy people.

592
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:25,279
Ah.

593
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:27,656
Why did you decide to be a baker?

594
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:29,324
Well, um...

595
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:32,744
Because I'm dying
in that canning factory.

596
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:36,331
Everyone there's dying.
It just crushes the life out of you.

597
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:38,417
- Do you like canned food?
- No.

598
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:40,210
Yeah, me neither.

599
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:43,130
That's why I wanna make pastries.
You know, it makes people happy.

600
00:48:43,297 --> 00:48:44,631
We're going this way.

601
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:46,675
So did you get your loan?

602
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:48,719
No.

603
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:50,554
I ain't got no collateral.

604
00:48:50,721 --> 00:48:52,848
Stayed in the army too long, apparently.
I don't know.

605
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:54,474
You fought in the war?

606
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,744
Of course I fought in the war.
Everyone fought in the war.

607
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:59,354
- You didn't fight in the war?
- I worked mostly with dragons.

608
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:00,689
Ukrainian Ironbellies.

609
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:02,524
Eastern Front.

610
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:33,263
<i>Fenestra.</i>

611
00:49:34,556 --> 00:49:35,557
Oh!

612
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:37,285
<i>Accio.</i>

613
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:59,141
<i>All right. Happy?</i>

614
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:03,270
One down, two to go.

615
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:15,115
They went that way, officer.

616
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:17,200
Hands up.

617
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:22,664
What the hell is that?

618
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:26,960
Lion.

619
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:37,512
<i>You know,</i>

620
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:41,266
New York is considerably
more interesting than I'd expected.

621
00:51:57,491 --> 00:51:58,867
Put this on.

622
00:51:59,493 --> 00:52:02,454
But why would I have to wear
something like this?

623
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:05,832
Because your skull is susceptible
to breakage under immense force.

624
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:28,438
But we made 'em cocoa.

625
00:52:30,941 --> 00:52:31,942
All right.

626
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:38,406
Here, you just, um, pop this on.

627
00:52:39,366 --> 00:52:40,575
Okay.

628
00:52:40,742 --> 00:52:43,787
Now there's absolutely
nothing for you to worry about.

629
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:47,290
Tell me, has anyone ever believed you
when you told them not to worry?

630
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:50,585
Well, my philosophy is that
worrying means you suffer twice.

631
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:57,425
She's in season.

632
00:52:57,926 --> 00:52:59,970
<i>She needs to mate.</i>

633
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:06,935
Erumpent musk. She's mad for it.

634
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:17,047
Good girl.

635
00:54:18,632 --> 00:54:19,799
Come on.

636
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:21,259
Into the case.

637
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:32,520
Get!

638
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:39,986
Oh, no.

639
00:55:08,515 --> 00:55:09,715
<i>Reparo.</i>

640
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:13,520
Merlin's beard!

641
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:19,693
Tree!

642
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:21,736
They're exactly the same.

643
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:24,489
Same thing.

644
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:26,032
Newt!

645
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:31,496
No, don't.

646
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:34,374
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

647
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:35,018
Good show, Mr. Kowalski.

648
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,022
Call me Jacob.

649
00:56:47,614 --> 00:56:50,784
Well... Two down, one to go.

650
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:56,873
<i>In you hop.</i>

651
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:14,541
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

652
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:17,769
<i>Tonight's keynote speaker</i>

653
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,022
<i>needs no introduction from me.</i>

654
00:57:21,523 --> 00:57:24,109
<i>He's been mentioned as a future president.</i>

655
00:57:25,527 --> 00:57:27,320
<i>And if you don't believe me,</i>

656
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:28,822
<i>just read his daddy's newspapers.</i>

657
00:57:32,826 --> 00:57:33,952
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

658
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:37,956
<i>I give you the senator
for New York, Henry Shaw.</i>

659
00:57:43,753 --> 00:57:44,796
Thank you.

660
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:47,549
<i>Thank you.</i>

661
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:53,138
<i>Thank you.</i>

662
00:58:17,871 --> 00:58:19,080
<i>And it's true,</i>

663
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:21,541
<i>we have made some progress.</i>

664
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:25,253
<i>But there is no reward
for idleness.</i>

665
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:30,717
<i>So just as the odious saloons
have been banished...</i>

666
00:58:44,314 --> 00:58:49,861
<i>So now the pool halls,
and these private parlors...</i>

667
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:02,916
What is that?

668
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:21,309
No! No!

669
00:59:53,758 --> 00:59:54,884
Witches.

670
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:06,437
<i>Our American friends
have permitted a breach</i>

671
01:00:07,063 --> 01:00:11,484
of the Statute of Secrecy that
threatens to expose us all.

672
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:13,069
I will not be lectured by the man

673
01:00:13,236 --> 01:00:15,446
who let Gellert Grindelwald
slip through his fingers.

674
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:19,575
Madam President, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but this is critical...

675
01:00:33,006 --> 01:00:34,733
<i>You better have
an excellent excuse</i>

676
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:36,759
for this intrusion, Ms. Goldstein.

677
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:39,554
Yes. I do.

678
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:43,891
<i>Ma'am,</i>

679
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:48,563
yesterday a wizard entered New York
with a case, this case,

680
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:49,897
full of magical creatures.

681
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:52,108
And unfortunately, some have escaped.

682
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:54,152
He arrived yesterday?

683
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:57,780
<i>You've known for 24 hours</i>

684
01:00:57,947 --> 01:01:01,868
that an unregistered wizard
set magical beasts loose in New York,

685
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:04,662
and you see fit to tell us
only when a man has been killed?

686
01:01:07,332 --> 01:01:08,458
Who's been killed?

687
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:10,877
Where is this man?

688
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:52,251
<i>Scamander?</i>

689
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:56,339
Oh, hello, Minister.

690
01:01:56,506 --> 01:01:57,632
<i>Theseus Scamander?</i>

691
01:01:57,799 --> 01:01:58,966
The war hero?

692
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:01,010
No. This is his little brother.

693
01:02:01,636 --> 01:02:03,679
<i>And what are you doing in New York?</i>

694
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:05,807
I came to buy an Appaloosa Puffskein, sir.

695
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:07,183
Right.

696
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,810
What are you really doing here?

697
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:11,437
<i>Goldstein,</i>

698
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:12,814
who is this?

699
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:15,373
This is Jacob Kowalski, Madam President.

700
01:02:15,483 --> 01:02:18,069
He's a No-Maj who got bitten
by one of Mr. Scamander's creatures.

701
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:20,488
<i>No-Maj? Obliviate him.</i>

702
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:22,115
<i>Obliviate him.</i>

703
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:27,161
Merlin's beard.

704
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:31,499
You know which of your creatures
was responsible, Mr. Scamander?

705
01:02:36,504 --> 01:02:38,047
No creature did this.

706
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,758
Don't pretend.

707
01:02:41,509 --> 01:02:43,428
You must know what that was.
Look at the marks.

708
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:49,707
That was an Obscurus.

709
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:54,897
<i>You go too far, Mr. Scamander.</i>

710
01:02:55,982 --> 01:02:58,359
There is no Obscurial in America.

711
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:02,864
Impound that case, Graves.

712
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:05,546
- Wait, no. Give that back.
<i>- Arrest them.</i>

713
01:03:10,872 --> 01:03:12,540
Don't hurt those creatures.

714
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:15,543
Please. You don't understand.
Nothing in there's dangerous.

715
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:17,879
- Nothing.
- We'll be the judges of that.

716
01:03:18,379 --> 01:03:19,714
<i>Take them to the cells.</i>

717
01:03:20,882 --> 01:03:23,968
<i>Don't hurt those creatures.
Nothing in there is dangerous.</i>

718
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:26,589
Please don't hurt my creatures.
They aren't dangerous!

719
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:28,639
<i>Please! They're not dangerous!</i>

720
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:30,766
<i>They're not dangerous!</i>

721
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:41,527
I'm so sorry about your creatures,
Mr. Scamander.

722
01:03:42,445 --> 01:03:43,863
<i>I truly am.</i>

723
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:46,780
Can someone please tell me

724
01:03:46,908 --> 01:03:50,077
what this Obscurial,
Obscurius thing is, please?

725
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:54,415
There hasn't been one for centuries.

726
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:58,794
I met one in Sudan three months ago.

727
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:03,841
<i>There used to be more of them,
but they still exist.</i>

728
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:09,430
It was before wizards went underground,

729
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:13,100
when we were still
being hunted by Muggles.

730
01:04:14,227 --> 01:04:17,897
Young wizards and witches
sometimes tried to suppress their magic

731
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:19,607
to avoid persecution.

732
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:24,612
<i>So, instead of learning to harness
or to control their powers,</i>

733
01:04:25,988 --> 01:04:28,950
they developed
what was called an Obscurus.

734
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:34,163
It's an unstable,
uncontrollable dark force

735
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:36,332
that busts out and attacks.

736
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:41,337
And then vanishes.

737
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:47,343
<i>Obscurials can't survive long, can they?</i>

738
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:51,806
There's no documented case of an Obscurial
surviving past the age of 10.

739
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,726
The one I met in Africa was 8 when she...

740
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:02,149
She was 8 when she died.

741
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:06,988
What are you telling me here?

742
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:10,950
That Senator Shaw was killed by a kid?

743
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:19,834
<i>My momma, your momma</i>
<i>Flying on a switch</i>

744
01:05:20,001 --> 01:05:23,504
<i>My momma, your momma
Witches never cry</i>

745
01:05:23,671 --> 01:05:26,966
<i>My momma, your momma
Witches gonna die</i>

746
01:05:27,592 --> 01:05:30,845
<i>Witch number one,
drown in the river</i>

747
01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:33,723
<i>Witch number two,
got a noose...</i>

748
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:35,725
<i>Hand out your leaflets.</i>

749
01:05:36,726 --> 01:05:38,185
I'll know if you dump them.

750
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:41,564
Tell me if you see anything suspicious.

751
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:13,721
It was good to make
your acquaintance, Jacob.

752
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:16,057
<i>And I hope you get your bakery.</i>

753
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,254
You're an interesting man,
Mr. Scamander.

754
01:06:29,278 --> 01:06:30,696
Mr. Graves.

755
01:06:39,664 --> 01:06:42,583
You were thrown out of Hogwarts
for endangering human life.

756
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,919
- That was an accident.
- With a beast.

757
01:06:45,711 --> 01:06:49,256
Yet one of your teachers argued strongly
against your expulsion.

758
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:54,845
Now, what makes Albus Dumbledore

759
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:57,181
so fond of you?

760
01:07:02,228 --> 01:07:03,688
I really couldn't say.

761
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:06,941
So setting a pack
of dangerous creatures loose here was

762
01:07:10,403 --> 01:07:12,905
just another accident. Is that right?

763
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:15,104
Why would I do it deliberately?

764
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:17,243
To expose wizardkind.

765
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:21,122
To provoke war between
the magical and non-magical worlds.

766
01:07:21,956 --> 01:07:24,834
Mass slaughter
for the greater good, you mean?

767
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:28,462
Yes.

768
01:07:29,714 --> 01:07:30,715
<i>Quite.</i>

769
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:35,636
I'm not one of Grindelwald's
fanatics, Mr. Graves.

770
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:43,561
I wonder what you can tell me
about this, Mr. Scamander.

771
01:07:57,742 --> 01:07:59,368
It's an Obscurus.

772
01:07:59,994 --> 01:08:01,162
But it's not what you think.

773
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:03,247
I managed to separate it
from the Sudanese girl

774
01:08:03,456 --> 01:08:04,498
<i>as I tried to save her.</i>

775
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:06,625
<i>So I wanted to take it home to study it.</i>

776
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:08,210
<i>But it cannot survive outside that.</i>

777
01:08:08,377 --> 01:08:10,171
<i>It could not hurt anyone, Tina.</i>

778
01:08:10,463 --> 01:08:12,298
So it's useless without the host?

779
01:08:13,174 --> 01:08:14,508
Useless?

780
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:17,178
Useless?

781
01:08:19,722 --> 01:08:23,893
That is a parasitical,
magical force that killed a child.

782
01:08:24,059 --> 01:08:26,145
What on earth would you use it for?

783
01:08:32,777 --> 01:08:34,695
You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.

784
01:08:34,862 --> 01:08:36,673
You brought this Obscurus
into the City of New York

785
01:08:36,697 --> 01:08:38,616
in the hope of causing mass disruption,

786
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:41,660
breaking the Statute of Secrecy
and revealing the magical world.

787
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,138
You know that can't hurt anyone.
You know that.

788
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:44,973
You are therefore guilty of
a treasonous betrayal

789
01:08:44,997 --> 01:08:47,041
of your fellow wizards
and are sentenced to death.

790
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,630
Miss Goldstein,
who has aided and abetted you...

791
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:51,212
No, she's done nothing of the kind.

792
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:53,214
Receives the same sentence.

793
01:08:55,591 --> 01:08:56,926
Just do it immediately.

794
01:08:57,092 --> 01:08:59,261
- I will inform President Picquery myself.
- Tina.

795
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,222
Shh.

796
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:02,556
Please.

797
01:09:16,237 --> 01:09:18,906
Don't do this, Bernadette. Please.

798
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:21,742
It don't hurt.

799
01:09:58,904 --> 01:09:59,947
Tina.

800
01:10:00,114 --> 01:10:01,198
<i>Momma?</i>

801
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:03,742
<i>Tina.</i>

802
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:07,872
Come on, pumpkin. Time for bed.

803
01:10:08,581 --> 01:10:09,957
Are you ready?

804
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:12,793
Don't that look good?

805
01:10:17,298 --> 01:10:18,674
You wanna get in, huh?

806
01:10:27,808 --> 01:10:28,934
Hey, Sam.

807
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:30,781
- Hey, Queenie.
- They need you downstairs.

808
01:10:30,853 --> 01:10:32,062
I'll Obliviate this guy.

809
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:33,606
You ain't qualified.

810
01:10:35,316 --> 01:10:36,525
Hey, Sam.

811
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:38,861
Does Cecily know you been seeing Ruby?

812
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,966
- How did you...
- Let me Obliviate this guy,

813
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:44,700
and she'll never hear about it from me.

814
01:10:48,829 --> 01:10:49,997
What are you doing?

815
01:10:50,164 --> 01:10:52,666
Hush. Teen's in trouble.
I'm trying to listen.

816
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,376
Jacob, where's Newt's case?

817
01:10:54,543 --> 01:10:56,462
I think that guy Graves took it.

818
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:58,380
Okay. Come on.

819
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:00,341
What, you're not gonna Obliviate me?

820
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:04,136
Of course not. You're one of us now.

821
01:11:09,141 --> 01:11:10,768
<i>Tina.</i>

822
01:11:32,414 --> 01:11:33,916
It's okay.

823
01:11:43,717 --> 01:11:45,010
<i>Alohomora.</i>

824
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,056
<i>Aberto.</i>

825
01:11:50,224 --> 01:11:52,393
He would know
some fancy spell to lock his office.

826
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:58,607
Okay, let's get the good stuff outta you.

827
01:12:18,711 --> 01:12:20,004
Witch!

828
01:12:30,097 --> 01:12:32,266
Mr. Scamander!

829
01:12:32,808 --> 01:12:34,101
Don't panic.

830
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:35,894
What do you suggest I do instead?

831
01:12:41,316 --> 01:12:42,401
Jump.

832
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,238
Are you crazy?

833
01:12:47,031 --> 01:12:48,240
Jump on him.

834
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:52,745
<i>Tina, listen to me.</i>

835
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,455
I'll catch you.

836
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:56,749
<i>Tina.</i>

837
01:13:02,921 --> 01:13:04,214
I'll catch you.

838
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:06,842
<i>I've got you, Tina.</i>

839
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,344
Go!

840
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:15,517
Come on.

841
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,664
Leave his brains. Come on. Come on!

842
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:41,835
What is that thing?

843
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:43,087
Swooping Evil.

844
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:44,880
Well, I love it.

845
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:00,437
Get in.

846
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:12,616
Queenie!

847
01:14:18,038 --> 01:14:19,206
Where you going?

848
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:21,708
I, uh...

849
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,794
I'm sick, Mr. Abernathy.

850
01:14:25,921 --> 01:14:27,047
Again?

851
01:14:27,381 --> 01:14:28,382
Oh. Uh...

852
01:14:29,049 --> 01:14:30,217
Whatcha got there?

853
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:32,761
Ladies' things.

854
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,472
You wanna take a look?
I don't mind.

855
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:39,268
Good gravy. No. I, uh...

856
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:41,770
You get well now.

857
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:44,022
Thanks.

858
01:14:58,078 --> 01:14:59,872
Credence, have you found the child?

859
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:03,292
I can't.

860
01:15:04,376 --> 01:15:05,752
Show me.

861
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:18,182
My boy, the sooner we find this child,

862
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:21,602
the sooner you can put that pain
in the past where it belongs.

863
01:15:23,854 --> 01:15:25,814
I want you to have this, Credence.

864
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:30,068
I would trust very few with it.

865
01:15:32,404 --> 01:15:33,739
Very few.

866
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,118
But you...

867
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:41,997
You're different.

868
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:45,292
And when you find the child,
you touch this symbol,

869
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:47,502
and I will know and I will come to you.

870
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:53,300
Do this, and you will be honored

871
01:15:54,301 --> 01:15:57,137
among wizards forever.

872
01:16:00,057 --> 01:16:01,975
The child is dying, Credence.

873
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:07,564
Time is running out.

874
01:16:20,285 --> 01:16:22,537
Your grandfather kept pigeons?

875
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:24,039
Mine bred owls.

876
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:27,334
I used to love feeding them.

877
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:31,421
Graves always insisted
the disturbances were caused by a beast.

878
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:33,107
We need to catch all your creatures

879
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:35,217
so he can't
keep using them as a scapegoat.

880
01:16:35,384 --> 01:16:37,261
There's only one still missing.

881
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:38,845
Dougal, my Demiguise.

882
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:40,764
Dougal?

883
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:44,851
Slight problem is that,
um, he's invisible.

884
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:49,147
- Invisible?
- Yes.

885
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,692
Most of the time. He does, um...

886
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:57,364
- How do you catch something...
- With immense difficulty.

887
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:01,618
Oh.

888
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:08,792
Gnarlak.

889
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:10,877
- Excuse me?
- Gnarlak.

890
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:14,047
He was an informant of mine
when I was an Auror.

891
01:17:14,756 --> 01:17:17,634
He used to trade
in magical creatures on the side.

892
01:17:18,552 --> 01:17:21,221
He wouldn't happen to have an interest
in paw prints, would he?

893
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:25,976
He's interested in anything he can sell.

What? Ain't you ever seen
a house-elf before?

902
01:18:27,788 --> 01:18:31,583
Uh, no, of course I have.
I love house-elves.

903
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:33,668

Yeah.

Are all No-Majs like you?

907
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:55,649
No. I'm the only one like me.

908
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:16,545
I've arrested half of the people in here.

909
01:19:17,254 --> 01:19:18,648
You can tell me to mind my business,

910
01:19:18,672 --> 01:19:22,551
but I saw something
in that death potion back there.

911
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:26,680
I saw you hugging that Second Salem boy.

912
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:29,349
His name's Credence.

913
01:19:30,892 --> 01:19:32,310
His mother beats him.

914
01:19:35,147 --> 01:19:36,707
She beats all those kids she's adopted,

915
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:39,025
but she seems to hate him the most.

916
01:19:41,027 --> 01:19:42,863
And she was the No-Maj you attacked?

917
01:19:44,573 --> 01:19:46,241
That's how I lost my job.

918
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:50,203
I went for her in front of a meeting
of her crazy followers.

919
01:19:51,413 --> 01:19:53,039
They all had to be Obliviated.

920
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:54,374
It was a big scandal.

921
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,084

You're the guy

925
01:20:11,892 --> 01:20:13,351
News travels fast.

926
01:20:14,895 --> 01:20:18,982
I was hoping you'd be able to tell me
if there've been any sightings.

927
01:20:20,108 --> 01:20:21,610
Tracks, that sort of thing.

928
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:27,032
You got a pretty big price
on your head, Mr. Scamander.

929
01:20:28,116 --> 01:20:29,576
Why should I help you

Um... Let's consider it a cover charge.

933
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:46,426

01:21:25,632 --> 01:21:28,343

<i>One last thing.</i>

956
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:11,052
There's a Mr. Graves who works at MACUSA.

01:22:11,886 --> 01:22:13,972
<i>I was wondering what you knew
of his background.</i>

958
01:22:14,139 --> 01:22:18,476
You ask a lot of questions, Mr. Scamander.

959
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:21,354
That can get you killed.

960
01:22:25,066 --> 01:22:26,318
MACUSA are comin'.

961
01:22:26,651 --> 01:22:27,861
You tipped them off?

962
01:22:36,286 --> 01:22:37,912
Sorry, Mr. Gnarlak.

963
01:22:40,749 --> 01:22:42,208
He reminds me of my foreman.

964

965
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:24,531
Where'd you get this?

966
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:26,127
Give it back, Credence.

967
01:23:26,294 --> 01:23:28,046
It's just a toy.

968
01:23:32,759 --> 01:23:34,260
What is this?

969
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:39,933
<i>Take it off.</i>

970
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:07,711
- Ma...
- I am not your ma.

971
01:24:09,796 --> 01:24:14,968
Your mother was a wicked, unnatural woman.

972

01:25:30,168 --> 01:25:32,837
but they can give a nasty nip if provoked.

977
01:25:34,714 --> 01:25:35,840
<i>You two,</i>

978
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:37,550
head that way.

979
01:25:37,926 --> 01:25:40,220
And try very hard not to be predictable.

980
01:25:45,558 --> 01:25:47,852
<i>- Was that the Demiguise?
- No.</i>

981
01:25:48,019 --> 01:25:50,605
<i>But I think it might be the reason
that the Demiguise is here.</i>

982
01:26:05,954 --> 01:26:08,081
<i>Its sight operates on probability,</i>

983
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:11,417
so it can foresee
the most likely immediate future.

984
01:26:13,503 --> 01:26:14,963
<i>What's it doing?</i>

985
01:26:16,506 --> 01:26:17,841
He's babysitting.

986
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:20,718
What did you just say?

987
01:26:20,885 --> 01:26:21,928
<i>This is my fault.</i>

988
01:26:24,055 --> 01:26:27,934
I thought I had them all
but, uh, I must have miscounted.

989
01:26:32,647 --> 01:26:33,940
It was babysitting that?

990
01:26:47,287 --> 01:26:49,873
Occamies are choranaptyxic.

991
01:26:50,957 --> 01:26:53,501
So they grow to fill available space.

992
01:26:58,131 --> 01:26:59,424
Mummy's here.

993
01:27:13,646 --> 01:27:14,647
Whoa. Whoa!

994
01:27:15,815 --> 01:27:16,816
Whoa!

995
01:27:20,528 --> 01:27:23,031
- We need an insect!
- Huh?

996
01:27:23,323 --> 01:27:25,575
Any kind of insect and a teapot.

997
01:27:27,118 --> 01:27:28,578
Find a teapot!

998
01:27:32,916 --> 01:27:34,876
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

999
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,017
Oh! No!

1000
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:53,227
I got it! I'll get it!

1001
01:27:56,856 --> 01:27:57,857
Teapot!

1002
01:28:11,412 --> 01:28:13,706
Roach in teapot.

1003
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:10,263
Choranaptyxic.

1004
01:29:11,806 --> 01:29:14,267
They also shrink
to fit the available space.

1005
01:29:19,856 --> 01:29:21,149
Tell me the truth.

1006
01:29:22,984 --> 01:29:25,028
Was that everything
that came out of the case?

1007
01:29:25,778 --> 01:29:27,280
That's everything.

1008
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:30,158
And that's the truth.

1009
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,329
<i>Here she comes.</i>

1010
01:29:36,456 --> 01:29:38,332
You happy to be home? Yeah.

1011
01:29:38,499 --> 01:29:40,043
Bet you're exhausted, buddy. Come on.

1012
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:41,609
Just place him in the middle there.

1013
01:29:41,794 --> 01:29:43,755
There you go. That's right.

1014
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:07,361
Ow.

1015
01:30:10,114 --> 01:30:11,282
Right.

1016
01:30:11,824 --> 01:30:13,326
I think we need to talk.

1017
01:30:18,414 --> 01:30:20,166
I wouldn't have let him keep you, Pickett.

1018
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:22,936
Think I would rather chop off my hand
than get rid of you

1019
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,338
after everything that you've done for me.
Now, come on.

1020
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:29,592
Think we've talked about
the sulking before, haven't we?

1021
01:30:30,676 --> 01:30:31,677
Pickett?

1022
01:30:34,097 --> 01:30:35,348
Come on, give me a smile.

1023
01:30:35,765 --> 01:30:37,445
Pickett, give me a...

1024
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,186
All right.

1025
01:30:40,812 --> 01:30:42,188
Now that is beneath you.

1026
01:30:50,071 --> 01:30:51,239
Hey, Newt.

1027
01:30:53,407 --> 01:30:54,742
Who is she?

1028
01:30:55,576 --> 01:30:56,786
Oh, that's no one.

1029
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,540
Leta Lestrange.

1030
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,543
<i>I've heard of that family.</i>

1031
01:31:04,961 --> 01:31:07,630
Aren't they kind of, you know...

1032
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:09,715
Please don't read my mind.

1033
01:31:21,185 --> 01:31:22,854
Sorry, I asked you not to.

1034
01:31:23,813 --> 01:31:25,481
I know. I'm sorry.

1035
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:27,859
I can't help it.

1036
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:31,070
People are easiest to read
when they're hurting.

1037
01:31:31,237 --> 01:31:32,363
<i>I'm not hurting.</i>

1038
01:31:34,157 --> 01:31:35,950
Anyway, it was a long time ago.

1039
01:31:45,042 --> 01:31:47,670
That was a real close friendship
you had at school.

1040
01:31:50,339 --> 01:31:52,633
Neither of us really fitted in at school.

1041
01:31:54,468 --> 01:31:56,596
- So, we became quite...
<i>- You became real close?</i>

1042
01:31:58,890 --> 01:32:00,099
For years.

1043
01:32:04,395 --> 01:32:05,771
She was a taker.

1044
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:09,275
<i>You need a giver.</i>

1045
01:32:10,193 --> 01:32:11,944
What are you two talking about?

1046
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:14,030
<i>Uh, nothing.</i>

1047
01:32:14,697 --> 01:32:15,823
<i>School.</i>

1048
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:17,617
- School.
<i>- Did...</i>

1049
01:32:18,451 --> 01:32:19,785
Did you say school?

1050
01:32:20,745 --> 01:32:21,954
Is there a school?

1051
01:32:22,121 --> 01:32:25,499
A wizardry school here in, uh, America?

1052
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,710
Of course. Ilvermorny.

1053
01:32:27,877 --> 01:32:30,463
It's only the best wizard school
in the whole world.

1054
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:34,300
I think you'll find that the best
wizarding school in the world is Hogwarts.

1055
01:32:35,134 --> 01:32:36,177
Hogwash.

1056
01:32:46,646 --> 01:32:47,647
<i>Danger.</i>

1057
01:32:50,858 --> 01:32:52,652
He senses danger.

1058
01:33:32,483 --> 01:33:34,986
The Obscurial was here.

1059
01:33:35,444 --> 01:33:36,529
Where did she go?

1060
01:33:39,407 --> 01:33:40,700
Help me.

1061
01:33:42,118 --> 01:33:43,411
Help me.

1062
01:33:46,038 --> 01:33:48,291
Didn't you tell me you had another sister?

1063
01:33:50,209 --> 01:33:51,711
Please, help me.

1064
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:54,505
- Where's your other sister, Credence?
- I need help.

1065
01:33:54,672 --> 01:33:56,549
The little one. Where did she go?

1066
01:33:56,716 --> 01:33:58,676
Please, just help me.

1067
01:34:00,886 --> 01:34:03,723
Your sister's in grave danger.

1068
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:06,600
We need to find her.

1069
01:34:15,985 --> 01:34:17,445
What is this place?

1070
01:34:17,778 --> 01:34:19,947
Ma adopted Modesty out of here.

1071
01:34:20,114 --> 01:34:21,741
From a family of 12.

1072
01:34:22,575 --> 01:34:25,786
She misses her brothers and sisters.
She still talks about them.

1073
01:34:28,247 --> 01:34:29,749
Where is she?

1074
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:32,752
I don't know.

1075
01:34:34,503 --> 01:34:35,880
You're a Squib, Credence.

1076
01:34:37,131 --> 01:34:39,675
I could smell it off you
the minute I met you.

1077
01:34:40,926 --> 01:34:41,927
What?

1078
01:34:43,596 --> 01:34:45,848
You have magical ancestry but no power.

1079
01:34:46,974 --> 01:34:48,434
But you said you could teach me.

1080
01:34:48,601 --> 01:34:49,852
<i>You're unteachable.</i>

1081
01:34:50,519 --> 01:34:51,520
<i>Your mother's dead.</i>

1082
01:34:52,313 --> 01:34:53,606
That's your reward.

1083
01:34:54,982 --> 01:34:56,442
I'm done with you.

1084
01:35:05,242 --> 01:35:06,577
Modesty?

1085
01:35:18,547 --> 01:35:20,007
<i>Modesty.</i>

1086
01:35:21,217 --> 01:35:25,304
There's no need to be afraid.

1087
01:35:27,098 --> 01:35:29,350
I'm here with your brother, Credence.

1088
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,023
Out you come now.

1089
01:36:11,308 --> 01:36:12,351
Credence.

1090
01:36:13,727 --> 01:36:15,938
<i>I owe you an apology.</i>

1091
01:36:16,856 --> 01:36:18,566
I trusted you.

1092
01:36:21,777 --> 01:36:23,237
I thought you were my friend.

1093
01:36:23,988 --> 01:36:25,531
I thought you were different.

1094
01:36:27,867 --> 01:36:29,368
You can control it.

1095
01:36:30,453 --> 01:36:31,620
Credence.

1096
01:36:36,959 --> 01:36:39,336
I don't think I want to, Mr. Graves.

1097
01:37:04,904 --> 01:37:07,281
Is that it?
That's the Obscurial thing?

1098
01:37:09,325 --> 01:37:11,785
That's more powerful
than any Obscurial I've ever heard of.

1099
01:37:16,081 --> 01:37:17,875
If I don't come back,

1100
01:37:18,042 --> 01:37:19,502
look after my creatures.

1101
01:37:20,461 --> 01:37:23,464
Everything that you need to know
is in there.

1102
01:37:24,632 --> 01:37:25,841
What?

1103
01:37:26,008 --> 01:37:27,801
They're not killing it.

1104
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:31,472
Newt!

1105
01:37:32,389 --> 01:37:34,308
You heard him. Look after them.

1106
01:37:36,268 --> 01:37:37,603
Keep hold of that, honey.

1107
01:37:37,978 --> 01:37:40,731
No, no, no, no.

1108
01:37:41,190 --> 01:37:42,775
I can't take you.

1109
01:37:43,901 --> 01:37:46,779
- Please, let go of me, Jacob.
- Hey. Hey.

1110
01:37:47,112 --> 01:37:49,281
You're the one
that said I was one of yous.

1111
01:37:49,573 --> 01:37:50,616
Right?

1112
01:37:50,783 --> 01:37:52,618
It's too dangerous.

1113
01:38:22,731 --> 01:38:24,650
<i>To survive so long</i>

1114
01:38:25,985 --> 01:38:28,320
with this inside you, Credence,

1115
01:38:29,697 --> 01:38:30,823
is a miracle.

1116
01:38:31,407 --> 01:38:33,659
<i>You are a miracle.</i>

1117
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:36,370
Come with me.

1118
01:38:37,162 --> 01:38:39,665
Think of what we could achieve together.

1119
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:55,180
<i>Newt!</i>

1120
01:38:55,556 --> 01:38:57,356
It's the Second Salem boy.
He's the Obscurial.

1121
01:38:57,766 --> 01:38:59,143
He's not a child.

1122
01:38:59,768 --> 01:39:03,689
His power must be so strong
he's somehow managed to survive.

1123
01:39:08,152 --> 01:39:09,361
<i>Newt.</i>

1124
01:39:10,571 --> 01:39:11,739
Save him.

1125
01:39:19,204 --> 01:39:20,456
Mr. Graves.

1126
01:39:33,385 --> 01:39:35,846
Tina, you're always turning up
where you're least wanted.

1127
01:39:48,484 --> 01:39:49,985
Contain this.

1128
01:39:50,527 --> 01:39:53,113
Or we are exposed, and it'll mean war.

1129
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:05,250
Credence.

1130
01:40:05,668 --> 01:40:07,127
Credence, I can help.

1131
01:41:46,685 --> 01:41:47,996
- Bar the area.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

1132
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:49,460
I don't want anyone else down there.

1133
01:42:02,242 --> 01:42:03,410
<i>Credence...</i>

1134
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:08,123
It is Credence, isn't it?

1135
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:13,545
<i>I'm here to help you, Credence.</i>

1136
01:42:14,546 --> 01:42:16,799
I'm not here to hurt you.

1137
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:39,071
I've met someone just like you, Credence.

1138
01:42:42,407 --> 01:42:43,659
<i>A girl.</i>

1139
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:46,161
<i>A young girl</i>

1140
01:42:46,578 --> 01:42:48,163
who'd been imprisoned.

1141
01:42:49,873 --> 01:42:54,086
She had been locked away,
and she'd been punished for her magic.

1142
01:43:12,229 --> 01:43:13,438
<i>Credence.</i>

1143
01:43:16,775 --> 01:43:18,151
Can I come over to you?

1144
01:43:21,822 --> 01:43:23,240
<i>Can I come over?</i>

1145
01:43:52,853 --> 01:43:54,938
That thing killed my son.

1146
01:43:55,147 --> 01:43:56,815
I want justice.

1147
01:43:57,649 --> 01:44:01,695
<i>I'll expose you
for who you are and what you've done.</i>

1148
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:26,970
Look! Take photos.

1149
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:56,124
Credence...

1150
01:45:35,414 --> 01:45:36,873
Credence, no!

1151
01:45:42,504 --> 01:45:44,089
Don't do this.

1152
01:45:45,007 --> 01:45:46,091
Please.

1153
01:45:47,426 --> 01:45:49,011
Keep talking, Tina.

1154
01:45:50,637 --> 01:45:52,723
Keep talking to him. He'll listen to you.

1155
01:45:53,223 --> 01:45:54,474
He's listening.

1156
01:45:57,352 --> 01:45:59,563
I know what that woman did to you.

1157
01:46:03,984 --> 01:46:06,153
<i>I know that you've suffered.</i>

1158
01:46:08,488 --> 01:46:11,033
You need to stop this now.

1159
01:46:12,993 --> 01:46:15,370
Newt and I will protect you.

1160
01:46:17,956 --> 01:46:21,626
This man, he's using you.

1161
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,480
<i>Don't listen to her, Credence.</i>

1162
01:46:24,504 --> 01:46:26,173
<i>I want you to be free.</i>

1163
01:46:27,632 --> 01:46:28,675
<i>It's all right.</i>

1164
01:46:30,343 --> 01:46:31,636
That's it.

1165
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:40,812
Shh!

1166
01:46:41,605 --> 01:46:42,647
<i>Don't!</i>

1167
01:46:42,814 --> 01:46:44,534
- You'll frighten him!
- Wands down!

1168
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:46,590
Anyone harms him, they answer to me.

1169
01:46:46,943 --> 01:46:48,945
- Credence.
- Credence.

1170
01:46:52,365 --> 01:46:53,533
<i>No!</i>

1171
01:47:28,026 --> 01:47:29,236
Credence.

1172
01:47:30,612 --> 01:47:32,030
<i>You fools.</i>

1173
01:47:34,032 --> 01:47:35,867
Do you realize what you've done?

1174
01:47:36,618 --> 01:47:39,579
The Obscurial was killed
on my orders, Mr. Graves.

1175
01:47:39,746 --> 01:47:41,039
<i>Yes.</i>

1176
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:43,834
And history will surely note that,
Madam President.

1177
01:47:45,502 --> 01:47:47,142
What was done here tonight was not right.

1178
01:47:47,254 --> 01:47:49,923
He was responsible
for the death of a No-Maj.

1179
01:47:50,382 --> 01:47:52,050
He risked the exposure of our community.

1180
01:47:52,217 --> 01:47:53,897
He has broken one of our most sacred laws.

1181
01:47:54,052 --> 01:47:57,681
A law that has us scuttling
like rats in the gutter.

1182
01:47:58,056 --> 01:48:00,058
<i>A law that demands that
we conceal our true nature.</i>

1183
01:48:00,725 --> 01:48:03,562
A law that directs those
under its dominion to cower in fear,

1184
01:48:03,728 --> 01:48:05,689
lest we risk discovery.

1185
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:10,277
<i>I ask you, Madam President,</i>

1186
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:13,572
I ask all of you...

1187
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:17,617
Who does this law protect?

1188
01:48:19,911 --> 01:48:21,204
Us?

1189
01:48:23,248 --> 01:48:24,624
Or them?

1190
01:48:31,715 --> 01:48:33,758
I refuse to bow down any longer.

1191
01:48:33,925 --> 01:48:35,010
Aurors,

1192
01:48:35,844 --> 01:48:38,346
I'd like you to relieve Mr. Graves
of his wand

1193
01:48:38,513 --> 01:48:39,890
and escort him back...

1194
01:49:13,673 --> 01:49:15,050
<i>Accio!</i>

1195
01:49:24,517 --> 01:49:25,727
<i>Revelio.</i>

1196
01:49:50,752 --> 01:49:53,338
Do you think you can hold me?

1197
01:49:55,173 --> 01:49:58,343
We'll do our best, Mr. Grindelwald.

1198
01:50:16,361 --> 01:50:19,322
Will we die just a little?

1199
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:31,543
Hey.

1200
01:50:32,752 --> 01:50:35,880
I figured somebody ought to
keep an eye on this thing.

1201
01:50:40,552 --> 01:50:41,553
Thank you.

1202
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:44,389
We owe you an apology, Mr. Scamander,

1203
01:50:45,307 --> 01:50:47,726
but the magical community is exposed.

1204
01:50:48,643 --> 01:50:51,229
<i>We cannot Obliviate an entire city.</i>

1205
01:50:56,526 --> 01:50:57,777
<i>Actually,</i>

1206
01:50:59,321 --> 01:51:00,739
I think we can.

1207
01:51:26,723 --> 01:51:29,559
I was intending to wait
until we got to Arizona.

1208
01:51:32,896 --> 01:51:35,690
But it seems that now
you're our only hope, Frank.

1209
01:51:54,876 --> 01:51:56,461
<i>I'll miss you, too.</i>

1210
01:52:08,932 --> 01:52:10,392
<i>You know what you gotta do.</i>

1211
01:54:38,248 --> 01:54:39,791
<i>They won't remember anything.</i>

1212
01:54:40,959 --> 01:54:44,337
That venom has incredibly powerful
Obliviative properties.

1213
01:54:46,881 --> 01:54:49,133
We owe you a great debt, Mr. Scamander.

1214
01:54:52,262 --> 01:54:55,682
Now, get that case out of New York.

1215
01:54:56,391 --> 01:54:57,809
Yes, Madam President.

1216
01:55:04,315 --> 01:55:05,984
Is that No-Maj still here?

1217
01:55:11,155 --> 01:55:12,490
Obliviate him.

1218
01:55:12,657 --> 01:55:14,117
There can be no exceptions.

1219
01:55:16,494 --> 01:55:18,913
I'm sorry, but even one witness...

1220
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:20,164
You know the law.

1221
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:26,337
I'll let you say goodbye.

1222
01:55:37,515 --> 01:55:38,641
Hey.

1223
01:55:41,311 --> 01:55:42,312
This is for the best.

1224
01:55:43,646 --> 01:55:45,523
Yeah. I was...

1225
01:55:46,774 --> 01:55:48,818
I was never even supposed to be here.

1226
01:55:49,777 --> 01:55:54,866
I was never supposed to know any of this.

1227
01:55:59,537 --> 01:56:01,914
Everybody knows Newt only
kept me around because...

1228
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:04,876
<i>Hey,</i>

1229
01:56:05,251 --> 01:56:08,046
Newt, why did you keep me around?

1230
01:56:09,631 --> 01:56:11,049
Because I like you.

1231
01:56:13,468 --> 01:56:15,345
Because you're my friend.

1232
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:19,098
<i>And I'll never forget
how you helped me, Jacob.</i>

1233
01:56:20,391 --> 01:56:21,726
Oh...

1234
01:56:22,435 --> 01:56:23,436
Hey...

1235
01:56:23,895 --> 01:56:25,104
I'll come with you.

1236
01:56:26,731 --> 01:56:28,900
We'll go somewhere. We'll go anywhere.

1237
01:56:30,234 --> 01:56:34,489
See, I ain't never gonna find anyone like you.

1238
01:56:37,408 --> 01:56:38,576
There's loads like me.

1239
01:56:38,743 --> 01:56:39,744
No.

1240
01:56:40,703 --> 01:56:41,704
No.

1241
01:56:43,081 --> 01:56:44,874
There's only one like you.

1242
01:56:51,089 --> 01:56:52,590
I gotta go.

1243
01:56:57,470 --> 01:56:58,554
Jacob...

1244
01:56:59,472 --> 01:57:01,099
It's okay. It's okay.

1245
01:57:04,102 --> 01:57:05,478
It's okay.

1246
01:57:10,024 --> 01:57:12,026
It's just like waking up, right?

1247
01:59:15,316 --> 01:59:16,876
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

1248
01:59:19,028 --> 01:59:20,112
Hey!

1249
01:59:34,252 --> 01:59:35,503
<i>Dear Mr. Kowalski.</i>

1250
01:59:35,878 --> 01:59:38,339
<i>You are wasted in a canning factory.</i>

1251
01:59:41,592 --> 01:59:44,971
<i>Please take these Occamy eggshells
as collateral for your bakery.</i>

1252
01:59:45,137 --> 01:59:46,597
<i>A well-wisher.</i>

1253
02:00:08,286 --> 02:00:09,412
Well...

1254
02:00:10,288 --> 02:00:12,665
- It's been, um...
- Hasn't it?

1255
02:00:16,794 --> 02:00:18,546
Listen, Newt, uh...

1256
02:00:19,505 --> 02:00:21,048
I wanted to thank you.

1257
02:00:21,632 --> 02:00:23,009
What on earth for?

1258
02:00:24,051 --> 02:00:25,303
Well, you know...

1259
02:00:26,262 --> 02:00:28,657
If you hadn't said all those nice things
to Madam Picquery about me,

1260
02:00:28,681 --> 02:00:31,309
I wouldn't be back
on the investigative team now.

1261
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:36,147
I can't think of anyone
that I'd rather have investigating me.

1262
02:00:39,108 --> 02:00:41,277
Try not to need investigating for a bit.

1263
02:00:41,444 --> 02:00:42,445
I will.

1264
02:00:42,904 --> 02:00:45,281
A quiet life for me from now on.

1265
02:00:45,448 --> 02:00:46,782
Back to the Ministry.

1266
02:00:46,991 --> 02:00:48,409
Deliver my manuscript.

1267
02:00:48,659 --> 02:00:50,161
I'll look out for it.

1268
02:00:50,661 --> 02:00:53,581
<i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.</i>

1269
02:00:59,503 --> 02:01:01,672
Does Leta Lestrange like to read?

1270
02:01:02,924 --> 02:01:04,342
Who?

1271
02:01:05,968 --> 02:01:08,179
The girl whose picture you carry.

1272
02:01:10,681 --> 02:01:13,559
I don't really know
what Leta likes these days.

1273
02:01:14,852 --> 02:01:16,520
- Oh.
- 'Cause people change.

1274
02:01:17,313 --> 02:01:19,273
- Yes.
- I've changed.

1275
02:01:20,983 --> 02:01:22,318
I think. Uh...

1276
02:01:23,361 --> 02:01:24,779
Maybe a little.

1277
02:01:34,747 --> 02:01:36,874
I'll send you a copy of my book, if I may.

1278
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:39,251
I'd like that.

1279
02:01:57,728 --> 02:02:02,650
I'm so sorry. How would you feel
if I gave you your copy in person?

1280
02:02:05,403 --> 02:02:06,737
I'd like that.

1281
02:02:09,949 --> 02:02:11,575
Very much.

1282
02:03:28,694 --> 02:03:31,614
Where'd you get your ideas
from, Mr. Kowalski?

1283
02:03:31,822 --> 02:03:33,491
I don't know. I don't know.

1284
02:03:34,909 --> 02:03:36,535
They just come.

1285
02:03:36,952 --> 02:03:38,954
Here you go. Don't forget this.

1286
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:40,498
Enjoy.

1287
02:03:40,831 --> 02:03:42,541
Hey! Hendry.

1288
02:03:42,708 --> 02:03:45,336
Storage, all right?
Thanks, pal.
