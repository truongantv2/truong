1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:11,490


3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,900


4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,870
Kyoto

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,910
Touzan

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,840
Yajima Residence

7
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,900
Due to the storm wind blast from the slopes of Mount Mimuro,

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,440
maple leaves are falling.

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,720
Make the Tatsuta River look very beautiful.

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,630
The same favorite card with Master huh?

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,880
This is all thanks to you, Ooka Momiji.

12
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,810
I will thank you after the filming.

13
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,450
Is not this too soon? It's coming?

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,480
You apparently!

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,620
What's this? Ti-Not possible!

16
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,730
Now spring has arrived and the flowers begin to bloom.

17
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:17,670
Now spring has arrived and the flowers begin to bloom.

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,640
At the moment it is non-negotiable.

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,770
Wow, his caruta card was thrown so far?

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,280
Ah, no need to bother.

21
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,550
Eh? Yes.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,850
Forgive me.

23
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,990
Sweetness!

24
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,680
Hey, daddy, do not be noisy!

25
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,960
Beautiful sister!

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,100
He's like an idol!

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,140
Kimono is also suitable!

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,530
By the way why are we here and watching the karuta match?

29
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,530
Mikiko already told you, right?

30
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,620
... to wait in the locker room until consultation time arrives...

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,320
... but the uncle is captivated by these beautiful girls, and just goes to the studio.

32
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,770
Mikiko, who is she?

33
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,680
Did not I already introduce it to you?

34
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,860
The opponent of the beautiful cute player, the girl with the glasses!

35
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,750
He is the chairman of the Kaihou Academy Karuta Club, which I am a member of!

36
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,750
Members... Kazuha, can you play karuta?

37
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,490
Iyalah, did you just know?

38
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,390
You went to the bathroom for a long time, Heiji?

39
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,290
Sorry, sorry!

40
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,130
The entrance to the studio is closed, so I'm not sure what it can open.

41
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,990
Excuse me.

42
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,830
We're in the middle of filming, so can you calm down?

43
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:21,970
Good!

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,510
For your precious sake,
Even though my life is full of spirit itself...
I do not care.

45
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,610
Cool!

46
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,310
Hey, Kudo...

47
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,280
... did the uncle forget that he came to Osaka for consultation?

48
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,150
Well, do not be so to him.

49
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,850
He took the kids with him because they kept nagging...

50
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,940
... want to go see Osaka, while Professor Agasa is busy.

51
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,060
By the way what happened to that rich girl?

52
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,160
Oh, Sonoko.

53
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,210
He was lying in bed with a fever.

54
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm still surprised. Kazuha, why did you join Club Karuta?

55
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,790
I'm still joining the Aikido Club really.

56
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,380
Club Karuta was almost disbanded for not having enough members, so I signed up.

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,360
Sometimes I also accompany Mikiko to practice, I'm at a club like a member of a zombie.

58
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,780
Member of zombies? Funny thing!

59
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,690
Fun, it looks like the two of you are having fun...

60
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,500
... it feels like being in a cafe alone.

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,860
Forgive us!

62
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,550
Detective Conan Movie: Love Letter Red

63
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,610
I am a high school detective, Kudo Shinichi!

64
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,380
As I go to the playground with my childhood friend, Mouri Ran...

65
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,450
... I see people dressed in black, doing a suspicious transaction.

66
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,060
Being too focused on seeing their transactions...

67
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,630
... I did not realize there was another member who beat me from behind.

68
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,300
I was forced to take strange medicine by them...

69
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,900
... and when I wake up...

70
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,420
... my body is getting smaller!

71
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,380
If they know Kudo Shinichi is still alive...

72
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,160
... they will look for me and harm the people around me.

73
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,940
At the suggestion of Professor Agasa, I hid my identity. When Ran asks my name...

74
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,480
... spontaneous I answer Edogawa Conan!

75
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,200
To dig deeper information about them, I live with Ran whose father is a private detective.

76
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,660
This is Hattori Heiji.

77
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,640
Detective SMA from the west.

78
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,420
With the great deduction capabilities passed on from the father, the Osaka Police Department Leader...

79
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,020


80
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,800
... he has solved countless difficult cases.

81
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
He is one of the few people who know my true identity.

82
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,700
Toyama Kazuha.

83
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,200
Hattori's childhood classmate and childhood friend.

84
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,620
He is always restless with words spoken by Hattori.

85
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,060
And finally that is still shrouded in mystery, the Queen of the future.

86
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,760
Who is she really?

87
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,840
Even though my body is smaller, my intelligence remains the same.

88
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,120
A famous detective.

89
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,460
Truth there is only one!

90
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,540
Nichiuri TV

91
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,640
Well. We can finally visit the TV studio, but instead were told to wait in the locker room ?!

92
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,500
I want to watch their shoot!

93
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,780
Not possible. They scolded Uncle Kogoro as well.

94
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,530
World Karuta Satsuki-Kai
Tuan Mouri Kogoro

95
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,920
Sorry. It's because I was talking too loud.

96
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,770
Ah, I know!

97
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,780
Let's go to the souvenir shop when the others are back?

98
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,620
Heh ?!

99
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,270
The right one ?!

100
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,290
Yes. If you want to be nice until the shooting is over, okay?

101
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,460
Of course!

102
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,340
Hooray!

103
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,820
Let's go shopping together!

104
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,680
Oh, yeah... Conan went where?

105
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,520
Ah, Conan...

106
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,980
... he is watching my father to replace me.

107
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,580
Hey, boy!

108
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,150
Did not I already tell you to wait in the locker room?

109
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,410
But Kak Ran asks me to keep an eye on my uncle during filming.

110
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:08,980
God.

111
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,230
Please step aside!

112
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,280
Please give way! Karuta wants to pass!

113
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,480
Gosh! Karuta Satsuki-Kai!

114
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,080
Wow! Is that not too much for a caruta?

115
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,000
What are you saying, Kazuha?

116
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,560
It is a legendary karuta that is only used in the final round of national tournaments organized by Satsuki-Kai!

117
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,980
Ah, is not your dream to play using it, Mikiko?

118
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,300
It's not me!

119
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,860
No one in Satsuki-Kai's 20-year history is not captivated by the card.

120
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,820
Aah... I really want to touch that legendary caruta during the final.

121
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,820
Hey, hey, why are those cards used only when the final?

122
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,740
Since it is often used in fierce matches, so it has gone through a lot of damage.

123
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,260
That's why, in addition to the final, the cards remain in the box...

124
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
... and also often exhibited in the museum.

125
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,060
But is not that much keeper still excessive?

126
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,010
Not really!

127
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,780
After last year's Satsuki Cup, there was an unbelievable furor over the loss of his karuta.

128
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Although it can eventually be found quickly, but...

129
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,040
... I heard that Yajima, the defending champion, convinced President Achiwa to tighten his guard.

130
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,220
So yes.

131
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,680
But who are they?

132
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,240
This uncle is stupid or what ?!

133
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,500
These are the people who will consult you!

134
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,860
Oh, really?

135
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,540
That is the uncle we know and we love.

136
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,690
The person in this photo is President Achiwa Kensuke.

137
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,880
He is a great man who founded Achiwa Real Estate.

138
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,960
Also known as the Naniwa Real Estate King.

139
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,040
Why would such a person want to play karuta?

140
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,800
I think it's just his hobby.

141
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,060
But I heard he is also great.

142
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,280
But here it is written that Pak Achiwa wants to be a reader, not a player.

143
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,120
Oh! Who is this beautiful woman?

144
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,420
His wife Mr. Achiwa, Mrs. Satsuki.

145
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,480
Oh! So he's married.

146
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,790
Satsuki-Kai was founded by Mrs. Satsuki, former Queen, and Mr. Achiwa took over and became president.

147
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,630
Queen = Female Karuta Champion

148
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,860
Is there anything else...

149
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,020
Ah! Is not this interesting?

150
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,780
Here it is written that Pak Achiwa believes in superstition...

151
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,000
... and always wash his car the day before his wife will play an important game.

152
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,480
He says if a clean car is his secret to success and win!

153
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,800
And I have to talk to this superstitious couple?

154
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,720
No. Mrs. Satsuki has died of a serious illness 3 years ago.

155
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,180
So only Pak Achiwa will be consulting today.

156
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,740
Be-I see.

157
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,160
Emm, who is the burly person who is always beside Mr. Achiwa in all these photos ?.

158
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,880
Ah, he's a former secretary of Pak Achiwa, his name is Kaieda Togo.

159
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,840
He is the cunning guy who is responsible for the illegal business of Achiwa Real Estate.

160
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,500
He resigned from his position as secretary, and is where he is now...

161
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,220
Wait for Hattori! Stop spreading such unfounded accusations!

162
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,420
There is no illegal business from President Satsuki-Kai!

163
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,580
That's right, Heiji!

164
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,060
Well, yeah. It's just a hoax, hoax.

165
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,520
Welcome the President!

166
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,880
President Achiwa!

167
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,070
I have to welcome him.

168
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,440
Mr. President! Thank you for coming today.

169
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, it's great to be here.

170
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,640
Thank you.

171
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,180
If I'm not mistaken today there is a demonstration of a Yajima match against Momiji, right?

172
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,840
Then there's the consultation.

173
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:26,340
Right! And after that we will show special coverage about Karuta Satsuki-Kai which was recorded last week with the help of Yajima.

174
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,920
So the whole country can see the attraction of this caruta!

175
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,430
Oh, so Karuta Satsuki-Kai has been prepared huh?

176
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,200
All right, I'm counting on you.

177
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,820
Good!

178
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,740
What an impressive man.

179
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,500
Well, that's the King of Real Estate Naniwa.

180
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,880
Excuse me! Can you call Master Yajima?

181
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,400
We will start soon, but...

182
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,360
... we can not reach him.

183
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,000
That's weird...

184
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,280
... he says he'll be here an hour before the filming starts.

185
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,240
Yajima's arrogant man comes too late ?!

186
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,220
Ask Sekine to come here too, just in case.

187
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,800
So we can ask him to replace if something goes wrong.

188
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,710
But that's just a maple leaf, helpless to fly away.

189
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,480
Ti-Not possible.

190
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,500
We have a little time before filming starts.

191
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,420
Right!

192
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,780
Hey, Heiji. We have to buy okonomiyaki.

193
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,480
Heh? Before buying okonomiyaki, there is one place we should go first!

194
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,140
Well, but after that okonomiyaki...

195
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,100
Sorry! Are you okay?

196
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,000
You're the carunt player that was ?!

197
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,460
Fate.

198
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,040
Finally I can meet you.

199
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,940
Eh ?!

200
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,640
My husband's candidate!

201
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,580
Candidate ?!

202
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,540
Husband ?!

203
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,040
Eh ?!

204
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,500
I have no plans after filming, so...

205
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,240
... will you talk to me while you have tea?

206
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,580
Wow... this big sister's chest too!

207
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,700
H-Hey what do you mean ?!

208
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,460
Miss Momiji!

209
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,600
Sorry, but can you come back to the room now!

210
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,120
Ah, why in a fun time like this.

211
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,040
Looks like Mr. Yajima is late, you know?

212
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,400
Yajima?

213
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,140
Well, when he himself planned this event...

214
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,120
... is that what keeps him busy?

215
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,880
Then see you again, Heiji!

216
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,420
Well, see you soon!

217
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,540
Who is that woman ?!

218
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,220
That's the pretty sister who was!

219
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,520
He is very beautiful!

220
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,280
The man called her Miss Momiji.

221
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,600
I told you I do not know who he is!

222
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,860
But he knows your name is Heiji!

223
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,940
Kak Ran.

224
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,770
I will not be angry, let's confess!

225
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,440
We wait for them outside !?

226
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,430
You're already angry!

227
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,820
Instead of seeing them quarrel.

228
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,840
I'm not angry!

229
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,530
Come on, come on!

230
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,600
He's too familiar to someone you do not know!

231
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,060
Why is he so angry?

232
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,300
I-That... maybe I used to meet him somewhere.

233
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,060
Look at my eyes when talking...

234
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,600
... you know him, right ?!

235
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,000
I told you so, I do not know!

236
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,520
Anyway, how could I ever forget such a beautiful woman!

237
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,820
As beautiful as that...?

238
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,980
Iyalah, and here there are people who are unforgettable in a completely different way.

239
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,140
Huh ?!

240
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,880
What do you mean ?!

241
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,040
Hey, hey. Kak Heiji, you really do not know him?

242
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,040
Ooka Momiji?

243
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,820
Satsuki Cup Winner High school level twice in a row.

244
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,940
Class two in Kyoto Senshin High is a strong candidate for the next Queen.

245
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,700
Ooka Momiji?

246
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,720
Queen's Candidate?

247
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,350
Osaka Prefectural Police Station

248
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,420
So that's the only threat?

249
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,470
Yes. Just inscribed "Nichiuri TV will explode".

250
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,040
Then what about this caruta image?

251
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,560
It is attached in the letter.

252
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,540
We still do not know what it means.

253
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,840
So, what does Nichiuri TV know about this?

254
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,940
We already warned them.

255
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,780
How did you respond, Heizo?

256
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,100
This is just a prankster or a real bomb threat?

257
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,280
It is very difficult to specify only by e-mail.

258
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,130
If not a prankster, this is not a matter of carelessness.

259
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,190
We have just received an order from the Osaka Police For an emergency evacuation.

260
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,570
Stop all your work and filming process, then exit through the nearest emergency door.

261
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,230
What announcement is this?

262
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,610
Hm? Are they in an evacuation drill?

263
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:20,530
I repeat: We just received an order from the Osaka Police For an emergency evacuation.

264
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,380
What happened something?

265
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,780
He said from the police.

266
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,860
Maybe this is part of filming ?!

267
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,980
Stop all your work and filming process...

268
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,530
Hey, quickly find out!

269
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,890
... then exit through the nearest emergency door.

270
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,760
Good!

271
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,000
What's happening?

272
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,500
Kazuha, you just come out through the emergency exit! Understand?!

273
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,200
Eh? What about you, Heiji?

274
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,120
I'll find out what's really going on.

275
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,960
You hurry out!

276
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,840
Wait... Heiji!

277
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,480
Be careful!

278
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,920
Hey, boy!

279
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,380
You think you want to go where?

280
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,150
Something's missing in the studio.

281
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,060
Bego!

282
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,780
Did not you hear the announcement ?!

283
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,660
Forgive me. I have no experience in anything like this.

284
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,440
This is my first time doing an evacuation with a kimono.

285
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,910
This is bad! We must evacuate as soon as possible!

286
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,580
Be calm, what's going on?

287
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,800
We... received a bomb threat!

288
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,470
What ?!

289
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,780
President of Achiwa, this may be a false threat...

290
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,500
... but please do evacuation until we are sure it is completely safe.

291
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,800
All right!

292
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,140
Everything! Follow my instructions and get out!

293
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,120
Come on! Hurry up!

294
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,060
Good!

295
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,180
What are you doing, Mikiko?

296
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,560
Harmful if it's still here!

297
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,580
Hurry away!

298
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,040
Mr. Achiwa, you too.

299
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,940
What are you doing ?! Let's go!

300
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,920
Everything! Please keep calm!

301
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,550
Not to worry. Everything is safe.

302
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,870
You guys wait here and do not go anywhere, understand?

303
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,470
What... waiting again?

304
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,120
Can not connect...

305
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,390
... I hope father and the others are fine.

306
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,800
Ran!

307
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,060
Dad! Conan!

308
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,240
Woi, what really happened ?!

309
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,820
Could this be an evacuation drill without prior warning?

310
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,380
No, I asked his TV employee, and he said...

311
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,040
... this building got a bomb threat!

312
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,920
Really ?!

313
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,180
Eh, then Kazuha and Hattori are there ?!

314
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,140
What?

315
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,150
Are not they with you guys?

316
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,220
No... I'm so worried, let me look for a while.

317
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,400
Do not! I'm the one looking.

318
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,520
You stay here!

319
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,560
You guys too!

320
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,020
God.

321
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,340
Emergency during peak hours like this.

322
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,040
Heiji!

323
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,310
Mikiko!

324
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,410
I told you to go out first!

325
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,240
Yeah, but I'm worried about you.

326
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,960
Sorry ya Kazuha. I can not leave that caruta here.

327
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,700
I will track the GPS signal from the phone.

328
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,300
What? Hattori is still inside ?!

329
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,090
You're there...

330
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,860
... what are you doing ?!

331
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,420
Leave it here and hurry out!

332
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,320
God.

333
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,640
Mikiko!

334
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,660
Kazuha! Hattori!

335
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,340
Do you know we are in danger ?!

336
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,310
I'm sorry!

337
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,420
I'm sorry!

338
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,040
Geez.

339
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,100
Permission to report, there are still three people in Studio 3.

340
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,740
Mikiko!

341
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,700
You are so clumsy.

342
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,640
I'm sorry.

343
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,200
I'm worried about this when I imagine if the bomb threat is really going to happen.

344
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,170
We can not confirm when the bomb will explode.

345
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,960
We will wait for the next command.

346
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,100
I'm counting on you.

347
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,400
We've evacuated three people still in the studio.

348
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,960
Make sure everything is safe!

349
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,520
Good.

350
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,880
Great. Now it's time we look for something that looks suspicious.

351
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,500
All troops, start combing all the inside of the building!

352
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,460
Ready to execute!

353
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,900
They entered.

354
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,160
Is there really a bomb?

355
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm sure this is a prankster.

356
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,570
Quickly! Through this way!

357
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,660
What ?!

358
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,350
Everything is moving!

359
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,600
Tell everyone to back off!

360
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,260
Get away from the building!

361
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,440
Mr. President, please be faster.

362
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,260
Beware!

363
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,320
Kazuha!

364
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,560
Cool!

365
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,000
Do not come near! Too dangerous!

366
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,520
Shit! Where the hell are they both ?!

367
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,560
You're not stuck in there right, Hattori ?!

368
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,570
Kazuha!

369
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,240
We do not keep quiet. It's dangerous here. Let's go!

370
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,220
Are you okay? Can you still walk?

371
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,240
M-Still.

372
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,900
Good, let's get out of here!

373
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,080
With this kind of situation it's too hard to get inside.

374
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,820
Yes.

375
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,160
Everything away from the building!

376
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,360
Someone just came out of there ?!

377
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,430
Is there anything else?

378
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,350
There are still two more people inside!

379
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,220
What ?!

380
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,720
Kazuha, over here!

381
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,200
Shit!

382
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,580
Heiji!

383
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,340
Nearly.

384
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,320
Quick, fast! Get away from here!

385
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,980
We can not go down ya ?!

386
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,500
Kazuha, here!

387
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,300
We go up to the roof!

388
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,520
What?

389
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,040
Is not we supposed to get out?

390
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,520
If we can not get out, at least we should find a place to be able to breathe.

391
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,830
Could it be, Hattori?

392
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,040
He's up ?!

393
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,120
Shit! Can not be connected.

394
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Come on, Kazuha!

395
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,680
Kazuha!

396
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,520
Be careful!

397
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,440
Is not this roof made of concrete ?!

398
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,500
Closer! We need to get closer!

399
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,210
Impossible! Dangerous if too close!

400
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,850
Excuse me! Please give way!

401
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,310
Shit!

402
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,250
I can not see anything because of this smoke.

403
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,140
I can not do it myself... can not if it's on my own.

404
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,010
Kudo!

405
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,470
Sink or swim?

406
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,610
I'll try!

407
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,440
Ayoo !!

408
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,210
What's that...?

409
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,700
Finally he comes!

410
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,150
Hattori.

411
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,680
Hey, Heiji, where are we going?

412
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,720
Come on! There is only one path down.

413
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,600
Go down ?! What do you mean?

414
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,200
Stay here Kazuha! Understand?

415
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,980
Heiji ?!

416
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,320
Get off from here?

417
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,360
Are you kidding right ?!

418
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,180
Hey! We're ready!

419
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,360
Me too.

420
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,120
There is no time, I will drop you both at once.

421
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,720
All right!

422
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,680
Kazuha!

423
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,800
Do we really want to get off the top of the...

424
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,760
Wait! At this point I can not see!

425
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,380
Not possible. You're not serious right, Heiji ?!

426
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,160
Close your eyes and tight grip!

427
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,170
Eh ?! T-Tu-Wait!

428
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,410
Wait a minute!

429
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,910
Thanks! I wait for you downstairs!

430
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,560
Well.

431
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,930
Kudo!

432
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,920
Shit!

433
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,660
Kudo!

434
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,710
Not possible. Somebody's over there, let's get over there quick!

435
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,750
Let me get there!

436
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,840
There really are people! Stretcher! Bring a stretcher!

437
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:36,890
Kazuha!

438
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:38,850
He-Heiji!

439
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,740
Shit!

440
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,980
Only from this place can I go down.

441
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,280
Thinking... there must be another way out!

442
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,800
Rescue helicopter?

443
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,000
No, impossible.

444
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,780
With fire and smoke this thick as helicopters can not get close.

445
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,280
Wait!

446
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,620
Is not there a river next to the TV studio ?!

447
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,560
If I jump over there.

448
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,920
All right!

449
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,220
Ah no!

450
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,900
There is not enough ground to accelerate my skateboard rate.

451
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Emergency!

452
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,320
I just took a short breath but my lungs burned.

453
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,320
I have to... do... something.

454
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,900
Ran!

455
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,680
I can not... give up.

456
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,630
There must be something to use for a skateboarding... somewhere.

457
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,640
There!

458
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,900
What are you doing, Kudo? Hurry up!

459
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,460
That's right ?!

460
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,270
No doubt, it's Kudo. But what is he...

461
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,380
So yes!

462
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,860
So that's it!

463
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,660
More...

464
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,880
... even faster!

465
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,780
I can not breathe.

466
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,300
A little more, just a little more!

467
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,280
It will fall!

468
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,860
This is it!

469
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,340
Shit!

470
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,830
Is it still not fast enough ?!

471
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,920
Emergency! Will not be up!

472
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
You made me wait!

473
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,260
I caught you!

474
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,140
You're okay, Kudo?

475
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,840
Well...

476
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,320
... I guess so.

477
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,110
You dropped this.

478
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,060
Thank you.

479
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,260
Anyway, you bring that thing huh?

480
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,030
Did you know that Nichiuri TV will explode?

481
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,780
Stupid.

482
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,340
Of course not!

483
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,980
I'm just in case something happens.

484
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,860
Something like this huh?

485
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,060
Hmm. That's it.

486
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,320
Kazuha!

487
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,440
Ran!

488
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,880
Are you okay?

489
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,220
Yeah, but I can not remember how to survive...

490
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,380
... because it is so hard to breathe, too much smoke.

491
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,280
It's okay, it's important you survived.

492
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,200
Thank goodness! I'm glad you survived.

493
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,360
Ran.

494
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,880
It looks like my car keys are missing, I'm going to go find it.

495
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,540
Okay.

496
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,640
Oh yes, where is Conan?

497
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,000
I think he went to the point of gathering as well.

498
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,420
Ah, Conan!

499
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,080
That's right Conan!

500
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,150
Conan! Where have you been?

501
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,600
We are very worried.

502
00:25:59,300 --> 00:25:59,950
K-Kazuha!

503
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,600
Wait, Heiji!

504
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,320
Where have you been?

505
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,060
E-Eh... anu.

506
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,420
You are also Conan!

507
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,960
I'm very very worried about you.

508
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,360
I'm sorry.

509
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,850
What about Mikiko?

510
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,250
It looks like his hand was injured, so he was immediately rushed to the hospital.

511
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,490
His hand?

512
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,850
I hope it is not bad.

513
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,780
I know the address of the hospital, what if we go together?

514
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,080
Yes! Let's go!

515
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,960
Heiji!

516
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,340
Uncle Otaki!

517
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,820
Thank goodness you survived.

518
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,520
Kazuha, do you seem to go first?

519
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,310
Eeh ?!

520
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,420
Later I'll catch up soon.

521
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,180
Aduuh. Let's go, Ran!

522
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,840
Y-Well. Ah yes, Conan come on!

523
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,120
Y-Well.

524
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,060
You can not go anywhere without me!

525
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,020
Good.

526
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,720
See you later, Conan.

527
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,860
Is it true that the Police Department received a bomb threat?

528
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,690
This is the letter that the police received.

529
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,410
Ah! There's a karuta card too?

530
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,880
Maybe this is related to the filming of their caruta program.

531
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,780
But with Nichiuri TV conditions like this.

532
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,440
It will take a lot of time to do the crime scene.

533
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,780
Right.

534
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,770
In the corners of the mountains, stepping on the red leaves, came the sound of the stag dance that ran. When I heard the cry of loneliness, sad, how sad this autumn.

535
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,160
What do the perpetrators want?

536
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,980
Naniwa Police Hospital

537
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,960
Thanks for the help.

538
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,420
Equally. Get well soon!

539
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,680
Mr. President, how are you doing?

540
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,920
Ah, not too bad. Just scratch a little.

541
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,040
Thank goodness.

542
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,680
With this incident the competition will...

543
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,000
Well... this is very unexpected.

544
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,340
Looks like I have to stop the Satsuki Cup that has been going on for years.

545
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,680
Do not stop!

546
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,930
I think now is the right time to show how exciting Satsuki-Kai is!

547
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:50,080
But Satsuki-Kai's karuta to be used for the final is on fire.

548
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,460
If that's you do not have to worry.

549
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,780
His caruta survived.

550
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,270
A-What ?!

551
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,220
A-What...

552
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,600
... m-you mean?

553
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,100
Miss Hiramoto stuck it out during the evacuation process.

554
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,640
Mi-Mikiko ?!

555
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,560
If his karuta is burned I can understand, but his karuta is safe, so...

556
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,460
Really ?!

557
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,900
Is it true that Satsuki-Kai karuta was saved ?!

558
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,980
Pe-The museum officer who took it and is being examined.

559
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:14,990
Mr. President.

560
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,940
The caruta is fine.

561
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,340
So you do not have to worry.

562
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,460
Well.

563
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,060
I think it will burn, thank goodness if survived.

564
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,420
Then, how is the circumstance of Mikiko who has saved Satsuki-Kai karuta?

565
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,540
It looks like the injury was not so bad, but...

566
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,000
He's still under investigation.

567
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,700
So yes.

568
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,860
Mikiko long time huh?

569
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,340
Doctors say Mikiko just need first aid...

570
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,600
Thank you very much.

571
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,680
Mikiko, your hand why? Is it possible...?

572
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,740
Yes. My hand is broken.

573
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,880
This may be my law...

574
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,740
Not possible.

575
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:55,140
... for putting Kazuha and Hattori in danger to take back his cards.

576
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,450
What are you saying?

577
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,170
I am indebted to you, Mikiko!

578
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,590
You saved the karuta that has become a symbol of Satsuki-Kai.

579
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,430
Representing the association, I thank you very much for what you have done.

580
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,790
But Mr. President...

581
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,290
... I can not participate in Satsuki Cup with conditions like this.

582
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:18,220
Well. This is a big loss for Satsuki-Kai because talented players like you can not participate.

583
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,570
But for now you better focus on your healing.

584
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,100
Right.

585
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,320
There is still competition again next year.

586
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,760
Still this is not a good thing!

587
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,370
If we can not get a good result in this year's Satsuki Cup...

588
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,610
... our club will be dissolved.

589
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,010
I do not want his club to break up because I'm injured.

590
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,380
Mr. President.

591
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,820
The police are waiting for you.

592
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,880
We have to go.

593
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,620
Well.

594
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,330
Do not be sad Mikiko.

595
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,670
But.

596
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,820
Well. Only the two of us here are members of our club.

597
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,420
There it is, Kazuha!

598
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,480
Please participate.

599
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,990
To represent the Kaihou Academy, play in my place!

600
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,170
You suddenly said that to me.

601
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,560
Kazuha, did you ever participate in the tournament?

602
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,570
No, no.

603
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,280
But you often help me practice, right?

604
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,000
Well.

605
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,940
Kazuha, you have great strength, quick reflexes and competing spirit.

606
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,000
You're also never afraid to compete.

607
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,800
Your courage is amazing!

608
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,540
This seems too much.

609
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,840
When will the tournament begin?

610
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,300
Will start day after tomorrow.

611
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,740
Not to worry.

612
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,420
If we start training now...

613
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,980
... you can do it, I'm sure of it!

614
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,190
A beginner wants to participate in the tournament and hopes to win?

615
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:37,050
Are you sure you will replace Hyakunin Isshu with Iroha-garuta?

616
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:38,050
Hyakunin Isshu is an anthology of classical Japanese poetry, used in Uta-garuta. Iroha-garuta is a variation of Uta-garuta that is more easily understood.

617
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,680
Do not taunt him!

618
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,760
I know his talent is more than anyone because I'm the one who's been practicing with him.

619
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,680
He may not have experience in the tournament...

620
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,920
... but its ability is equivalent to player class A.

621
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,920
Heh?

622
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,900
This girl?

623
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,400
Are not you the one with Heiji?

624
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,730
I wonder what relationship you two have?

625
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,900
We've always been together since childhood! Heiji is...

626
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,730
Is...

627
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,330
Your beloved right ?!

628
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,380
No need to cover up!

629
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,480
That's clear!

630
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,960
Silence you guys!

631
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,440
"Shinoburedo" huh?

632
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,580
The first line in Hyakunin Isshu's fortieth poem, "Though I hid it."

633
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,980
Playing a role as a childhood lover.

634
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,920
Adorable once.

635
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,810
How about this ?!

636
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,970
Who can win the tournament tomorrow will be his future wife Heiji...

637
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,580
... and express love to him!

638
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,090
What do you think?

639
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,640
Wait, what do you mean ?!

640
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,360
If you're serious with Heiji, at least you have the courage to do it, right?

641
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,920
Kazuha, do not be hooked by him!

642
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,500
But as long as you know ya...

643
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,730
... I am very serious.

644
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:46,850
Wait a minute!

645
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,620
I will accept...

646
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,050
... your challenge!

647
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,170
Ka-Kazuha!

648
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,120
Really!

649
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,940
Your spirit is...

650
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,580
... save it for the game later.

651
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,410
Yes, you too. Do not lose before meeting me!

652
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,010
Then, let's get here.

653
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,820
I will go to the nail salon in preparation to proclaim my love for Heiji.

654
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,070
The sister looks horrible.

655
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,430
There must be something.

656
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,980
You're so cool...

657
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,460
... can say that to Momiji!

658
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,520
What have I done?

659
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,100
Eh ?!

660
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,030
I've promised something bad.

661
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,040
I'm sorry.

662
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,310
No, it's my fault.

663
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,690
Dad! What's the key?

664
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,460
Well, how about it?

665
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,360
The key is not met...

666
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,230
... when I've been looking for it everywhere.

667
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,000
Maybe I should take the spare key.

668
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,030
What is it, Conan?

669
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,280
Looks like the sister had dropped it.

670
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,640
Eh? Try to show me ?!

671
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,110
Right, this is Momiji's.

672
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,230
Dad, I'll give it back for a bit.

673
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,350
Hey, do you know him?

674
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,940
I'm so confused.

675
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,550
What should I do ?!

676
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,110
How is it?

677
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,130
Even though she looks horrible...

678
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,770
But she is beautiful!

679
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,980
If such beautiful woman declares her love for Kak Heiji, she surely will not refuse...

680
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,440
... ta-but of course Kak Kazuha that he will choose.

681
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,260
Really ?!

682
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,700
Right, right!

683
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,140
No time to think about it.

684
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,160
Starting tonight I will practice all night!

685
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,500
This is my first time to the hospital.

686
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,890
This place is huge... I can get lost here.

687
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,400
Kak Ran, he's there!

688
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:28,890
That.

689
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,980
Momiji!

690
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,750
Wait a minute!

691
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,570
Momiji! Wait!

692
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,460
He's gone.

693
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,720
How should this be?

694
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,890
We already know the full name and the school...

695
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,350
... but is not it easier if we find the address there?

696
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,050
You're right.

697
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,150
Kak Ran, I also want to see.

698
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,130
Oh, okay.

699
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,700
Emm... this...

700
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,600
... a photo.

701
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,200
Who is this guy ?!

702
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,700
Oh, there are others.

703
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,550
Looks like this is a childhood picture.

704
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,520
This is Momiji and...

705
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,600
... Hattori, right ?!

706
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,150
They make the promise of the little finger.

707
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,770
I'm curious about what promises.

708
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,890
Maybe their promise will be married?

709
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,890
They are still kids ?!

710
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,580
That's not possible.

711
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,890
No. This situation is very Heiji.

712
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,140
That's very possible.

713
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,630
Ah! That's Kak Heiji's bike!

714
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,180
Keep it a secret, okay?

715
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,840
Especially from Kazuha.

716
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,560
You two are waiting for me huh?

717
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,500
No, no.

718
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,940
What's up with him?

719
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,640
Ran! What have you returned?

720
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,000
I-yes.

721
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,120
You're so old?

722
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,840
So what information you got?

723
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,440
Nothing. Osaka prefectural police also still experience chaos.

724
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,380
Uncle Otaki will call me if there is more information.

725
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,040
Mr. President.

726
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,040
Sorry to bother you...

727
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,060
... can you answer the phone?

728
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,820
Yes, no problem.

729
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,780
God.

730
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,500
... what's wrong with Ran?

731
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,120
From the Kyoto Prefectural Police ?!

732
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,300
Yes.

733
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,180
So what happened to Yajima?

734
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,450
What ?!

735
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,350
Killed ?!

736
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,150
Hattori!

737
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,450
Yes.

738
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,620
Woi! You two, wait!

739
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,060
Thanks for the help.

740
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,940
Wait, you two!

741
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,800
This is a restricted area!

742
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,930
We came with Mr. Mouri Kogoro.

743
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,510
What are you talking about...

744
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,110
You can let them in.

745
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,180
Long time no see ya, you two ?!

746
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,120
Inspector Ayanokoji!

747
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,210
The victim is Yajima Toshiya.

748
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:58,210
He is the son of a highly respected sake businessman family, he lives alone in this house.

749
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:04,550
The time of his death is estimated at 06:00. The body of the victim was found at 14:00.

750
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,350
Ah, watch your step.

751
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,320
This place is very messy.

752
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,690
B-Okay.

753
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,150
Robbery ?!

754
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:16,110
Viewed from the scene at the scene is very clear this is a robbery case.

755
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,990
Right, we also assume that way.

756
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,410
Somebody broke into this house, looking for money and other valuable objects...

757
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,330
... but Yajima caught him.

758
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,590
When the perpetrator immediately killed him with a Japanese sword that he tried to steal.

759
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,060
Next the perpetrator takes the money and runs off.

760
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,940
But why? Why?

761
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,230
It seems that the victim was playing karuta.

762
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,430
It looks so.

763
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,620
What are you two doing here ?!

764
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,900
Mr. Inspector...

765
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,140
... do you allow us both to do crime scene for a while?

766
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,140
The forensics team has done its job, so go ahead.

767
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,920
Really gapapa ?!

768
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,060
But...

769
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,220
... we will seize this katana as evidence of murder.

770
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,620
Ah, that's okay.

771
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,320
Let these people do the crime scene as they see fit.

772
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:00,880
Good.

773
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,280
Then I will wait outside.

774
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,580
Tell us if you find anything.

775
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,080
Well.

776
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,560
What do you think?

777
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,720
I'm not so sure...

778
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
but look at his right hand.

779
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:14,680
Well.

780
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,350
You're aware of it too, Kudo ?!

781
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,660
Well, it looks like he was holding something with his blood.

782
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,420
By the way something is blood, in this room...

783
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,990
... only caruta cards.

784
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,660
The perpetrator must be aware of the death message of the victim...

785
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,970
... then mix it with another blood card of the other caruta.

786
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,440
Finding scattered cards is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

787
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,700
Just leave it to me.

788
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,840
I know someone who is great at analyzing things like this.

789
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,760
What?

790
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,710
Viewed from the former blood stain, this remot was located near the side of the victim's body.

791
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,270
Excuse me.

792
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,720
Can I turn on the TV?

793
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,790
Yes, okay.

794
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,490
Thank you.

795
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,620
If he uses the remot just before being killed, there must be something here.

796
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,300
Ooka Momiji.

797
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,980
So before being killed...

798
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,200
... Yajima watching this?

799
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,820
What's up?

800
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,770
Looks like this is a competition the previous year.

801
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:08,740
Well.

802
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,560
Satsuki Cup tournament between 15th to 20th SMA.

803
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,600
Why is Yajima watching this?

804
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,680
The final capability level is likely to be very high.

805
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,840
So all kinds of tactics and strategy of arranging the cards there...

806
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,660
... can be used as a reference.

807
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,630
I doubt it has anything to do with this murder case.

808
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,020
T-But.

809
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,080
No buts!

810
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,720
Let's go! You too!

811
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,160
Play the detectives until here.

812
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,760
Sorry to have made a scene.

813
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,500
I-yes.

814
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,960
Let go of me!

815
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,660
Latest news.

816
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,520
The explosion occurred at Nichiuri TV.

817
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,010
The news again?

818
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,820
Today around 1 pm...

819
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,720
I'm so worried.

820
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,680
Ai, why did you turn off the TV?

821
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,920
If you feel worried every time you see the news...

822
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,320
... your health will be disturbed.

823
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,400
But.

824
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
You contacted the children right?

825
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,140
But Shinichi has not called back.

826
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,510
This...

827
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,040
Edogawa Conan

828
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,040
... long life apparently.

829
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,150
Oh! Let me talk to him after you're done.

830
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:16,980
Okay.

831
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,820
You are...

832
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,600
... what do you think by not contacting us?

833
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,780
Professor is very worried about you.

834
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,080
My fault, my fault.

835
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,940
A lot happens.

836
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,800
Then why are you calling?

837
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,900
I just sent a photo to your laptop.

838
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,050
I want you to check the karuta that is in the photo.

839
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,240
I thought you were involved in a bombing case, but you sent me a photo of bloody carcass cards ?!

840
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,350
I want you to find a card that was held by the victim.

841
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,360
You're very reliable in this sort of thing right?

842
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,000
This kind of huh?

843
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,420
Ah! There's a picture of someone also here.

844
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,280
Ah, can you also find information about the man in the photo?

845
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,260
This man also has something to do with karuta?

846
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,400
Yeah, I'm suspicious of that.

847
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,300
I will try, but it will take a while.

848
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,120
Thanks! I'm counting on you!

849
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:06,840
See you later!

850
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,520
W-Wait! Professor wants...

851
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,560
Evil.

852
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,060
If this is the case, the likelihood of the target is the members of Satsuki-Kai.

853
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,740
Well.

854
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,540
We'd better pay more attention to those two guys.

855
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,340
I will keep an eye on Mr. Achiwa.

856
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,970
If she's not mistaken she's staying at the same hotel as us.

857
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,730
Then I will handle Ooka Momiji.

858
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,260
Wait, wait! Who are you?!

859
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,760
I'm from Satsuki-Kai, let me by!

860
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,500
Wait a minute, I'll ask for confirmation.

861
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,800
Sekine!

862
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,920
Where have you been ?!

863
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,080
We called you many times, you know ?!

864
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,560
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

865
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,300
I drank too much last night.

866
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,100
To the point of falling asleep and not realizing that my phone runs out of battery.

867
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,580
Geez.

868
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:53,360
When I woke up I was told that there was an explosion in the TV studio.

869
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,860
Then I called the association and they told me that Mr. President was in Yajima place and was looking for me...

870
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,430
... so I hurried here. But it looks like there's been a mess here.

871
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,730
A lot of cops here, what happened to Yajima?

872
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,690
Yajima has...

873
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,610
... killed.

874
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:08,890
Eh ?!

875
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,600
Looks like the robber who has killed him...

876
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,710
... with the katana in the corridor.

877
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:14,710
With katana?

878
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,800
Not possible.

879
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,220
Pak Achiwa, who is this man?

880
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,470
Ah, I'm sorry. I am a cameraman and also a member of Satsuki-Kai.

881
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,170
My name is Sekine Koji.

882
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,090
Sekine is his rival Yajima.

883
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:31,410
The Satsuki Cup final of the last two years is theirs.

884
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,560
Well, but both I lost.

885
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,260
I think that this year I... will win.

886
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,570
But now I can not compete against it anymore.

887
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,430
Are you going to keep performing the tournament as planned?

888
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,430
Ah, about that...

889
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,070
... I just thought about it.

890
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,720
You have to do it, President!

891
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,190
If the Satsuki Cup that has become this tradition fails only because of the death of Yajima...

892
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,410
... maybe his soul will not even calm down.

893
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,140
It is hopeless he was beaten to death.

894
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,160
Sekine! Be careful when talking!

895
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,020
Well.

896
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,110
Forgive me.

897
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,530
I'm from Kyoto Prefectural Police.

898
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,350
There is something I want to ask you, can you ask for a moment?

899
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,980
Ah, of course. Please ask any questions.

900
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,250
Please follow me.

901
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,040
Good, good.

902
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:17,280
Mr. Mouri, we should both go back to Osaka.

903
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,670
Hey, Kudo...

904
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,010
... I seem to know who did it.

905
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,380
Yes, no problem.

906
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,500
Me too.

907
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,680
Please yes!

908
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,370
It seems that the one who killed Yajima is that person.

909
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:29,150
But it's too soon to accuse him of being a TV studio bomber targeting Satsuki-Kai members.

910
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:29,930
Right.

911
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,090
I think keeping an eye on Mr. Achiwa and Momiji is the right move right now, as we have set out.

912
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,000
Yes.

913
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,790
Hotel New Otani

914
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,270
Pertamax.

915
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,230
Bothx.

916
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,800
That's not fair! Wait!

917
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,060
Wow, the room is very spacious!

918
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,120
Sonoko who hired him for us.

919
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,400
He really hopes to come here you know.

920
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:58,020
That's why he rented a hotel close to Nichiuri TV.

921
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,220
As expected from the owner of Suzuki Group.

922
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,390
Well, right.

923
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,780
They will practice all night, so please provide evening snacks as well for them.

924
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,730
Well, thanks.

925
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,000
Geez, why am I doing this?

926
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,460
When I see you, support your friend with passion...

927
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,500
All right!

928
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,080
Okay! Time to practice!

929
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,860
We will help.

930
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,560
If there is anything we can do please just say it!

931
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,380
We will support you!

932
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,210
You guys.

933
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,160
Really ?! Thanks.

934
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,130
There is a phone.

935
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,580
Who is it?

936
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,750
Professor!

937
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,220
Ayumi also wants to talk!

938
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,640
Let's all talk to the professor!

939
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,960
Yes, let's do it.

940
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,320
We ask to practice earnestly.

941
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,240
We will call over there, so it will not interfere.

942
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,240
"Will the spirit support" he said.

943
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,690
That's it.

944
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,450
Well, I can see you guys!

945
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,020
No more events after that right?

946
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:56,700
Yes!

947
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:57,660
We're fine!

948
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,210
We are at the hotel now!

949
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,170
So yes, the time is right!

950
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,240
Eh ?! Is it possible?!

951
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,700
Ta-daa! The long-awaited...

952
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,940
... Professor Quiz Corner!

953
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,650
So that's why Professor called us...?

954
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,480
Let's get started!

955
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:18,120
They say that the unique style of competitive karuta game has similarities to the ancient Japanese tradition...

956
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,020
... which is it?

957
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:27,130
Number one: Picking tea.

958
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:27,150
Number two: Fly a kite.

959
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,170
Number three: Mashing the mochi.

960
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,130
Number four: Harvest rice.

961
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,410
The verb "taking cards" is "tsumu".
"Picking tea" is "chatsumi".

962
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,410
When playing karuta you take the card right? Maybe the answer is picking tea?

963
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,630
Maybe fly a kite? I want to eat takoyaki.

964
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,630
"Fly a kite" in Japanese "Takoage".

965
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,070
There is a phrase when you touch the wrong card right, maybe the answer is pounding mochi.

966
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,070
"Touching the wrong card" is "otetsuki".
"Mashing mochi" is "mochitsuki".

967
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,060
That's your final answer?

968
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,010
The answer is number four, harvesting rice.

969
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:41,720
Ai!

970
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,030
"Ine" means "Rice".

971
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,270
Rice can become rice field...

972
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,030
"Tanbo" means "Rice Field".

973
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,870
... so it means you are harvesting rice in the fields.

974
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,070
"Harvesting" means "Karu".

975
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,670
That's "karuta"!

976
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,090
How can you live without such mercy?

977
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,390
All of you are...

978
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,170
... do not stay up late, despite being on vacation!

979
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,460
Okee!

980
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,960
Yes, the phone is closed.

981
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,330
Good!

982
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,620
Is not it late?

983
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,130
Many things happen today.

984
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,370
Dad and the others have not come home yet.

985
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,670
Ah, Heiji too. Are they still together?

986
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,410
If you're worried about why you did not call him?

987
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,480
B-Right.

988
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,210
What's wrong Kazuha?

989
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,100
Do not ask what's wrong! What are you doing this late ?!

990
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,820
Eh ?! Kyoto?

991
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,090
What's happening?

992
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,300
Sorry, I have a little business here. Maybe it'll be till night, you do not have to wait for me.

993
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,230
What ?! I thought you would help me practice karuta for the tournament.

994
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:34,880
Exercise?

995
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:38,870
I'm participating in a karuta tournament instead of Mikiko.

996
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,370
You've never had experience in tournaments?

997
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,930
That's why I practice!

998
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,530
You're a kid when you play karuta and you're so great Heiji!

999
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,280
Ah, right.

1000
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:53,330
When I was in elementary school I joined in the tournament.

1001
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,230
I'm very surprised how can you win Heiji ?!

1002
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,010
It's been a long time ago, I do not really remember.

1003
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,850
I still remember it clearly.

1004
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,950
When Mikiko asked me to join the club...

1005
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,290
... the memory suddenly flashed through my mind.

1006
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,170
So we're just going to talk about the memories of the past?

1007
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,610
I shut down the phone?

1008
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,470
How much do you say that to me?

1009
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,630
You want to end our conversation while I'm on story?

1010
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,730
I did not mean that.

1011
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,290
Yes, yes. Whatever you say, Heiji!

1012
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,160
Huh? What is my fault?

1013
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,320
Enough! Heiji, you stupid!

1014
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,090
God, what's up with Heiji ?!

1015
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,640
God, what's up with him.

1016
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,630
Well... whatever.

1017
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,010
Ah, it's me. I want you to do something for me.

1018
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,370
Ooka

1019
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,570
Yes, fine. thanks.

1020
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,790
Oh, I'm tired.

1021
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,350
Welcome Uncle.

1022
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,450
Well. Who would have thought I was all the way to Osaka instead involved an incident.

1023
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,640
Eh? Dad, Conan where?

1024
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,910
We gave him a ride because he wants to come back with us.

1025
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,580
But when he got to the hotel he said he wanted to talk to Mr. Achiwa.

1026
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:10,650
Eh ?!

1027
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,590
Gosh, basic Conan.

1028
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,850
If that person is the true culprit...

1029
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,530
... it looks like he did not make Mr. Achiwa his target tonight.

1030
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,610
What is Kak Ran?

1031
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,200
Are you done with your business?

1032
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,230
I-yes.

1033
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,320
Then hurry back to the room!

1034
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,560
After the incident I became easily worried.

1035
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,760
All right. I will be right back.

1036
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,500
Good...

1037
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,680
... I can track her where she goes whenever she goes.

1038
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,560
Oh! Is not he...

1039
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,920
What is he doing here?

1040
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,750
Gosh! Brother is so cool!

1041
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:05,050
Looks like I'm not the right person to train a match with you.

1042
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,540
Hey! Is not this excessive ?! I almost...

1043
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,120
I'm back.

1044
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,050
Ah, Conan!

1045
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,790
I am with someone who can help your practice.

1046
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,470
Eh ?!

1047
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:15,610
Who is he?

1048
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,110
Eh ?! His mother Heiji!

1049
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:21,270
I've heard everything from Heiji.

1050
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:23,180
So I hurried here.

1051
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,610
Eh? Why?

1052
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,040
Of course to help you Kazuha.

1053
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,090
Are not we going to practice karuta?

1054
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:33,790
Yeah, but.

1055
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,780
Let me be your opponent.

1056
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,540
Maybe as a former Queen my ability is not so great.

1057
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:40,970
Former Queen ?!

1058
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,280
I'm here because Heiji is asking me.

1059
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,960
I will teach you everything I know.

1060
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,100
But we do not have enough time...

1061
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,320
... so the exercise will be a little difficult.

1062
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,300
Are you ready?

1063
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:55,790
Good.

1064
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,220
Please help.

1065
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,980
I did not think you would come here...

1066
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,800
... Inspector Ayanokoji.

1067
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:10,960
It seems we are thinking the same thing?

1068
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:11,780
Well.

1069
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,920
Are the detective boys not here?

1070
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,340
He is watching Mr. Achiwa.

1071
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:18,320
So yes.

1072
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,620
Good cooperation.

1073
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:23,890
But I kind of regret choosing here.

1074
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,110
I did not think he lived in a house of this size.

1075
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,820
Thank you for your hard work.

1076
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:39,670
Well.

1077
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,850
I'm the maid of Miss Young Momiji.

1078
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:44,490
My name is Iori.

1079
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,770
Do you guys want to rest for a while over tea?

1080
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,070
He's worried about me.

1081
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,310
My potential husband.

1082
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,610
Although continuously exposed to water, the color will not fade.

1083
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:14,970
Emergency!

1084
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,690
Looks like he has not left the hotel yet.

1085
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:23,650
Waves collected on the beach at Sumi Bay. And in the night collected...

1086
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,470
You've tried very hard.

1087
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:25,940
I honestly did not think you could get this far.

1088
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,100
Let's take a break?

1089
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,120
No! I can still continue.

1090
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,460
Rest is also part of the exercise.

1091
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,500
I will buy porridge for us.

1092
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:39,870
Ah, Kazuha!

1093
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:45,850
Are you okay ?!

1094
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,540
Let him sleep.

1095
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:51,560
He has fought hard without sleeping at all.

1096
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,620
How is Kazuha doing?

1097
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,980
He is more than I think.

1098
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,720
But to get to the last four round it will be difficult.

1099
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,250
To be honest all the games will be hard for him.

1100
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:01,940
But.

1101
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,550
I have not finished up there yet.

1102
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:09,520
I'm saying it's hard...

1103
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,190
... not impossible.

1104
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,790
In karuta tournaments, mental steadiness and the ability to maintain focus are the key.

1105
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,430
This girl has both.

1106
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,150
If he can stay calm and not let his feelings mislead him...

1107
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:23,060
... he has hope of winning.

1108
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,600
If I show this to him...

1109
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,140
... Kazuha must have lost his concentration.

1110
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,520
It will not be long.

1111
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:35,440
Sit quietly.

1112
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,650
God, I have to hurry away, you know ?!

1113
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,910
So what do you want?

1114
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,330
This is about the Yajima murder case.

1115
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,200
Is not the robber doing it?

1116
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,540
Really?

1117
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:53,080
But I can conclude that this is a premeditated murder by a cold-blooded killer.

1118
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:56,840
Are you kidding right? Well, Yajima is not my best friend...

1119
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:00,220
... but I doubt there are people who really hate him and bear to kill his life.

1120
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,180
What about you?

1121
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,090
Nonsense!

1122
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,470
Why me ?!

1123
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,140
Sekine!

1124
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,020
You lost the Satsuki Cup final two years in a row right?

1125
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,060
And all that defeat you got from Yajima.

1126
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,810
If only Yajima does not exist... you must be...

1127
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:16,480
What's all this about!

1128
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,360
Of course I want to win the tournament.

1129
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,360
But not by killing my rival anyway!

1130
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:25,740
Is not the police have made sure that the perpetrators are robbers? Why do not you?

1131
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,740
The reason is a lot.

1132
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,960
First, the place was like a deliberately made messed-up so it looks like there has been a robbery.

1133
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:36,540
You know? The culprit did not touch anything related to karuta.

1134
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:40,720
Yes, the culprit has just killed a man, so he must just run away right ?!

1135
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:41,800
So yes.

1136
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:47,140
But I feel if the culprit has a strong emotional bond with the carp...

1137
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,140
... therefore he can not treat karuta harshly.

1138
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,480
Detectives always make a strange conclusion.

1139
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:57,320
Well, it's all up to your deduction.

1140
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,480
Just so you know...

1141
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,820
... it has nothing to do with me.

1142
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,030
Oh-Oh yeah!

1143
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,200
What's up ?!

1144
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,120
The pavilion floor creaks...

1145
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,120
... when something is running. You remember?

1146
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:11,370
What's up with that?

1147
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:16,630
The voice of the cries can tell someone in the room if anyone wants to enter.

1148
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,000
The body of the victim does not show any traces of fights...

1149
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,670
So yes.

1150
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,260
What you want to say is Yajima must know the culprit?

1151
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:25,470
But that's not true!

1152
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,260
Even when practicing alone, karuta requires a high level of concentration...

1153
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,980
... once you focus on playing, you will not realize the trivial thing like the sounds around you.

1154
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:37,150
So Yajima can get killed because he is not aware of anyone entering.

1155
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,730
That's not possible.

1156
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,570
The severe injury Yajima received was on his forehead.

1157
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,320
Even though he does not realize there are people who enter because of the focus of playing karuta...

1158
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:51,620
... the injury should be on the back or side of his head.

1159
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:57,670
In other words, the only reason he can get such injuries is because Yajima and the culprit know each other.

1160
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,710
The culprit loves karuta, knowing Yajima...

1161
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,970
... and did not have an alibi when the incident occurred.

1162
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:07,550
The culprit will also benefit from his death.

1163
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,050
This is very strange.

1164
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,310
Everything you say shows me that it is me. Just so you know...

1165
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:16,100
... your babbling so far is only conjecture.

1166
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,690
If you want to accuse me as the culprit, you must have strong evidence.

1167
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,940
Mr. Sekine, it's time.

1168
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:23,900
Come with me.

1169
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:28,160
Well, it's time! Too bad, but I have to go now.

1170
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,120
See you again.

1171
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,950
Before you leave, I want to ask you one more thing.

1172
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,000
You're stubborn. What else?

1173
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,870
Something you said earlier drew my attention.

1174
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,960
I'm not sure if you remember it.

1175
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:44,340
If the Satsuki Cup that has become this tradition fails only because of the death of Yajima, maybe his soul will not even calm down.

1176
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,920
It is hopeless he was beaten to death.

1177
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:48,180
That's what you said.

1178
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:53,010
After hearing that the cause of his death is katana, you should assume that it must be to stab or to slashing.

1179
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,060
But you explicitly say "hit".

1180
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:01,400
Only the perpetrator will know that his katana forgot not to be removed from its scabbard.

1181
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,480
How can you say "beaten" to death?

1182
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:07,780
I-That's because I saw his corpse at the scene.

1183
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,030
Enough!

1184
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:12,530
His body was put in the body bag when you got there.

1185
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:16,660
So you will not have a chance to see it.

1186
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,500
Be-I see... I'm just nonsense.

1187
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:26,170
I think if you die beaten after seeing the splash of blood!

1188
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:29,130
However I have nothing to do with this murder!

1189
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,930
It's very disrespectful.

1190
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,510
I wonder if he will be shocked and affect his behavior?

1191
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,390
Now all we have to do is...

1192
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,480
Check out the venue.

1193
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:43,690
Well. I've actually been looking for information, it seems to be a bit difficult.

1194
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:47,030
Really! This place is huge!

1195
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,860
What building is on the cliff?

1196
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,280
Hall of Satsuki.

1197
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:53,030
Satsuki? Is not that...

1198
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:57,540
Right. The place was built in honor of his wife Pak Achiwa, Mrs. Satsuki.

1199
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,750
hence the name is given.

1200
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:08,380
So yes. Only two final participants and a reader, Mr. Achiwa, are allowed to go up there once a year.

1201
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:14,010
The game is recorded using the camera and microphone already installed there...

1202
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:17,850
... then it will be broadcast in the audience hall on the other side of the river.

1203
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,680
Excessive.

1204
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:26,440
It is said that the humidity and temperature inside the hall remain constant due to the air circulation system.

1205
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:33,660
And the soundproofed walls will completely muffle the sound from the outside. The system installed there is an art of its own.

1206
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:38,450
They build the ideal state of the environment just to play karuta ?!

1207
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,210
I'm hungry!

1208
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,800
Let's go to where to eat!

1209
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,460
I want a cake!

1210
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,720
Then, I stay first huh?

1211
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:54,430
Have fun.

1212
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:56,780
Kak Ran!

1213
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:58,470
Let's get going!

1214
00:56:58,550 --> 00:56:59,560
Dah, until later.

1215
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,390
See you later.

1216
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:01,560
Be careful.

1217
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:02,810
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1218
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,630
The souvenir runs out later if not quickly.

1219
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:05,450
Auntie!

1220
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:06,980
Let's start the exercise again!

1221
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,570
Hold on for a while!

1222
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,700
If you lack sleep, your energy will not be enough to get to the finals.

1223
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:14,030
I'm fine!

1224
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:19,620
Kazuha, a-is it Mrs. Shizuka? Could it be the former Queen who trained you?

1225
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,450
Well.

1226
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,700
That's great.

1227
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,080
If this is possible you can win.

1228
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:27,540
Let's go back to the room and start training ?!

1229
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,130
If you really want to practice like that...

1230
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,380
... how about trying to fight me?

1231
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:36,470
I'm not sure this girl will get to the final.

1232
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,510
What are you saying!

1233
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,060
Calm down Kazuha!

1234
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:44,230
Auntie!

1235
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,860
I will be your opponent, are you willing?

1236
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,650
Former Queen! Bu Ikenami Shizuka!

1237
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,230
Why are you doing all this for the girl?

1238
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,360
So you want to compete with me?

1239
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,410
If you insist...

1240
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:58,910
... with pleasure.

1241
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:06,170
Pak Achiwa and Sekine?

1242
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:12,090
Looks like they will go to the Achiwa Compound Building and train for tomorrow's game.

1243
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:16,260
They were escorted by police on the way there, so no worries.

1244
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:19,510
But the problem will start when they get there.

1245
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,100
What about Momiji?

1246
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:21,970
Do not worry!

1247
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:25,310
He lives in Kyoto, he will leave with the others.

1248
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,150
Ah, briefly. There's a phone.

1249
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:33,730
The person in the photo you sent me, I've managed to identify it.

1250
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,240
What? Is it true?

1251
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,780
Yes. You might be shocked to find out.

1252
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:41,160
I sent the details by e-mail, do not forget to read!

1253
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,660
Thank you. Then, what about his karuta cards?

1254
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:48,670
I'm running the current penganalisanya program, Professor who made.

1255
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:52,460
I think I'll be able to find the card in the next hour.

1256
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:56,340
Great. Immediately contact me when I've met.

1257
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:57,130
Okay.

1258
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:00,640
Geez.

1259
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,620
From: Haibara
Subject: Do not forget the souvenir!
I sent you the profile of Nagoro.

1260
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,140
Nagoro Shikao.

1261
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:09,100
I have not felt this happy for a long time.

1262
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:10,770
Thank you very much.

1263
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,480
Come back, Iori ?!

1264
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:13,230
Good.

1265
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,150
Even though you're brave enough, but...

1266
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,070
... my level that is still this far has surprised you. Do you still want to join the tournament?

1267
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,290
Remember this is fine! My name is Momiji.

1268
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,450
Momiji: The leaves are red.

1269
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,410
I'm different from ordinary leaves like you.

1270
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,410
The words "Kazuha" can be read "Happa": Literally meaning leaf.

1271
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:28,910
D-Leaf?

1272
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:30,670
Enough!

1273
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,340
I will not hold back, even if my enemy is a beginner like you.

1274
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,510
I've made a mistake by underestimating my previous opponent, the result I lost a landslide.

1275
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:44,010
I do not want to feel ashamed like that anymore.

1276
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,680
That is why I will play earnestly with all my capabilities.

1277
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:49,850
I-That's what I want!

1278
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:52,730
Well, let's just talk about his karuta.

1279
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:57,780
Are you okay still here? Would not this make the president worried?

1280
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,450
I thank you for your attention to me, but I'm fine.

1281
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:06,580
That's because the famous western detective, Hattori Heiji, is always watching me.

1282
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,370
What do you mean ?!

1283
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,880
Ah, do not you know ?! Heiji is now my bodyguard.

1284
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,210
Huh ?!

1285
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:19,880
He has been keeping an eye on my house since yesterday.

1286
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,340
All right, then I'll excuse you first.

1287
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,930
I'm looking forward to our match tomorrow.

1288
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:31,020
Ah, Heiji, that insolent child.

1289
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:32,730
Hey, Kazuha ?!

1290
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:33,520
You're okay right?

1291
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:34,730
Heiji !!

1292
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:40,440
I do not know what you've done with that woman, but I'm gonna destroy it at the karuta tournament tomorrow!

1293
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,070
See it later, Heiji !!

1294
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:46,160
Well, all right then.

1295
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:49,620
What's up Hattori ?!

1296
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,290
I do not know why, all of a sudden the hairs on my neck stood up and felt very cold!

1297
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:55,750
Did you catch a cold?

1298
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:58,460
Catch the wind? No, it's not like that...

1299
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:00,800
... this is a sign of something creepy.

1300
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,720
Ah, they are passing!

1301
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:06,680
President of Achiwa.

1302
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,260
Ooka Momiji.

1303
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,810
And also Sekine.

1304
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:11,600
Everything is together.

1305
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:33,370
M-Could it be.

1306
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:36,380
The car is Sekine.

1307
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,550
So how is Sekine current?

1308
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:46,010
The hospital has given news...

1309
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,930
... it looks like he's still unconscious.

1310
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,600
The probability of life expectancy is 50:50.

1311
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:55,350
Ooka also hit by explosion, is she okay?

1312
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,400
He is not hurt, but just in case...

1313
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:02,570
... he and his driver, Iori, are undergoing an examination at the hospital.

1314
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:07,870
Since this case is becoming more and more, you have to say everything you know.

1315
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:09,200
Pak Achiwa.

1316
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,120
Bomb blast at Nichiuri TV...

1317
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:16,790
... we suspect that the target is the members of Satsuki-Kai.

1318
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:19,880
Hey, uncle.

1319
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:22,800
Do you know Pak Nagoro Shikao?

1320
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,220
Bo-Boy, that photo... where do you come from?

1321
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:28,390
You look very surprised, then you must know who this person is?

1322
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,800
If you know something...

1323
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,600
... please share the information with us without any cover-ups, Mr. Achiwa.

1324
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:39,350
There is a karuta association in Kyoto called Nagoro-Kai.

1325
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:41,980
They teach certain streams that are very elite.

1326
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:46,700
Its members, who are not even more than 20 people, undergo a rigorous daily training routine each month.

1327
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:50,450
Nagoro Shikao is the leader.

1328
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:52,830
He is so talented.

1329
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:57,410
People say if only a matter of time he can compete with Meijin.

1330
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,920
But he is very insistent when playing.

1331
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:04,630
Honestly, judging from wherever, the style of play is very far from the word beautiful.

1332
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:10,050
Hey, I'm faster! The card is mine!

1333
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,890
No! I did not touch the wrong card! Can not you see ya ?!

1334
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:20,350
About five years ago, let's say Nagoro challenged the then president, Satsuki.

1335
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:24,070
Provided that the loser must dissolve his association.

1336
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:26,940
What ?! Does not that sound like a yaburi dojo?

1337
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,150
Dojo Yaburi: Challenging a dojo with the aim of destroying or dispersing it.

1338
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:30,910
But Mrs. Satsuki does not accept the challenge right?

1339
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:37,410
Nagoro leaked all information about the challenge to the media, Satsuki inevitably have to accept it.

1340
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:41,920
He says if Satsuki-Kai is afraid of fighting Nagoro-Kai and will definitely refuse to compete.

1341
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,130
So yes.

1342
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:46,710
So he is in a difficult position to be able to resist his challenge.

1343
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,550
Then, the game itself?

1344
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,090
It never happened.

1345
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,680
Nagoro does not appear in the scheduled time.

1346
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:01,230
Thus his match is considered a failure and Satsuki is declared the winner.

1347
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:05,940
Nagoro who escaped from the match when the game will be covered by a very large media...

1348
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:10,860
... because of his own actions, is the biggest disgrace in the world of karuta.

1349
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,410
Then he disappears from the public spotlight.

1350
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,220
So...

1351
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:17,200
... what happened to Pak Nagoro and Nagoro-Kai now?

1352
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:20,580
Nagoro-Kai is disbanded over his president's defeat.

1353
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:23,500
Nagoro himself until now has not known its existence.

1354
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:28,710
What is possible if Nagoro, driven by his hatred of Satsuki-Kai, is the mastermind behind all this.

1355
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:34,510
I do not know. But the person who really wants Nagoro-Kai to be dissolved is...

1356
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:37,010
... The late Yajima.

1357
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:38,310
What ?!

1358
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:44,270
We, Satsuki-Kai, are eager to settle the matter peacefully so things do not get worse.

1359
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:45,560
Even so...

1360
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,480
What about the other Nagoro-Kai members?

1361
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:52,450
Anyone who wants to join Satsuki-Kai will be gladly accepted.

1362
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:55,620
But, only they both decide to join.

1363
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,080
Could they both be...?

1364
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:01,330
Right. They are Ooka and Sekine.

1365
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:04,120
The two men were involved in the explosion.

1366
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:11,380
Yes. Especially Ooka, who studies Nagoro's special techniques to perfect his abilities.

1367
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:14,220
Which of his favorite cards is almost the same as his teacher first.

1368
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:19,850
The six cards containing the momiji poems inside have never escaped their decks.

1369
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:23,140
He is Nagoro's first student and also the best.

1370
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,900
Why Pak Nagoro's favorite cards should contain the momiji poems?

1371
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:30,280
Since Nagoro's first name is Shikao.

1372
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:34,910
Shikao: The stag.

1373
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:31,400
Venison ?!

1374
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:34,910
Venison: Shika niku.

1375
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:34,900
Yes. The venison is often called the momiji right?

1376
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,910
Venison can be called autumn foliage.

1377
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:42,080
It may be very unpleasant for Nagoro because his beloved pupil joins Satsuki-Kai and is active there.

1378
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:48,960
But why is his revenge now? Besides, what is the reason for sending threats to us?

1379
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:53,340
We still do not know the reason for not doing anything for the last five years.

1380
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:58,050
But maybe the bomb threat indicates that he has returned.

1381
01:05:58,800 --> 01:05:59,930
Means...

1382
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:04,850
... we are deliberately told to see the serial action of revenge Nagoro Shikao against Satsuki-Kai.

1383
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,560
Excuse me for a moment.

1384
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,610
What is this? Good.

1385
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:14,900
I think we should cooperate in an investigation with the Kyoto Prefectural Police.

1386
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:15,780
Right.

1387
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,070
What ?!

1388
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:23,700
Inspector! We have checked Sekine's cell phone, it seems like she received a weird message just before the explosion happened.

1389
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:24,910
The strange message?

1390
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:30,250
We have not been able to confirm who the sender is, but the message is just a cargo card drawing.

1391
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,130
What kind of cargo card?

1392
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:36,800
At the moment it is non-negotiable.

1393
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,850
Look at Mount Tamuke, it becomes beautiful because of the red foliage.

1394
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,390
That's Nagoro's favorite card!

1395
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,220
What ?!

1396
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:45,230
What's wrong, Heiji ?!

1397
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:46,940
I have to make sure now!

1398
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:48,600
Momiji is in danger!

1399
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:51,980
Is this Iori?

1400
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:53,900
This voice, Mr. Hattori ?!

1401
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:59,610
Right. Please check my Momiji inbox immediately if there is a message from an unknown sender!

1402
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,120
Inbox message?

1403
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:02,990
Is something wrong, Iori?

1404
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:04,830
This is a phone call from Mr. Hattori.

1405
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:06,540
Heiji ?!

1406
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:08,040
Let me talk to him Iori!

1407
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:09,290
Momiji!

1408
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:11,080
Immediately check your message inbox!

1409
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:13,670
Inbox? What's wrong all of a sudden ?!

1410
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:18,430
Besides, I'm really glad you called Heiji.

1411
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,220
Ah, what exactly do you mean?

1412
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,430
Here there is only a picture submission.

1413
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,680
What is a caruta card image ?!

1414
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,140
Not possible! How do you know?

1415
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,640
What card is that? Quickly read it!

1416
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:34,020
Due to the storm wind blast from the slopes of Mount Mimuro, maple leaves are falling.

1417
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,280
Momiji, listen carefully! Do not go anywhere tonight!

1418
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:39,610
And do not go home!

1419
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:41,660
Go to the Osaka Police Station right now!

1420
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:42,410
Understand ?!

1421
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,660
Even if you ask for it yourself, but I still can not do that.

1422
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:49,250
I have to prepare for Satsuki Cup tomorrow, so...

1423
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,880
You have no right to say that now! Chances are you've been the next target, you know ?!

1424
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,750
I'll be fine.

1425
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,840
Anyway, I have you Heiji.

1426
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:00,220
You will protect me right?

1427
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,050
Huh ?!

1428
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:04,180
Because I never forget the promise.

1429
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,260
Promise ?!

1430
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:06,600
Already yes!

1431
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,520
The stupid guy, he hung up the phone.

1432
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,400
It seems that he also received a picture message in the form of a karuta card.

1433
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:14,440
Right.

1434
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:18,570
Otaki! Tightening up on Ooka Momiji, now!

1435
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:19,280
Ready!

1436
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,370
This means only Yajima does not receive the card message karuta.

1437
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:29,870
But actually there is a message coming from the karuta card at the Yajima murder scene.

1438
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:34,210
Meaning, after killing Yajima, Mr. Nagoro, the real culprit...

1439
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:37,880
... leave his favorite card there and escape from the scene.

1440
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:42,680
Then Sekine comes afterwards and hides that fact.

1441
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:48,680
So yes. Sekine must have realized that Nagoro who had committed the murder was seeing the message at the crime scene...

1442
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:55,020
... so he ruffled the victim's house to disguise his ex-teacher's actions as if it were a robber.

1443
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:59,940
That means Sekine arrived at the scene before the police?

1444
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:02,650
Yeah, chances are like that.

1445
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:06,410
Actually we have someone to analyze the pictures from the scene for us.

1446
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:09,910
By judging by the angle and shape of the splash of blood present in the card...

1447
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:09,910
Here it is!

1448
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,920
... we can know the true state of the scene.

1449
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,500
Please pay attention to the TV!

1450
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:21,130
On the right you can see the cards scattered on the floor and blood-stained from Yajima.

1451
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:28,350
Then, on the left there are cards that are still clean and that have blood stains that are then randomized.

1452
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:33,020
So from the faint distortion caused by how the blood is splashed...

1453
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,350
... the card held by Yajima is...

1454
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,730
Card number 32!

1455
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,690
Harumichi no Tsuraki!

1456
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:43,820
In the mountain stream, there is a barrier wall formed by a storm.

1457
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:46,740
But that's just a maple leaf, helpless to fly away.

1458
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:50,870
So far one of Mr. Nagoro's favorite cards is in Yajima's place!

1459
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,250
Please pay attention here. These are the cards used in the incident so far.

1460
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:57,250
Top left corner, Nichiuri TV.

1461
01:09:58,290 --> 01:09:59,130
Yajima.

1462
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:01,170
Sekine.

1463
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:04,420
This is the card Momiji received, which we are investigating.

1464
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:06,970
These cards have an equation.

1465
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:08,800
Everything contains the words "autumn foliage" or "momiji".

1466
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:12,640
As we all know, all the cards are his favorite Nagoro.

1467
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:17,770
It seems no doubt that the real offender is Nagoro Shikao.

1468
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:23,780
I do not think that's possible, but if it is Nagoro the culprit...

1469
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:30,660
I'm worried about the fact that there are six cards featuring "momiji" that Mr. Nagoro always uses.

1470
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:31,740
What do you mean?

1471
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:33,950
That means there are still two remaining cards that have not been used.

1472
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:34,750
Eh ?!

1473
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:39,500
If Pak Nagoro had used those karuta cards to indicate that he was the mastermind behind all this...

1474
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,750
... then he will not leave two unused cards.

1475
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,090
Could there be anyone other than the ooka...

1476
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:48,220
The question is, who is the target matching the two remaining cards?

1477
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:52,640
If we do not solve it soon, it will be difficult to protect them from Mr. Nagoro.

1478
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:57,230
Good work, both of you! I have a feeling that you can stop Nagoro before the police.

1479
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:00,810
But we still need more information.

1480
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:04,610
Say, what happened between you and Pak Nagoro five years ago?

1481
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:06,150
B-Okay.

1482
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,490
So there is still something huh ?!

1483
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:09,490
Something you did not say before!

1484
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:14,490
Right. I did not say it, but since there's only two of you here, it should not matter.

1485
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:17,290
Let's go back to my hotel!

1486
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,000
I'll tell you what really happened that day.

1487
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,710
You guys wait till i come back huh?

1488
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,880
I'm giving this back to Momiji first.

1489
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:27,620
Good!

1490
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:29,300
We are waiting for you!

1491
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,720
Young lady, the police just got in touch.

1492
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,470
Looks like they are improving the guard around the house.

1493
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,180
It's okay, it does not matter.

1494
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:38,270
Excuse me!

1495
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:42,150
You're Momiji right? My name is Mouri. I was the one who called.

1496
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,520
Ah, so that was you ?!

1497
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:48,240
Thank you very much for bothering to come here to return it to me.

1498
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,610
T-No problem.

1499
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,490
This, this thing is yours right, Momiji, right?

1500
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:57,120
Thank you very much! It's like a lucky charm for me!

1501
01:11:57,490 --> 01:12:00,250
Without this, I'm really very worried about the tournament tomorrow.

1502
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:01,920
But now I'm relieved.

1503
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:07,260
It's like you've reached out to help your enemy.

1504
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:08,420
No, no.

1505
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:12,720
I hope the girl does not hurt her finger from practicing too hard.

1506
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:14,510
Wow, those nails are so beautiful!

1507
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:18,100
Ah, this I use to protect my fingertips.

1508
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:22,980
Because it is an asset for the player karuta, besides when practicing, I always wear it.

1509
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,480
Ah, so so.

1510
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:29,110
By the way I've opened the wallet to find your address.

1511
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,240
There is a photo.

1512
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,490
What is this photo you mean?

1513
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,290
The person in the photo...?

1514
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:38,870
It's Heiji.

1515
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:39,910
I thought so.

1516
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:45,840
This is a picture of my childhood when I lost to Heiji in the karuta tournament.

1517
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:49,050
As I cry for losing, Heiji tells me...

1518
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:56,970
Do not cry! I'll make you my wife when we meet again, so just wait.

1519
01:12:58,510 --> 01:12:59,310
Be-Really?

1520
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:00,390
Yes.

1521
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:02,600
I promise.

1522
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:03,560
Heh ?!

1523
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,860
So that's the real statement of love.

1524
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:09,070
Because of that promise Heiji is my future husband.

1525
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:12,030
T-But that's just a promise of children!

1526
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:13,860
Children or adults alike!

1527
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:18,370
The real man will not break his promise easily right ?!

1528
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:23,710
In order to accurately summarize the heart of the girl I love.

1529
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:25,500
Right.

1530
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:27,170
Although the water flow is fast,

1531
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,630
branched off because of a large rock,

1532
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:32,510
will definitely be united again at the mouth of the river.

1533
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:37,180
It means that in any case you will be separated, your heart will remain connected.

1534
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,390
I always believe that.

1535
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:43,020
Please tell this to Happa-chan!

1536
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,310
H-Happa-chan?

1537
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:47,810
Once I point my gaze at a card, I will not let anyone take it from me!

1538
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,940
My teacher taught me!

1539
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:52,320
Momiji.

1540
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,240
Ran!

1541
01:13:55,690 --> 01:14:00,410
Why are you daydreaming? Your behavior is so strange after returning from the streets keliliing Osaka, Ran!

1542
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:03,410
Sorry! What about your practice?

1543
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:11,210
Well, his mother Heiji gave me the task of choosing the favorite card I would use in the competition.

1544
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:13,760
But I still have not found which card suits me.

1545
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,380
Is it that difficult?

1546
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:20,100
Hyakunin Isshu has a lot of love poems right?

1547
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:22,470
Do not think about the tournament.

1548
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,560
Just pick a poem that you can easily understand.

1549
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:27,650
Love ya...

1550
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,400
If it were me, I would choose this one!

1551
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:35,240
"Meguri aite", Murasaki Shikibu right?

1552
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,070
We met at the intersection, but I do not know if it was him. Because the moon at night disappears behind the clouds.

1553
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:39,910
It was a poem about a friend who suddenly disappeared in a meeting that had been eagerly awaited.

1554
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:44,370
Wherever I think if I'm going to meet him, he just disappears somewhere.

1555
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,040
Yet there are still many who want to talk to him you know.

1556
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:49,460
Right. If so...

1557
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,460
I am...

1558
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:58,180
Even though I hide it, it will still be visible on my face, the person I love, my secret love.

1559
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:01,390
And people ask me, is there anything bothering you?

1560
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,140
Poems about love that can not possibly be hidden.

1561
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:08,440
That's perfect for you Kazuha! Even Momiji can also find out.

1562
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,730
Talk about him, I wonder why he can be so confident.

1563
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,400
He speaks as if he already is a fiancée of Heiji.

1564
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:16,610
Hey, Ran! You also think so right ?!

1565
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,700
Ah, right.

1566
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,240
I can not tell her that when I was a kid...

1567
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,410
... Hattori once proposed to Momiji.

1568
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:30,080
What ?! Pak Nagoro came to play with Mrs. Satsuki the day before the day of the match?

1569
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:31,250
Is it true ?!

1570
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:33,800
Yes. I was away.

1571
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:39,550
The article mentions that Nagoro escaped from the game for fear of fighting Satsuki, but...

1572
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,760
... he actually came the day before.

1573
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,930
But why the day before?

1574
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:48,560
Who knows. We would not know if we did not ask Nagoro ourselves, but maybe...

1575
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:54,190
... Satsuki says that Nagoro wants to defeat him using Satsuki-Kai karuta card.

1576
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,940
He uses that karuta ?!

1577
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:58,440
But karats Satsuki-Kai right...

1578
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:00,990
... stored in a museum ?!

1579
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,790
No one wants it then, so we keep it at home.

1580
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:09,000
But the match can not be held without the reader right?

1581
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,040
We keep a lot of tapes on our shelves.

1582
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:15,960
We use it to practice karuta.

1583
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:18,170
So, how's the match?

1584
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,470
Satsuki won it brilliantly.

1585
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:23,180
Nagoro is no match.

1586
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:30,560
I still remember his pale face as I rushed out the front door after I got home.

1587
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:33,980
That's the last time I saw it.

1588
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:37,320
Why do not you tell the police ?!

1589
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:41,450
I'm afraid the information will leak to the media and other Satsuki-Kai members if I tell you.

1590
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:49,040
If they find out the legendary caruta used in such unofficial rivalry, there will be commotion among the members.

1591
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:52,290
Well, that does not mean I can not understand your reasoning.

1592
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:55,590
I mean, it's not that I do not trust the police...

1593
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,460
Is this... something wrong with this photo.

1594
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:03,130
Maybe because Mr. Achiwa's car is different from the present one.

1595
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:06,430
Please stop Nagoro's crime as soon as possible.

1596
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,390
Of course! You can count on us.

1597
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,270
Ran, just two will not be enough.

1598
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:14,560
Can you add two more?

1599
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:17,620
My brain needs a lot of sugar intake.

1600
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:18,820
O-Okay.

1601
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:20,610
He knows just from his voice?

1602
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,320
This girl...

1603
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:28,660
Kakoi-te (close hands): close the card by hand.
Watari-te (crossed arms): snapping away two different cards spread far apart.

1604
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:27,240
This is bad, I still can not use kakoi-te or watari-te well.

1605
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,120
I also still can not predict the course of the game, if not immediately I fix...

1606
01:17:30,990 --> 01:17:33,710
... Heiji. The woman will take Heiji.

1607
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,920
What's wrong Kazuha?

1608
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:36,830
You look moody?

1609
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,210
Heiji ?!

1610
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,760
Do you fight with someone?

1611
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,260
Be quiet you're stupid!

1612
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:44,760
You're the bodyguard of that woman right?

1613
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,260
Go there, just go back to him!

1614
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:51,560
What the hell is this. And I want to replace my tired Mama to play against you.

1615
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:54,270
I do not ever lose playing karuta against you know.

1616
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:56,560
That was when we were in elementary school!

1617
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,360
You are not my match now!

1618
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:04,070
Hey, hey, Hattori. Do not you remember something about a karuta tournament when you were in elementary school?

1619
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,320
Maybe something about a girl crying after losing to you?

1620
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:11,540
Oh, right! Kazuha, I met him in a karuta tournament!

1621
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:14,250
The only tournament that you follow and you even win it is not it?

1622
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:18,500
Well. There is a girl crying because she lost to me!

1623
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,630
The boy is Ooka Momiji!

1624
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,590
So the girl...

1625
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:24,760
So, Hattori. Do you remember it?

1626
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:25,630
Remember what?

1627
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:28,850
Like you ever promised something to Momiji maybe...?

1628
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,060
As I recall I said this to him "try harder when we meet again".

1629
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,100
In addition, you hurry back to him!

1630
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:36,480
You have to protect that woman right?

1631
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:38,230
But the police are already...

1632
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:39,270
Whatever, it's important to go!

1633
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:41,770
If he gets injured before the tournament starts...

1634
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,860
... he will not be able to join right ?!

1635
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,110
Are you serious?

1636
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:47,610
All right then.

1637
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,070
Mama, I leave it to you.

1638
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:50,620
Okay.

1639
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:57,170
Even though I hide it, it will still be visible on my face, the person I love, my secret love.

1640
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:01,840
And people ask me, is there anything bothering you?

1641
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:08,840
Pak Guru Nagoro.

1642
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,510
Please lend me your strength again this year.

1643
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,190
Please guard me...

1644
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:23,110
... Satsuki.

1645
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:30,660
Kyoto

1646
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:33,870
Achiwa Compound Building

1647
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:39,000
In the Bay of Naniwa, the flowers are now blooming, having been dormant throughout the winter.

1648
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:48,670
Now spring has arrived and the flowers begin to bloom.

1649
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:58,940
Now spring has arrived and the flowers begin to bloom.

1650
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:07,360
From Mount Yoshino, blowing cool breeze, autumn wind.

1651
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,150
Kak Kazuha got it!

1652
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:10,280
He wears clothes that are different from other players, so we can easily see them.

1653
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,070
Right.

1654
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:13,530
Is not he wearing aikidogi?

1655
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:14,220
Why is Conan not watching with us?

1656
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,790
Well that's it.

1657
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:18,660
He said he would go somewhere with Kak Heiji.

1658
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:24,290
Ah, right! Let's send to Conan Genta's photo at the souvenir shop!

1659
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,710
Photo when he got angry?

1660
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:31,510
The eight-fold cherry blossom in Nara, our ancient capital, has been blooming.

1661
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:30,420
It looks like the show has started.

1662
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:31,090
Yes.

1663
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:35,220
There is no way for Nagoro to break in with this tight security.

1664
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:37,470
Right. Not just Nagoro...

1665
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,310
... employees who had been fired were also not allowed to enter.

1666
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,310
We have also checked all employees seriously.

1667
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:47,570
We will not allow any gap for Nagoro to enter.

1668
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:49,900
What's up Hattori ?!

1669
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,700
Ah, it's nothing.

1670
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:54,280
Who is this?

1671
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,700
Oh, it's from Mitsuhiko.

1672
01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:01,910
Geez, what are you doing Genta? Gripping senmaizuke is like a hawk.

1673
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:02,040
Senmaizuke: Pickles made from sliced radish.

1674
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:04,250
So yes!

1675
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:10,840
As the dew promised, a hope for a thirsty plant.

1676
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,840
Aochwa Compound Guard Post

1677
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:32,400
The first momiji finishes it, according to our shadow.

1678
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:33,950
Kak Kazuha?

1679
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:35,450
Looks like he's still not done yet.

1680
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,450
Ah, is not that him!

1681
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:39,540
There it is! Kak Kazuha!

1682
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,250
You're great Kazuha!

1683
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:46,290
He won the first half, a good start.

1684
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:55,050
Pak Sekine? Mr. Sekine?

1685
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:39,260
Ooka Momiji

1686
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,260
Toyama Kazuha

1687
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,260
Final

1688
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,430
Thank you very much.

1689
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:44,640
Oh, so that girl can get to the final.

1690
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,730
This is shocking! We do not know of any very talented participants among us.

1691
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:51,440
Great!

1692
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:52,940
Maybe he'll be a champion ?!

1693
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:53,990
Of course!

1694
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,610
Great Kazuha! If you keep playing like this, your victory is confirmed!

1695
01:22:58,110 --> 01:22:59,660
I wonder what Kazuha understands...

1696
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:04,040
... if he should declare his love for Hattori if he can defeat Momiji.

1697
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,290
Kazuha. He tried very hard.

1698
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:09,630
He will play Momiji shortly.

1699
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:10,290
Well.

1700
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:11,380
What ?!

1701
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,170
Sekine already aware?

1702
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:17,510
Well! So our guess is right ?!

1703
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:21,260
Understandable! I'll leave this to the Kyoto Police and I'll be right there.

1704
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,060
Sekine already aware?

1705
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,310
Right, it seems so.

1706
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:26,810
More or less everything is like Heiji's suspicions.

1707
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:30,020
But there is a need what Sekine visit Yajima's house?

1708
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:34,400
It seems that lately Yajima is looking for Nagoro.

1709
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:41,490
Sekine knows it, it seems that he's keeping an eye on Yajima and wants to know if Yajima knows something about his former teacher.

1710
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:44,830
Then, when he realizes that something is wrong...

1711
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:46,160
... he even found a corpse.

1712
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:51,920
It's possible. I hope we can hear the whole story directly from Sekine upon our return to Osaka.

1713
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:52,590
Yes.

1714
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,050
Now just trust to the Kyoto Prefectural Police.

1715
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:55,800
Good.

1716
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:58,470
Ah, wait a minute! I'm coming with you.

1717
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:04,100
This is the last one.

1718
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:08,730
But, what's the importance of putting dynamite in a place like this?

1719
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,810
What's with the smoke?

1720
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:14,230
Fire?

1721
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,530
No, the alarm does not sound so it's not a fire!

1722
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:17,740
Could it be a bomb blast ?!

1723
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:19,360
Hey, hey! No kidding!

1724
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:21,070
Is not it outside that is very noisy ?!

1725
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,080
What place is in the western forest?

1726
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:27,410
Ah, there is only an old warehouse.

1727
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:29,040
Does the camera show anything?

1728
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:31,620
The area is out of range, so there is no camera.

1729
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:32,420
What ?!

1730
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:35,250
Hey, that smoke, is it possible?

1731
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:36,750
Well. Come on!

1732
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:44,890
We are going to the Satsuki Hall there.

1733
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,680
What smell is this?

1734
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:53,730
Ah, the elevator has improved recently.

1735
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:56,400
This smell may come from the oil they use.

1736
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,440
Are you bothered?

1737
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,650
No, not so...

1738
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,200
... maybe I'm just too excited.

1739
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,990
This does make me excited.

1740
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,660
What do you feel now?

1741
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:09,160
Well, I did not expect to get this far...

1742
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,660
... so I'm very excited. I guess you're not like me?

1743
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:14,630
You're wrong, I feel my heart seems to be dislodged.

1744
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:21,720
I can not stop thinking about Heiji's face when I express my feelings for her.

1745
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:25,800
I... I can not lose to him. Will not!

1746
01:25:28,050 --> 01:25:29,470
Do not come near!

1747
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:31,140
What's going on ?!

1748
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:31,980
Inspector!

1749
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:33,810
Is there an explosion?

1750
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:35,650
Right. The victim was one person.

1751
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,480
His body severely injured...

1752
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:40,440
... we can not identify the body with that condition.

1753
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:41,820
So yes.

1754
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:43,860
The question is, when and how...

1755
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:45,660
... the bomb could be planted here?

1756
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:49,620
From the scene of the crime scene we have a possibility that the survivors themselves planted the explosives.

1757
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:50,450
What ?!

1758
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,150
Pak Nagoro accidentally blew himself up ?!

1759
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,330
Please start autopsinya as soon as possible!

1760
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:54,210
Good!

1761
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,920
Hello? Here is Ayanokoji.

1762
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:02,460
What's wrong with Kudo?

1763
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,880
Hattori, look at that!

1764
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:07,180
What is it ?! A ring?

1765
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,970
Well, possibly belong to the victim.

1766
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:11,270
You found something?

1767
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,230
There! Look at that ring! The possibility of the victim.

1768
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,230
The ring is big enough.

1769
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:18,440
Well, that big ring is not something you see everyday.

1770
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:20,900
The ring is big enough... wait a minute!

1771
01:26:23,890 --> 01:26:24,740
Kaieda Togo!

1772
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,450
Kaieda ?! You mean his former secretary Pak Achiwa?

1773
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:29,870
Yes! No more mistake.

1774
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,160
Kaieda wears a ring like this on his thumb.

1775
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:36,120
What does that mean Kaieda is the real culprit ?!

1776
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,630
No! If we do not find the ring...

1777
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:42,090
... we must assume that it was Mr. Nagoro's body!

1778
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:46,960
That means the explosion was meant to make it look like Mr. Nagoro is dead.

1779
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,300
Wait...

1780
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:51,600
... if it should be today Mr. Nagoro died here...

1781
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:56,390
... surely two remaining cargo cards have been sent to someone right ?!

1782
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:00,400
Not two. Otaki just called me...

1783
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:05,070
... his secretary Pak Achiwa checks his message inbox again...

1784
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,910
... and Pak Achiwa apparently also received a picture message card karuta this morning.

1785
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,490
That means only one card left ?!

1786
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:14,950
There is only one card... and the final match.

1787
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:16,830
I understand!

1788
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:22,130
Because Mr. Achiwa has received his picture of his karuta card, it means there's only one left!

1789
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,960
So who will receive his final card (final)...

1790
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:26,760
... not yet certain!

1791
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:30,890
That means... Inspector! Please check out his phone Toyama Kazuha!

1792
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,300
Eh? OK.

1793
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:33,850
But what does all this mean?

1794
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:36,850
The reason why the last card has not been sent is...

1795
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:40,850
... the perpetrators do not know who will go to the final round!

1796
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,020
Means that the next target is...

1797
01:27:44,770 --> 01:27:46,530
... three people who are in Satsuki Hall ?!

1798
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:49,070
Previously I'm sorry.

1799
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:55,080
You two, take all your skills and show us a great game!

1800
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:57,750
Please help!

1801
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:05,920
In the Bay of Naniwa, the flowers are now blooming, having been dormant throughout the winter.

1802
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,280
One, two... fight!

1803
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:07,170
Kazuha, show them your true abilities!

1804
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:14,010
How, did he receive a picture card message karuta?

1805
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:17,600
Yes. 15 minutes ago, Nagoro's favorite card.

1806
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,020
I thought he would send it!

1807
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:23,270
You should immediately stop the final game, understand ?!

1808
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:24,320
This way Kudo!

1809
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,360
Hey, where are you going ?!

1810
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,980
Faster if you use a motorcycle!

1811
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:29,780
Eh ?! Stop the final game?

1812
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:31,320
Good! Understandable!

1813
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:33,320
I will try to contact the person in the Hall right now...

1814
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:40,250
What's this?

1815
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:44,710
Probably just a small earthquake. You do not have to worry.

1816
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,760
What ?! What happened?

1817
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,380
Maybe it's broken.

1818
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,510
What the hell. Why break the final fitting...

1819
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:53,390
What's the power outage?

1820
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:55,260
No, the lights here are still on.

1821
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,600
Shit! They've started it!

1822
01:28:57,670 --> 01:28:59,850
Right! A tight grip!

1823
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,650
Hattori! How do we get to the Satsuki Hall ?!

1824
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,400
Trust me! I have an idea.

1825
01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:09,610
Oi, is it possible?

1826
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:19,660
Bahwan the goddess who controls all in the past, I never heard it.

1827
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:15,700
As expected.

1828
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,910
Happa-chan has not moved.

1829
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:20,910
He ignored my favorite card.

1830
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:23,580
In this extreme difficulty...

1831
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,710
What ?! Why is the fire already this big ?!

1832
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,470
We suspect that there is something flammable in there.

1833
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,380
Have the firefighters not arrived yet ?!

1834
01:29:33,670 --> 01:29:37,050
The road is too narrow for a fire truck.

1835
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:40,270
And the disaster prevention system is also offline ?!

1836
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:41,140
Yes.

1837
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:42,940
So this is over yes?

1838
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,960
Hattori, do you still think the real culprit is Mr. Nagoro ?!

1839
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:20,180
No. There is only one person who can re-register Kaieda, who has left Satsuki-Kai, as an employee and gave him a bomb!

1840
01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:22,720
President Achiwa Kensuke.

1841
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,230
And he plans to commit suicide by involving the two men!

1842
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,650
I will not let him do it!

1843
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:37,200
The card is in a hard place to reach, and Momiji definitely knows it well if it's my favorite card!

1844
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,030
You want this card is not it?

1845
01:30:40,730 --> 01:30:44,250
But I will not let you get it! If I can secure it, my victory can be ascertained!

1846
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:48,500
I'll get it, for whatever's sake. I have to get it!

1847
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:54,800
Be still, be quiet!

1848
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,840
These insignificant voices, immediately get out of my mind!

1849
01:30:57,850 --> 01:31:00,350
What's wrong Kazuha? You look gloomy?

1850
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,220
Do you fight with someone?

1851
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:05,060
Please permit a moment!

1852
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:11,570
Right, I can not fight it.

1853
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:18,240
The sound of air conditioning, the sound of kimono friction, the sound when we touch the card, the breath sound is weak...

1854
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:22,620
... and the sound of my heartbeat, they are all friends!

1855
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:25,540
They allow me to enter my mind.

1856
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:30,920
Thanks time.

1857
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,590
I'll catch the right sound!

1858
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:41,390
With the pine growing there I will come back to you again.

1859
01:31:54,810 --> 01:32:00,200
We all assume that all this incident is Pak Nagoro's revenge action to Satsuki-Kai!

1860
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:02,280
But all that is just a story by Pak Achiwa for us.

1861
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:10,250
For a reason, five years ago, Mr. Nagoro appeared on the night before his game with Mrs. Satsuki.

1862
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:15,800
Pak Achiwa claimed that the winning moment was Mrs. Satsuki, but something was wrong with it.

1863
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:18,090
You mean the photo we saw in the article in the hotel first?

1864
01:32:18,710 --> 01:32:22,930
Well. Mr. Achiwa showed the article that contained Mrs. Satsuki's victory at that time.

1865
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,680
Is not she going to wash her car until the day before the game? But in that picture the car looks dirty!

1866
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:33,150
He did not wash his car the day before the game because he already knows Pak Nagoro will not come!

1867
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:38,110
My love is like the month before dawn, cold and unsympathetic.

1868
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:39,400
Looks like I'm faster.

1869
01:32:39,810 --> 01:32:41,950
No, I'm faster!

1870
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:47,040
Are you the right person to judge who is faster among us ?!

1871
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:52,920
I did not think they would do such an action in the final game.

1872
01:32:56,290 --> 01:33:02,220
If in the preliminary match five years ago Mrs. Satsuki lost, could not that be her motive?

1873
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:06,720
Well, and Pak Nagoro is purposely silenced for the purpose of protecting Satsuki-Kai's honor.

1874
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:13,560
Yajima realizes that his karuta card can be a proof that Mr. Achiwa has committed a crime.

1875
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:16,480
But what kind of evidence is that ?!

1876
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:21,320
What if Mr. Achiwa accidentally holds the stack of cards with his hands that are exposed to Mr. Nagoro's blood?

1877
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:22,950
You're right, fingerprints!

1878
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:25,660
I did not realize it until recently I saw a picture, but...

1879
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:29,620
... chances are that the caruta card still has his fingerprint Pak Achiwa.

1880
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:34,500
That's why Yajima suggests the idea of broadcast coverage of Satsuki-Kai...

1881
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:38,630
... so he can get a videotape of Satsuki-Kai's karuta as evidence.

1882
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:43,930
Well, that's why the Yajima was killed to coincide with a bomb blast in a TV studio.

1883
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:46,550
Right! But why...

1884
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:51,640
... why did he bring his crime in the final tournament in this Achiwa Compound Building?

1885
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:56,310
What if Mr. Nagoro's body was hidden in the Satsuki Hall, where the final match was held?

1886
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,190
That's right, it's the perfect place to hide it.

1887
01:33:59,730 --> 01:34:02,860
So... he has planned all his crimes from scratch ?!

1888
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,200
He must have made this perfect plan to describe Mr. Nagoro as the culprit.

1889
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:10,910
But, if his corpse can be found, he will lose everything.

1890
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:13,410
That's the aula!

1891
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:13,910
Well!

1892
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,670
I do not know where the ends are.

1893
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:22,550
The deep heart.

1894
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:23,050
The ghost card!

1895
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:25,260
The situation is getting worse, the fire has reached that level!

1896
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,300
We have to get there soon!

1897
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:29,260
How? In addition we have to extinguish the fire first!

1898
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:34,140
No time to hesitate! You just think how to extinguish the fire!

1899
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:36,310
And you? Impossible! You're kidding, right ?!

1900
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,480
We're starting, Kudo!

1901
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:52,920
Let's hurry!

1902
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:56,370
What's that ?!

1903
01:35:02,410 --> 01:35:04,090
Good! Now grew up!

1904
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,720
Quickly! We must succeed on time!

1905
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:10,890
What's... a fire ?!

1906
01:35:11,050 --> 01:35:12,510
Stop! Do not get out!

1907
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,850
Heiji? What are you doing here?!

1908
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:19,690
Oh! The direction of the waterfall changed!

1909
01:35:19,690 --> 01:35:20,350
This is a miracle!

1910
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:21,310
The fire is gone!

1911
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:23,280
What? What happened?!

1912
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,280
It seems we have done it in time somehow.

1913
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,160
Very good, Kudo.

1914
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:34,290
Heiji, what happened?

1915
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:36,790
I told you to stay inside, it's dangerous outside!

1916
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:40,880
Uh, is there Conan too? What is this? What are you two doing here?

1917
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:44,170
It may be easier if we ask Mr. Achiwa.

1918
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:45,760
What do you mean?

1919
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:48,260
The two of you, stay behind me.

1920
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,640
Why should we...?

1921
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:52,100
Hey, Mr. Achiwa.

1922
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:55,060
Would not a bad thing happen to you if someone checks these karuta cards?

1923
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:58,640
Hey, Heij, what have you done with all this ?!

1924
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:03,150
Let's start by hearing the explanation of what happened to this uncle.

1925
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:09,610
It started exactly a year ago when Momiji recorded his victory in this special hall.

1926
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:17,660
At that time, a set of cards belonging to Momiji was very similar to that of his teacher, Pak Nagoro, whom he used in certain matches.

1927
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:22,670
Our favorite cards are almost the same because Master Nagoro was the one who taught me to play karuta with seme-garuta style.

1928
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:22,670
Seme-garuta: The attacking style in karuta.

1929
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:26,250
But, it is an incredible coincidence to...

1930
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:28,510
Say coincidence is true.

1931
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:32,180
The black mark on this side of Satsuki-Kai karuta is...

1932
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:37,930
... surely the late Yajima noticed that it appeared from nowhere five years ago.

1933
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:40,230
What is the real black mark?

1934
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,940
It is the fingerprint of the man who holds his karuta with hands already exposed to Mr. Nagoro's blood.

1935
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:47,440
The blood of Guru Nagoro?

1936
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:50,650
Pak Nagoro who is thought to have disappeared since five years ago...

1937
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:52,530
... was killed at the time.

1938
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,200
Not possible.

1939
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:56,280
And the owner of that fingerprint is...

1940
01:36:57,530 --> 01:36:59,120
... the real culprit behind Pak Nagoro's murder.

1941
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:01,710
I have been defeated.

1942
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,580
I will admit it all.

1943
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:08,420
Instead, do not hand over Satsuki-Kai's karuta as evidence.

1944
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:10,630
For Satsuki-Kai, that...

1945
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:12,300
Oh, so that's it?

1946
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,010
There's something I can not understand, but you end up saying it.

1947
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:20,930
The fingerprints on this caruta are not yours, Mr. Achiwa!

1948
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:23,900
No, it's mine! Of course it's my fingerprint!

1949
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:25,360
Never mind...

1950
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:29,320
... it is true that you and Kaieda are behind the recent sequence of events.

1951
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:33,950
But you are not the murderer of Pak Nagoro five years ago!

1952
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:36,370
The culprit is Mrs. Satsuki.

1953
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:50,340
When I saw the incident, I realized everything...

1954
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:54,720
... Nagoro has challenged him then Satsuki has been defeated.

1955
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:02,850
They use cassettes that we always use instead of readers.

1956
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:05,400
Do you know what that means?

1957
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:09,650
Satsuki has often listened to it many times.

1958
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:12,570
Of course that's just one of our tapes...

1959
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:16,740
... but, he knows the composition of the card with the heart to some extent.

1960
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:20,950
He greatly benefited with it...

1961
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,580
... but he still lost.

1962
01:38:23,950 --> 01:38:27,710
Nagoro's ability exceeded what we imagined.

1963
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,920
I can only guess what kind of fear Satsuki feels...

1964
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:35,880
... because there is no doubt that he will definitely be embarrassed in the next game.

1965
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:40,640
Fear is what drives him to commit the crime.

1966
01:38:41,090 --> 01:38:44,600
After that, Satsuki get rid of all his human feelings...

1967
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:48,560
... to resign from the Satsuki-Kai management ranks.

1968
01:38:48,970 --> 01:38:52,820
Then, two years ago, he died of a serious illness from the misery.

1969
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:55,070
That is the truth.

1970
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:57,200
Please understand me.

1971
01:38:58,440 --> 01:38:58,910
Stop!

1972
01:38:59,480 --> 01:38:59,990
Do not do it!

1973
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:01,910
This is all wrong Nagoro.

1974
01:39:02,650 --> 01:39:06,370
If that person does not embarrass Satsuki, this will not be...

1975
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:07,960
He does not mean to embarrass him!

1976
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:11,710
Before Master Nagoro came to her the day before the game...

1977
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:15,130
... I asked him then...

1978
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:19,260
... the reason is to treat Satsuki-Kai as an enemy.

1979
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:24,680
Enemy? I thought it might seem that from the outside.

1980
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:27,940
But if it is not so, I will not be able to compete with him.

1981
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:32,650
I just want to hear it say "you're great" when I win...

1982
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:35,860
... as my enemy as well as my first love.

1983
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,860
C-Love first ?!

1984
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:44,490
Right. Master Nagoro admired Bu Satsuki and started playing karuta because of it.

1985
01:39:45,070 --> 01:39:49,670
However, doctors say that he only has one year to play karuta because of his eye condition.

1986
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,750
I think that is the reason his karuta style of play became very aggressive.

1987
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:56,800
Because Master has no time.

1988
01:39:57,460 --> 01:40:03,140
So he wants to show him his true abilities the day before the game, then let Mrs Satsuki win the real match.

1989
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:08,060
So that his students, including me, can not see him anymore...

1990
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:11,350
... has a reason to join Satsuki-Kai.

1991
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:16,860
Mrs. Satsuki did not know that and killed Mr Nagoro.

1992
01:40:17,770 --> 01:40:19,360
Ti-Not.

1993
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:26,450
What have I done?

1994
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:36,800
A-what is that ?!

1995
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,800
Kazuha!

1996
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:43,300
Kazuha!

1997
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:45,140
Are you okay ?!

1998
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:45,850
Yes!

1999
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:47,810
But I can not stand.

2000
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:54,980
All of you get into the elevators! Sakarang!

2001
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:56,860
Momiji! Come on, quickly!

2002
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:57,480
O-Okay.

2003
01:40:57,810 --> 01:40:59,320
Get up! Come on, quickly!

2004
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:01,740
Do not care about me. Leave me alone.

2005
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:05,240
Stop the nonsense. You can not die now!

2006
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,830
Momiji! come on, fast!

2007
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:09,120
Okay.

2008
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:11,460
Kazuha!

2009
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:13,330
Go crawling up to my place!

2010
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:14,290
Yes.

2011
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:15,590
Faster!

2012
01:41:16,490 --> 01:41:18,550
Emergency! Just a little more.

2013
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:20,470
Can be!

2014
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:23,640
What's...?!

2015
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:30,620
Please...

2016
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,270
... do not fall down!

2017
01:41:39,230 --> 01:41:40,690
Shit!

2018
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:48,990
What ?!

2019
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,340
I will not let you!

2020
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:09,720
Are you all right ?! We're right there!

2021
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:10,640
It was almost there.

2022
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:12,390
Hattori!

2023
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:19,940
This is bad... the building will collapse! Get out of here!

2024
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,290
Eh ?! Wait! Do not go!

2025
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:31,830
Heiji!

2026
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:33,000
Kazuha, get on!

2027
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:37,000
Hattori... Kazuha.

2028
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:39,670
Please, get out of there somehow!

2029
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:47,180
Heiji, look at that!

2030
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:47,840
Yes.

2031
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:50,510
What's up, Heiji?

2032
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,810
A tight grip!

2033
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:56,600
Not possible! Are you going to jump far across the river ?!

2034
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:58,310
Yes that's it! Great if you understand!

2035
01:42:58,430 --> 01:43:02,400
Are you kidding right? What do you think?! It is too far!

2036
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,150
Hey, Heiji!

2037
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:06,570
How about jumping into the lake instead?

2038
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:11,080
Impossible! if we jump from this distance, the surface of the water will feel hard like concrete!

2039
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:15,870
Pegangang yangatat, Kazuha! If you let it go...

2040
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:17,920
... I will kill you!

2041
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:19,630
All right.

2042
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:26,630
There is no other way...

2043
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:30,890
... we'll die if we stay here!

2044
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:35,180
That...

2045
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:36,060
... Hattori ?!

2046
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:40,440
There's still something I want to tell you!

2047
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:43,860
The motor.

2048
01:43:47,230 --> 01:43:50,530
Coming there!

2049
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,460
Heiji!

2050
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:04,340
Kazuha!

2051
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:18,390
Are you all right, Kazuha ?!

2052
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:20,440
Yes.

2053
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:24,230
I'm getting bored with this dramatic escape.

2054
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:30,280
Gosh... they both base.

2055
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:33,320
For a moment I thought we would not make it.

2056
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:34,910
By the way, Heiji.

2057
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,450
What do you want to tell me ?!

2058
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:39,750
A-What? What do you mean?

2059
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:43,880
Are not you the one telling yourself... if you can not die before saying something to me?

2060
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,460
Maybe you heard wrong?

2061
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:48,920
No! Since the weight of my listening karuta so sharp!

2062
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,800
No need to dodge, confess it!

2063
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:52,430
Ti-No, wait...

2064
01:44:53,210 --> 01:44:54,180
What's up ?!

2065
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:56,220
I've told you to wait, right ?!

2066
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:56,390
What do you want to tell me ?!

2067
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:58,020
The only thing I want to say to you is...

2068
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:45,160
Thank you for bringing us on our way.

2069
01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:47,660
We are the ones who should be grateful.

2070
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,410
Anyway... what happened to your Karuta Club?

2071
01:48:50,950 --> 01:48:57,050
Well, the school has appreciated my efforts to get to the final so the club does not get dissolved!

2072
01:48:57,580 --> 01:49:00,470
Even though I ended up losing.

2073
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:04,350
Kazuha.

2074
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:05,600
Come with me!

2075
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:06,180
Ah ?!

2076
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:07,470
What's happening?

2077
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,520
What's this? Is that a secret?

2078
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:11,940
Really?

2079
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:15,150
Yeah right, because I'm going to take "shinoburedo".

2080
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,980
So you really chose that poem as your favorite card?

2081
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:23,160
No, not because of the poem, but the name of the poet!

2082
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:26,330
Taira no Kanemori, the only poet among all poets of Hyakunin Isshu...

2083
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:29,870
平 兼 盛 - Taira no Kanemori 平 次
- Heiji

2084
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,620
... who owns Kanji "Hey" as in Heiji in his name.

2085
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:32,580
So that's where I can see it as a Heiji card.

2086
01:49:34,030 --> 01:49:36,960
After that, I send it to Heiji picture "shinoburedo"!

2087
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:39,340
"That's what I feel".

2088
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:43,550
You sent a "shinoburedo" card to express your feelings?

2089
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:45,850
Is not that against the rules?

2090
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:47,180
Momiji!

2091
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:49,270
Did you hear what we were talking about ?!

2092
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,060
You're not the only one who has a sharp hearing.

2093
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:53,770
Oh, Momiji!

2094
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:55,770
What are you doing here?

2095
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:58,570
I came to express my love as promised.

2096
01:49:59,310 --> 01:50:02,780
Because Heiji did not say it first.

2097
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:04,610
Huh? What are you talking about?

2098
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:07,280
This photo is the proof!

2099
01:50:08,150 --> 01:50:09,200
The promise of the little finger.

2100
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,500
Which means that they promise something to each other.

2101
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:14,710
If you break the agreement, you must stab the eye with a needle!

2102
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:17,590
Wait a minute! What did I promise?

2103
01:50:17,870 --> 01:50:21,460
condo attara, yome ni
toru sakai Yome: Wife

2104
01:50:17,950 --> 01:50:20,630
"Do not cry! I'll make you my wife when we meet again, so just wait."

2105
01:50:22,290 --> 01:50:25,260
This person has the ability to be captured while in the most embarrassing situations.

2106
01:50:26,130 --> 01:50:30,100
Or will you pretend that it never happened?

2107
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:32,850
Ah, I remember now!

2108
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:34,480
What I said then is...

2109
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:37,940
"Do not cry, let's fight back someday!"

2110
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:42,780
condo attara, motto Tsuyome ni
toru sakai Tsuyume: Stronger

2111
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:42,740
"But at the next meeting, I will also get stronger, so grasp your skills and wait for me!"

2112
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:46,950
Tsu...

2113
01:50:44,190 --> 01:50:46,950
Yome ni...

2114
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:46,950
Toru sakai!

2115
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:52,870
Because my opponent is a girl, I realize I can not hurt her.

2116
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:55,210
Iori, we're leaving now!

2117
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:56,670
Good, young lady!

2118
01:50:57,370 --> 01:51:00,340
Anyhow, I'm leaving now!

2119
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:03,670
Once I point my gaze at a card, I will not let anyone take it from me!

2120
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:06,340
You remember that's fine!

2121
01:51:07,790 --> 01:51:08,470
Kazuha!

2122
01:51:12,050 --> 01:51:14,980
What? Does he want a re-match, Kazuha?

2123
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:23,280
Sorry, are you sleeping?

2124
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:26,070
Sonoko, you know Hyakunin Isshu well, right?

2125
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,820
Well, I play it with my family every new year.

2126
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:32,660
I sent a meguri aite card to Shinichi.

2127
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:35,120
And reply by sending me a card se wo hayami, but...

2128
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:38,580
... I forgot what it means.

2129
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:41,710
"Even though I'm separated from a very valuable person...

2130
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:43,670
... someday we must meet again!"

2131
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:48,130
It is a love poem written by Sutoku In! Basic is in love.

2132
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:50,090
Ah! Wait, Sonoko!

2133
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,850
You should not forget such a thing, right ?!

2134
01:51:55,050 --> 01:51:59,240
