2
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,220
Master Kaecilius.

3
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,190
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

4
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,390
Hypocrite!

5
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,140
Challenge round, Billy.

6
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,280
Oh, come on, Billy, you've got
to be messing with me.

7
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,720
No, doctor.

8
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,810
<i>Feels So Good,</i> Chuck Mangione, 1977.

9
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,600
Honestly, Billy, you said
this one would be hard.

10
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,680
- Ha! It's 1978.
- No, Billy.

11
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,360
While <i>Feels So Good</i>
may have charted in 1978...

12
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,900
the album was released
in December of 1977.

13
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,660
No. Wikipedia says it's a nineteen...

14
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,780
Check again.

15
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,090
Where do you store

16
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,210
all this useless information?

17
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Useless?

18
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,250
The man charted a top 10 hit
with a flugelhorn.

19
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,080
Status, Billy?

20
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
1977.

21
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,850
- Oh, please.
- I hate you.

22
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,920
Oh!

23
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,920
Feels so good, doesn't it?

24
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,090
Oh, I got this, Stephen.

25
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,050
You've done your bit.
Go ahead. We'll close up.

26
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,130
What is it?

27
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,390
GSW.

28
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,000
It's amazing you kept him alive.

29
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,620
Apneic, failed the brain stem test...

30
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,060
and the apnea reflex test.

31
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,780
I think I found the problem,
Doctor Palmer.

32
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,520
You left a bullet in his head.

33
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,370
Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

34
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,820
I needed a specialist.
Nic diagnosed brain death.

35
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,700
Something about that
doesn't feel right to me.

36
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,730
We have to run.

37
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Doctor West.

38
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,780
What are you doing? Hey.

39
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,280
Organ harvest. He's a donor.

40
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,130
Slow down. I did not agree to that.

41
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,140
I don't need you to.
We've already called brain death.

42
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,260
Prematurely.
We need to get him prepped

43
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,450
for sub-occipital craniotomy.

44
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,250
Not gonna let you operate
on a dead man.

45
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,790
What do you see?

46
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,840
- A bullet?
- A perfect bullet.

47
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,890
It's been hardened. You harden a bullet
by alloying lead with antimony.

48
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,600
A toxic metal. And that's leeched
directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

49
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,440
Rapid onset central
nervous system shutdown.

50
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,470
We gotta go.

51
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,110
The patient's not dead, but he is dying.

52
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,560
Still want to harvest his organs?

53
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,200
- I'll assist you.
- No.

54
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,100
Doctor Palmer will assist me.

55
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,920
Thank you.

56
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,170
Image guidance, stat.

57
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,840
We don't have time for that.

58
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,630
You can't do it freehand.

59
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,970
I can and I will.

60
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,900
This isn't a time
for showing off, Strange.

61
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,140
How about 10 minutes ago

62
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,810
when you called
the wrong time of death?

63
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,370
<i>Cranial nerves intact.</i>

64
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,680
Doctor West, cover your watch.

65
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,070
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

66
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,660
I didn't have to save his patient, either.

67
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,400
But I sometimes just can't help myself.

68
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,850
Nic is a great doctor.

69
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,110
You came to me.

70
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,620
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

71
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,740
You had a second opinion.

72
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,260
What you needed was a competent one.

73
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,410
Well, all the more reason

74
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,590
why you should be
my neurosurgeon on call.

75
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,080
You could make such a difference.

76
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,750
I can't work in your butcher shop.

77
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,910
Hey!

78
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,130
I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

79
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,390
I'm stimulating neurogenesis
in the central nervous system.

80
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,760
The work I'm doing is gonna save
thousands for years to come.

81
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,210
In ER, you get to save
one drunk idiot with a gun.

82
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,340
Yeah, you're right.

83
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,880
In ER, we're only saving lives.

84
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,760
There's no fame, there's no, uh,

85
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,510
CNN interviews.

86
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,460
I guess I'll just have to stick with Nic.

87
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,600
Whoa, wait a minute.

88
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,950
You're not... You guys aren't...

89
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,260
What?

90
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,100
Sleeping together? Sorry, I thought
that was implicit in my disgust.

91
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,730
Explicit, actually.

92
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,060
No, I have a very strict rule
against dating colleagues.

93
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
Oh, really?

94
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,370
I call it the "Strange Policy."

95
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,940
Oh, well, good, I'm glad
something's named after me.

96
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,370
I invented a laminectomy procedure.

97
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,340
And yet, somehow no one seems to want
to call it the "Strange Technique."

98
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,860
We invented that technique.

99
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,450
Regardless, I'm very flattered
by your policy.

100
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,790
I'm talking tonight
at a Neurological Society dinner.

101
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,210
Come with me.

102
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,090
Another speaking engagement?

103
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,170
So romantic.

104
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,230
You used to love coming
to those things with me.

105
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,530
We had fun together.

106
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,260
No! You had fun.

107
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,140
They weren't about us,
they were about you.

108
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,300
Not only about me.

109
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,390
Stephen. Everything is about you.

110
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,890
Maybe we could hyphenate.

111
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,060
Strange-Palmer Technique.

112
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,020
Palmer-Strange.

113
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,360
Billy.

114
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,700
What have you got for me?

115
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,420
<i>I've got a 35-year-old
Air Force Colonel...</i>

116
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,320
<i>crushed his lower spine
in some kind of experimental armor.</i>

117
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,780
<i>Mid-thoracic burst fracture.</i>

118
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,330
Yeah, well, I could help...

119
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,740
but so could 50 other people.

120
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,250
Find me something worth my time.

121
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,710
<i>I have a 68-year-old female
with an advanced brain stem glioma.</i>

122
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,540
Yeah, you want me to screw up
my perfect record?

123
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,090
Definitely not.

124
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,490
<i>How about a 22-year-old female...</i>

125
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,820
<i>with an electronic implant in her brain
to control schizophrenia...</i>

126
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,060
<i>struck by lightning?</i>

127
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,680
Mmm. That does sound interesting.

128
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,980
Can you send me the...

129
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,900
Got it.

130
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Hey.

131
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,500
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

132
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,520
What did they do?

133
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,990
They rushed you in a chopper.

134
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,160
But it took a little while to find you.

135
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,400
The golden hours for nerve damage
went by while you were in the car.

136
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,160
What did they do?

137
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,030
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

138
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,090
Multiple torn ligaments...

139
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,260
severe nerve damage in both hands.

140
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,760
You were on the table for 11 hours.

141
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,760
Look at these fixators.

142
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,350
No one could have done better.

143
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,690
I could have done better.

144
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
No.

145
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,050
Give your body time to heal.

146
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,470
You've ruined me.

147
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,030
How long until I can take...

148
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,200
Doctor Strange.

149
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,850
Those tissues are still healing.

150
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,980
So, speed it up.

151
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,820
Pass a stent down the brachial artery
into the radial artery.

152
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
It's possible.

153
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,950
Experimental and expensive,
but possible.

154
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,950
All I need is possible.

155
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,510
<i>Up.</i>

156
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,970
Up.

157
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,470
Show me your strength.

158
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,280
This is useless.

159
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,530
It's not useless, man. You can do this.

160
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,040
All right, answer me this,
bachelor's degree.

161
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,780
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage

162
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,460
this severe to do this...

163
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,790
and actually recover?

164
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,420
One guy, yeah.

165
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,960
Factory accident, broke his back...

166
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,460
paralyzed, his leg wasted away.

167
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,850
He had pain in his shoulder,

168
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
from the wheelchair.

169
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,510
He came in three times a week.

170
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,870
Then one day he stopped coming.

171
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,890
I thought he was dead.

172
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,060
A few years later, he walked
past me on the street.

173
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,700
- Walked?
- Yeah, walked.

174
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,600
Bullshit.
Show me his file.

175
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,400
It'll take me a while to
pull the files from the archive.

176
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,900
But if it proves
your arrogant ass wrong...

177
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,650
Worth it.

178
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,590
<i>I looked
at all your research...</i>

179
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,880
<i>I read all the papers you've sent.</i>

180
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,760
<i>It's not gonna work.</i>

181
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,480
<i>I don't think you realize...</i>

182
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,010
<i>- how severe the damages are.</i>
- Here's the thing...

183
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,330
<i>The best have tried and failed.</i>

184
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,100
I understand. Here's the thing.

185
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,310
<i>What you want from me
is impossible, Stephen.</i>

186
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Come on.

187
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,520
<i>I've got my own reputation to consider.</i>

188
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,400
- Etienne, wait. No.
<i>- I can't help you.</i>

189
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,000
No, no, wait!

190
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,940
Hey!

191
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,910
He won't do it.

192
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,880
He's a hack.

193
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,540
There is a new procedure in Tokyo.

194
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,130
They culture donor stem cells...

195
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,430
and then harvesting them

196
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,970
and then 3D printing a scaffold.

197
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,270
If I could get a loan together...

198
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,300
Stephen.

199
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,010
A small loan, just $200,000.

200
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,240
You've always spent money
as fast as you could make it...

201
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,310
but now you're spending money
you don't even have.

202
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,100
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

203
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,560
No, now is exactly the time not to stop...

204
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,400
because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

205
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,400
But this isn't medicine anymore.

206
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,240
This is mania.

207
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,990
Some things just can't be fixed.

208
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,610
- Life without my work...
- Is still life.

209
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
This isn't the end.

210
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,790
There are other things that
can give your life meaning.

211
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,670
Like what? Like you?

212
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,420
This is the part where you apologize.

213
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,380
This is the part where you leave.

214
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,930
Fine, I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

215
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,530
Oh, too difficult for you, is it?

216
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
Yes, it is.

217
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,930
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

218
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,180
- No, don't pity me.
- I'm not pitying you.

219
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,660
Oh, yeah?
Then what are you doing here...

220
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,990
bringing cheese and wine
like we're old friends going for a picnic?

221
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,270
We are not friends, Christine.

222
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,690
We were barely lovers.

223
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,610
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

224
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,070
Is that what I am to you now?

225
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,820
"Poor Stephen Strange, charity case."

226
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,030
"He finally needs me."

227
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,830
Another dreg of humanity
for you to work on.

228
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,280
Patch him up and send him
back into the world...

229
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,870
heart's just humming.

230
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,290
You care so much, don't you?

231
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,790
Goodbye, Stephen.

232
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,610
All the way. Here we go.

233
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,600
Let's go! All day! All day!

234
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Yeah! All day.

235
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,370
Come on, man!
Where's the competition?

236
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,530
Talk a lot.

237
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,960
Jonathan Pangborn...

238
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,900
C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.

239
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,620
Who are you?

240
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,920
Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

241
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,490
Partial paralysis in both hands.

242
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,710
- I don't know you.
- I'm Stephen Strange.

243
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,880
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Was a neurosurgeon.

244
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,580
Actually, you know what, man,
I do know you.

245
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,470
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

246
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,050
I never got past your assistant.

247
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,220
You were untreatable.

248
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,720
No glory for you in that, right?

249
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,970
You came back from a place
there's no way back from.

250
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,640
I'm trying to
find my own way back.

251
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,660
Pangborn, are you in or you out?

252
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,250
All right.

253
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,540
I'd given up on my body.

254
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,000
I thought my mind's
the only thing I have left...

255
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,960
I should at least try to elevate that.

256
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,580
So, I sat with gurus...

257
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,380
and sacred women.

258
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,420
Strangers carried me to
mountaintops to see holy men.

259
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,590
And finally...

260
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,430
I found my teacher.

261
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,100
And my mind was elevated...

262
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,430
and my spirit deepened.

263
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,390
And somehow...

264
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
Your body healed.

265
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,770
Yes.

266
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,400
There were deeper secrets
to learn there...

267
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,380
but I didn't have the strength
to receive them.

268
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,200
I chose to settle for my miracle
and I came back home.

269
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,670
The place you're looking for
is called Kamar-Taj.

270
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,080
But the cost there is high.

271
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,080
How much?

272
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,840
I'm not talking about money.

273
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,300
Good luck.

274
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,590
Let's ball. All right, ball up!

275
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,830
Uh, Kamar-Taj?

276
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,570
You know where Kamar-Taj is?

277
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,020
Kamar-Taj?

278
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,860
Kamar-Taj.

279
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,430
Okay.

280
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,050
Look, guys, I don't have any money.

281
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,810
Your watch.

282
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,100
No, please. It's all I have left.

283
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,310
Your watch.

284
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,900
All right.

285
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,280
You're looking for Kamar-Taj.

286
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,140
Really?

287
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,230
Sure we got the right place?

288
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,480
That one looks
a little more Kamar-Tajey.

289
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,030
I once stood in your place.

290
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,620
And I, too, was disrespectful.

291
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,990
So, might I offer you some advice?

292
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,370
Forget everything you think you know.

293
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,380
All right.

294
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,970
The sanctuary of our teacher.

295
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,180
The Ancient One.

296
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,140
The Ancient One?

297
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,350
What's his real name?

298
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,060
Right.

299
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,690
Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.

300
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,240
Um, thank you for... Whoa!

301
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,580
Okay, that's a thing.

302
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,870
Thank you for...

303
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Hello.

304
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,420
Oh, thank you.

305
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,380
And thank you.

306
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,510
Uh, thank you...

307
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,390
Ancient One, for seeing me.

308
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,550
You're very welcome.

309
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,270
The Ancient One.

310
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,270
Thank you, Master Mordo.
Thank you, Master Hamir.

311
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,020
Mr. Strange.

312
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,270
Uh... Doctor, actually.

313
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,900
Well, no, not anymore, surely.

314
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,160
Isn't that why you're here?

315
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,740
You've undergone many procedures.

316
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,160
- Seven, right?
- Yeah.

317
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,910
It's good tea.

318
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
Yes.

319
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,250
Did you heal a man named Pangborn?

320
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,460
A paralyzed man?

321
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,630
In a way.

322
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,710
You helped him to walk again.

323
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,920
Yes.

324
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,640
How did you correct a complete
C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

325
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,600
Well, I didn't correct it.

326
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,060
He couldn't walk.

327
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,560
I convinced him that he could.

328
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,650
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

329
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,690
When you reattach a severed nerve...

330
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,230
is it you who heals it
back together or the body?

331
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,310
It's the cells.

332
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,980
The cells are only programmed...

333
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,180
to put themselves back together
in very specific ways.

334
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,230
Right.

335
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,780
What if I told you that
your own body could be convinced...

336
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,110
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

337
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,290
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

338
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,620
That's bleeding edge medical tech.

339
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,630
Is that why you're working here?

340
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,000
Without a governing medical board?

341
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,050
Just how experimental
is your treatment?

342
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,130
Quite.

343
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,930
So, you've figured out a way...

344
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,300
to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

345
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,850
No, Mr. Strange.

346
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,350
I know how to reorient the spirit...

347
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,140
to better heal the body.

348
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,650
- The spirit to heal the body?
- That's right.

349
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,780
No. All right.

350
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,940
How do we do that?

351
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,620
Where do we start?

352
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,130
- Don't like that map?
- Oh, no.

353
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,380
It's really good. It's just,
I've seen it before...

354
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,750
in gift shops.

355
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,880
And what about this one?

356
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,510
- Acupuncture, great.
- Yeah?

357
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,640
What about that one?

358
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,510
Showing me an MRI scan.
I do not believe this.

359
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,190
Each of those maps
was drawn up by someone...

360
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,970
who could see in part, but not the whole.

361
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,540
I spent my last dollar getting here,
one-way ticket...

362
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,780
and you're talking to me
about healing through belief?

363
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,370
You're a man looking at the world
through a keyhole.

364
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,210
You've spent your whole life

365
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,380
trying to widen that keyhole...

366
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,030
to see more, to know more.

367
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,210
Now, on hearing that it can be widened...

368
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,210
in ways you can't imagine...

369
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,870
you reject the possibility.

370
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,510
No, I reject it because
I do not believe in fairy tales...

371
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,210
about chakras or energy...

372
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,960
or the power of belief.

373
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,130
There is no such thing as spirit!

374
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,760
We are made of matter
and nothing more.

375
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,100
You're just another tiny,
momentary speck

376
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,510
within an indifferent universe.

377
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,220
You think too little of yourself.

378
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,440
Oh, you think
you see through me, do you?

379
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,610
Well, you don't.

380
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,560
But I see through you!

381
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,670
What did you just do to me?

382
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,920
I pushed your astral form
out of your physical form.

383
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,640
What's in that tea?

384
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,430
Psilocybin? LSD?

385
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,210
It's just tea...

386
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,340
with a little honey.

387
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,140
What just happened?

388
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,640
For a moment, you entered
the astral dimension.

389
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
The what?

390
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,850
A place where the soul exists
apart from the body.

391
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,850
Why are you doing this to me?

392
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,440
To show you
just how much you don't know.

393
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,570
Open your eye.

394
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,900
Oh, shit!

395
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,450
Oh, God! Oh, God, no!

396
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,990
No, no, no!

397
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
What's happening?

398
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,420
This isn't real!

399
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,970
<i>His heart rate
is getting dangerously high.</i>

400
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,310
He looks all right to me.

401
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,650
<i>You think
you know how the world works?</i>

402
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:46,030
<i>You think that this material universe
is all there is?</i>

403
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,830
<i>What is real?</i>

404
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,540
<i>What mysteries lie beyond
the reach of your senses?</i>

405
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,050
<i>At the root of existence...</i>

406
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,300
<i>mind and matter meet.</i>

407
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,340
<i>Thoughts shape reality.</i>

408
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,720
Oh!

409
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,940
<i>This universe is only one
of an infinite number.</i>

410
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,690
<i>Worlds without end.</i>

411
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,900
<i>Some benevolent and life giving.</i>

412
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,540
<i>Others filled with malice and hunger.</i>

413
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,410
<i>Dark places...</i>

414
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,380
<i>where powers older than time
lie ravenous...</i>

415
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,300
<i>and waiting.</i>

416
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:05,150
<i>Who are you
in this vast Multiverse, Mr. Strange?</i>

417
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,330
Have you seen
that before in a gift shop?

418
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,550
Teach me.

419
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,310
No.

420
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,150
No.

421
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,230
No!

422
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,440
No, no, no!

423
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,700
No!

424
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,070
Open the door! Please!

425
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,620
Thank you, Masters.

426
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,090
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

427
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,540
5 hours later,
he's still on your doorstep.

428
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,340
There's a strength to him.

429
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,130
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.

430
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,890
I've seen it all before.

431
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,100
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

432
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,020
I cannot lead another
gifted student to power...

433
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,350
only to lose him to the darkness.

434
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,810
You didn't lose me.

435
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,480
I wanted the power
to defeat my enemies.

436
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,190
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

437
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,240
And to live within the natural law.

438
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,540
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

439
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,660
We only learn to live above them.

440
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,120
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

441
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,580
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin...

442
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,090
upon us all.

443
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,930
There may be dark days ahead.

444
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,800
Perhaps Kamar-Taj
could use a man like Strange.

445
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,730
Don't shut me out.

446
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,610
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

447
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,530
Thank you.

448
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,920
Bathe.

449
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,250
Rest.

450
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,580
Meditate...

451
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,590
if you can.

452
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,800
The Ancient One will send for you.

453
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,890
What's this? My mantra?

454
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,230
The Wi-Fi password.

455
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,440
We're not savages.

456
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,930
<i>The language
of the mystic arts...</i>

457
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,600
<i>is as old as civilization.</i>

458
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,140
The sorcerers of antiquity...

459
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,110
called the use of this language "spells."

460
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,330
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities...

461
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,860
you can call it a "program."

462
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,040
The source code that shapes reality.

463
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,990
We harness energy...

464
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,620
drawn from other dimensions
of the Multiverse...

465
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,710
to cast spells...

466
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,930
to conjure shields...

467
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,970
and weapons...

468
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,140
to make magic.

469
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,030
But even if my fingers could do that...

470
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,780
my hands would just be
waving in the air.

471
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,030
How do I get from here to there?

472
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,670
How did you get
to reattach severed nerves...

473
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,340
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

474
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,920
Study and practice, years of it.

475
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,510
Hey.

476
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,560
Mr. Strange.

477
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,600
Uh, Stephen, please.

478
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,850
- And you are?
- Wong.

479
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,190
Wong.

480
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,100
Just Wong?

481
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,940
Like Adele?

482
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,520
Or Aristotle.

483
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,280
Drake.

484
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:08,740
Bono.

485
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Eminem.

486
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,460
<i>The Book of the Invisible Sun.</i>

487
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,870
<i>Astronomia Nova.</i>

488
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,590
<i>Codex Imperium.</i>

489
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,590
<i>Key of Solomon.</i>

490
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,180
You finished all of these?

491
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,510
Yup.

492
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,260
Come with me.

493
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,480
All right.

494
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,430
This section
is for masters only...

495
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,980
but at my discretion, others may use it.

496
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,570
You should start with Maxim's Primer.

497
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,980
How's your Sanskrit?

498
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,070
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

499
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,950
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

500
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,950
What are those?

501
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,710
The Ancient One's
private collection.

502
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,090
So, they're forbidden?

503
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,760
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj
is forbidden.

504
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,720
Only certain practices.

505
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,550
Those books are far too advanced

506
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,730
for anyone other than
the Sorcerer Supreme.

507
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,780
This one's got pages missing.

508
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,240
That's <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

509
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,070
A study of time.

510
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,030
One of the rituals was stolen
by a former master.

511
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,830
The Zealot, Kaecilius.

512
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,870
Just after he strung up
the former librarian...

513
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,460
and relieved him of his head.

514
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,000
I am now the guardian of these books.

515
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,800
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again...

516
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,310
I'd know it...

517
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,680
and you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

518
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,480
What if it's just overdue?

519
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,850
Any late fees I should know about?
Maiming, perhaps?

520
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,490
People used to think that I was funny.

521
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,870
Did they work for you?

522
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,160
All right. Well, it's been
lovely talking to you.

523
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,080
Thank you for the books...

524
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,380
and for the horrifying story...

525
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,300
and for the threat upon my life.

526
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,370
We will now receive the power

527
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,360
to destroy the one who betrayed us.

528
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,040
The one who betrays the world.

529
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,230
Mastery of the sling ring
is essential to the mystic arts.

530
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,890
They allow us to travel
throughout the Multiverse.

531
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,440
All you need to do is focus.

532
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,490
Visualize.

533
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,910
See the destination in your mind.

534
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,080
Look beyond the world in front of you.

535
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,080
Imagine every detail.

536
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:27,340
The clearer the picture,
the quicker and easier...

537
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,800
the gateway will come.

538
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,550
And stop.

539
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,260
I would like a moment alone
with Mr. Strange.

540
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,060
Of course.

541
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,470
My hands.

542
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,730
It's not about your hands.

543
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,940
How is this not about my hands?

544
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Master Hamir.

545
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,410
Thank you, Master Hamir.

546
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,550
You cannot beat a river into submission.

547
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,590
You have to surrender to its current...

548
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,000
and use its power as your own.

549
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,340
I control it by surrendering control?

550
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,840
That doesn't make any sense.

551
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,390
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

552
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,640
Your intellect has
taken you far in life...

553
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,270
but it will take you no further.

554
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
Surrender, Stephen.

555
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,970
Silence your ego...

556
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,140
and your power will rise.

557
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,200
Come with me.

558
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,410
Wait.

559
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,450
- Is this...
- Everest.

560
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,130
Beautiful.

561
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,710
Yeah, right, beautiful.

562
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,290
Freezing but beautiful.

563
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,810
At this temperature...

564
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,960
a person can last for 30 minutes...

565
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,630
before suffering permanent
loss of function.

566
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Great.

567
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,430
But you'll likely go into shock
within the first two.

568
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,840
- What?
- Surrender, Stephen.

569
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,060
No!

570
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,050
How's our new recruit?

571
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,190
We shall see.

572
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,700
Any second now.

573
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,080
Oh, no, not again.

574
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,410
Maybe I should...

575
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:45,660
Stephen.

576
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,900
Wong.

577
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,010
What do you want, Strange?

578
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,450
Books on astral projection.

579
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,540
You're not ready for that.

580
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,960
Try me, Beyoncé.

581
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,420
Oh, come on. You've heard of her.

582
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,880
She's a huge star, right?

583
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,840
Do you ever laugh?

584
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,720
Oh, come on, just give me the book.

585
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,850
No.

586
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,950
<i>Once, in this room,</i>

587
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,380
<i>you begged me to let you learn.</i>

588
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,380
Now, I'm told
you question every lesson...

589
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,050
preferring to teach yourself.

590
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,110
Once, in this room,
you told me to open my eye.

591
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,050
Now, I'm being told
to blindly accept rules...

592
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,550
that make no sense.

593
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,680
Like the rule against
conjuring a gateway in the library?

594
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:55,310
Wong told on me?

595
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,980
You're advancing quickly
with your sorcery skills.

596
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,730
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

597
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,210
You are now inside
the Mirror Dimension...

598
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,040
ever present but undetected.

599
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,250
The real world isn't affected
by what happens here.

600
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:31,390
We use the Mirror Dimension
to train, surveil...

601
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,520
and sometimes to contain threats.

602
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,830
You don't wanna be stuck in here
without your sling ring.

603
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,650
Hold on. Sorry.
What do you mean, "threats?"

604
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:53,410
Learning of an infinite Multiverse
includes learning of infinite dangers.

605
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,710
If I told you everything else
that you don't already know...

606
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,330
you'd run from here in terror.

607
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,800
So just how ancient is she?

608
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,510
No one knows the age
of the Sorcerer Supreme.

609
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,470
Only that she's Celtic
and never talks about her past.

610
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,480
You follow her, even though
you don't know?

611
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,600
I know she's steadfast...

612
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,230
but unpredictable.

613
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:21,690
Merciless, yet kind.

614
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,320
She made me what I am.

615
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,320
Trust your teacher...

616
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,200
and don't lose your way.

617
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,480
Like Kaecilius?

618
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:32,900
That's right.

619
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,870
You knew him.

620
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,200
When he first came to us...

621
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,500
he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

622
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:47,500
He was a grieving, broken man
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

623
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:51,510
A brilliant student,
but he was proud, headstrong.

624
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:53,670
He questioned the Ancient One,
rejected her teaching.

625
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,110
He left Kamar-Taj.

626
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,730
His disciples followed him like sheep.

627
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,780
Seduced by false doctrine.

628
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:10,280
And he stole the forbidden ritual, right?

629
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,360
Yes.

630
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,700
What did it do?

631
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,370
No more questions.

632
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,960
What's that?

633
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,280
That's a question.

634
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,880
This is a relic.

635
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,880
Some magic is too powerful to sustain...

636
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,240
so we imbue objects with it...

637
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,510
allowing them
to take the strain we cannot.

638
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:33,550
This is the staff...

639
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,350
of the Living Tribunal.

640
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,260
There are many relics.

641
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,230
The Wand of Watoomb.

642
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,850
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

643
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,850
Really just roll off
the tongue, don't they?

644
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:49,610
- When do I get my relic?
- When you're ready.

645
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,070
I think I'm ready.

646
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,910
You're ready when the relic
decides you're ready.

647
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:55,820
For now...

648
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,820
conjure a weapon.

649
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:00,570
All right.

650
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,090
Fight!

651
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,720
Fight like your life depended on it.

652
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,300
Because one day...

653
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:19,810
it may.

654
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,160
Wong?

655
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,840
Okay.

656
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:49,060
"First, open the Eye of Agamotto."

657
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,460
All right.

658
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,110
Oh, my.

659
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,750
What if...

660
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,020
"Dormammu."

661
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:16,940
"The Dark Dimension."

662
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,360
Eternal life?

663
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,660
- What the...
- Stop!

664
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,120
Tampering with continuum probabilities
is forbidden.

665
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:35,750
I was just doing
exactly what it said in the book.

666
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,160
What did the book say

667
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,810
about the dangers
of performing that ritual?

668
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,480
I don't know.
I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

669
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,510
Temporal manipulations
can create branches in time.

670
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,920
Unstable dimensional openings.

671
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:48,310
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!

672
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,440
You wanna get stuck
reliving the same moment

673
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,810
over and over forever...

674
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:53,230
or never having existed at all?

675
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,890
Really should put the warnings
before the spell.

676
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,940
Your curiosity could have
gotten you killed.

677
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,360
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continuum...

678
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,440
you were breaking it.

679
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,830
We do not tamper with natural law.

680
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,900
We defend it.

681
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,450
How did you even do that?

682
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,830
Hmm?

683
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,990
Where did you learn the litany of spells
required to even understand it?

684
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,300
I've got a photographic memory.

685
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,370
That's how I got my M.D.
and Ph.D. at the same time.

686
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:17,830
What you just did...

687
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,250
takes more than a good memory.

688
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,260
You were born for the mystic arts.

689
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:24,510
And yet my hands still shake.

690
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,880
For now, yes.

691
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,180
Not forever?

692
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,470
We're not prophets.

693
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,550
When are you gonna start
telling me what we are?

694
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,440
While heroes like the Avengers

695
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,810
protect the world
from physical dangers...

696
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,360
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

697
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,910
The Ancient One
is the latest in a long line

698
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,150
of Sorcerers Supreme...

699
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:52,040
going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts...

700
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,320
the mighty Agamotto.

701
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:58,460
Same sorcerer who created the eye
you so recklessly borrowed.

702
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,460
Agamotto built three Sanctums
in places of power...

703
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,640
where great cities now stand.

704
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:07,880
That door leads to
the Hong Kong Sanctum.

705
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,510
That door to the New York Sanctum.

706
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,460
That one to the London Sanctum.

707
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,600
Together...

708
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,310
the Sanctums generate
a protective shield around our world.

709
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,480
The Sanctums
protect the world...

710
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,900
and we sorcerers...

711
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,810
protect the Sanctums.

712
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,940
From what?

713
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:28,730
Other dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

714
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,570
Like Dormammu.

715
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,450
Where did you learn that name?

716
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,330
I just read it in
<i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i> Why?

717
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,090
Dormammu dwells
in the Dark Dimension.

718
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,250
Beyond time.

719
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,090
He is the cosmic conqueror...

720
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,100
the destroyer of worlds.

721
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,940
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger...

722
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:58,430
on a quest to invade every universe...

723
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:01,230
and bring all worlds
into his Dark Dimension.

724
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,110
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

725
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,450
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

726
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,040
A ritual to contact Dormammu

727
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:12,630
and draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

728
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,660
Uh... Okay...

729
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,250
Um... I'm out.

730
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,620
I came here
to heal my hands.

731
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:28,670
Not to fight in some mystical war.

732
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,970
London.

733
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,800
Kaecilius!

734
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,100
No!

735
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,200
Wong? Mordo?

736
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,200
Hello?

737
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,560
Hello?

738
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:51,900
Daniel, I see they made you
master of this Sanctum.

739
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,110
You know what that means?

740
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,280
That you'll die protecting it.

741
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:14,510
Stop!

742
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:28,190
How long have you been
at Kamar-Taj, Mister...

743
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:29,600
Doctor.

744
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,060
Mister Doctor?

745
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,150
It's Strange.

746
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:38,150
Maybe. Who am I to judge?

747
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,630
Ha!

748
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,260
You don't know how to use that, do you?

749
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,430
Uh...

750
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,870
What?

751
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:58,250
Oh, stop it.

752
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:59,370
I said stop it.

753
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,020
You cannot stop this, Mister Doctor.

754
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,550
I don't even know what "this" is.

755
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:04,750
It's the end...

756
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,760
and the beginning.

757
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,670
The many becoming the few
becoming the One.

758
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,900
If you're not gonna start making sense...

759
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,740
I'm just gonna to have to
put this thing back on.

760
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,810
Tell me, Mister Doctor...

761
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:19,270
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange.

762
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,100
- You are a doctor?
- Yeah.

763
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,270
A scientist.

764
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:24,440
You understand the laws of nature.

765
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:27,900
All things age. All things die.

766
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,530
In the end, our sun burns out.

767
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:31,860
Our universe grows cold and perishes.

768
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:33,740
But the Dark Dimension...

769
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,580
it's a place beyond time.

770
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,380
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.

771
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:39,970
This world doesn't have to die, doctor.

772
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,680
This world can take its rightful place
alongside so many others...

773
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:44,080
as part of the One.

774
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,630
The great and beautiful One.

775
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,140
We can all live forever.

776
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,630
Really?

777
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,890
What do you have to gain
out of this New Age dimensional utopia?

778
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,050
The same as you.

779
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:00,970
The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life.

780
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,480
People think in terms of good and evil...

781
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:05,490
when really time
is the true enemy of us all.

782
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,280
Time kills everything.

783
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,110
What about the people you killed?

784
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,490
Tiny.

785
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:13,030
Momentary specks within
an indifferent universe.

786
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:17,030
Yes. You see.

787
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,870
You see what we're doing.

788
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:22,240
The world is not what it ought to be.

789
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:24,830
Humanity longs for the eternal...

790
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:27,630
for a world beyond time,
because time is what enslaves us.

791
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:29,960
Time is an insult.

792
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,670
Death is an insult.

793
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:34,340
Doctor...

794
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,810
we don't seek to rule this world.

795
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,140
We seek to save it...

796
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,720
to hand it over to Dormammu,
who is the intent of all evolution...

797
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,570
the why of all existence.

798
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,480
The Sorcerer Supreme
defends existence.

799
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,280
What was it that brought you
to Kamar-Taj, doctor?

800
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:54,780
Was it enlightenment?

801
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:56,790
Power?

802
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:01,040
You came to be healed, as did we all.

803
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:05,370
Kamar-Taj is a place
that collects broken things.

804
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,460
We all come with the promise
of being healed...

805
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:10,380
and instead The Ancient One
gives us parlor tricks.

806
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:14,220
The real magic she keeps for herself.

807
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,640
You ever wonder
how she managed to live this long?

808
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:25,230
I saw the rituals
in <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

809
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,730
So, you know.

810
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,650
The ritual gives me the power

811
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,070
to overthrow The Ancient One...

812
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,900
and tear her Sanctums down.

813
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,660
To let the Dark Dimension in.

814
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:37,740
Because what The Ancient One hoards,

815
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:39,450
Dormammu gives freely.

816
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,780
Life everlasting.

817
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:44,920
He's not the destroyer of worlds, doctor.

818
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:46,920
He's the savior of worlds.

819
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,210
No. I mean, come on.

820
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:51,130
Look at your face.

821
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,680
Dormammu made you a murderer.

822
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,970
Just how good can his kingdom be?

823
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,470
You think that's funny?

824
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,600
No, not that.

825
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,180
What's funny is that
you've lost your sling ring.

826
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,630
Sir, can I help you?

827
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:14,920
Doctor Palmer, where is she?

828
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,640
- Sir. We need to get...
- Where is she?

829
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:18,170
The nurse's station.

830
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,350
Christine!

831
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,570
Stephen?

832
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:23,680
Oh, my God.

833
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,350
Get me in an operating theater now.
Just you.

834
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:27,550
Now! I haven't any time.

835
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,270
What happened?

836
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:32,320
I was stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

837
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:34,850
What are you wearing?

838
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,530
Chest cavity is clear.

839
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:45,320
No, the blood is in the pericardial sac.

840
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,460
No, no, no.

841
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:50,540
Stephen?

842
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,340
Come on, come on.

843
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,280
Just a little higher.

844
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:23,890
Please be careful with the needle.

845
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:26,820
Stephen?

846
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:30,580
What am I seeing?

847
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,620
My astral body.

848
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:34,910
Are you dead?

849
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:36,800
No, Christine. But I am dying.

850
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,880
Right.

851
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:43,340
Yeah. All right.

852
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:45,090
Okay.

853
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,350
Oh, wow.

854
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:56,820
I've never seen a wound like this.

855
01:07:57,350 --> 01:07:58,770
What were you stabbed with?

856
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:00,530
I don't know.

857
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,050
I'm gonna have to vanish now.

858
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:23,510
What?

859
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:25,130
Keep me alive, will you?

860
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,720
Huh?

861
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:30,260
Okay.

862
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:32,760
Uh-huh.

863
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:55,790
Oh, shit.

864
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:34,620
Come on, come on.

865
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,790
Stephen, come on.

866
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,920
Hit me again.

867
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,590
Stop doing that!

868
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,550
Up the voltage and hit me again.

869
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:49,680
No, your heart's beating!

870
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,090
Just do it!

871
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,590
Oh, my God.

872
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,670
Oh, God! Oh, God!

873
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:25,920
Are you okay?

874
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,090
Yeah.

875
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:28,290
Okay.

876
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,770
After all this time...

877
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:38,730
you just show up here...

878
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,360
flying out of your body.

879
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,240
Yeah, I know.

880
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:45,940
I missed you, too, by the way.

881
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:47,910
Ha ha.

882
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,610
I wrote you emails,
but you never responded.

883
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:51,940
Why would I?

884
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,160
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

885
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,080
For all of it. You were right.

886
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,880
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly.

887
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:04,380
And you deserved so much more.

888
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,000
Stop. You're clearly in shock.

889
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,260
What the hell is happening?

890
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,720
Where have you been?

891
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:15,800
Well, after Western medicine failed me...

892
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,850
I headed east,
and I ended up in Kathmandu.

893
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:20,140
Kathmandu?

894
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:21,480
Yeah.

895
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:23,650
Like the Bob Seger song?

896
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,730
1975, <i>Beautiful Loser,</i> side A. Yeah.

897
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:29,610
I went to a place called Kamar-Taj...

898
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:33,450
and I talked to someone
called "The Ancient One."

899
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:35,570
Oh. So you joined a cult.

900
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:38,250
No, I didn't. No, not exactly. No.

901
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:41,170
They did teach me to tap into powers
that I never even knew existed.

902
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,580
Yeah. That sounds like a cult.

903
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:44,000
It's not a cult.

904
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,720
Well, that's what a cultist would say.

905
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:46,750
Oh, no.

906
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:49,800
Wait. Stephen, wait.
What do you think you're doing?

907
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,670
I'm late for a cult meeting.

908
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:56,560
This is insane.

909
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:57,720
Yeah.

910
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,800
- Where are you going?
- Um...

911
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:01,770
Can you tell me the truth?

912
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:04,430
Well, a powerful sorcerer

913
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,280
who gave himself over
to an ancient entity...

914
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:08,940
can bend the very laws of physics,
tried very hard to kill me.

915
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,870
But I left him chained up
in Greenwich Village...

916
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,460
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway...

917
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,630
that I opened up in the mop closet.

918
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:16,530
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

919
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,670
Really do have to go.

920
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:30,840
Yeah.

921
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:17,710
Strange!

922
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:21,470
You're okay.

923
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,810
A relative term. But yeah, I'm okay.

924
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,350
The Cloak of Levitation.

925
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:28,860
It came to you.

926
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,060
No minor feat.

927
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,440
It's a fickle thing.

928
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:35,610
- He's escaped.
- Kaecilius?

929
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:36,900
Yeah.

930
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,700
He can fold space and matter at will.

931
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:43,320
He folds matter
outside the Mirror Dimension...

932
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:44,580
in the real world?

933
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:45,780
Yeah.

934
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:47,750
- How many more?
- Two.

935
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,840
I stranded one in the desert.

936
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:52,010
And the other?

937
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,550
His body's in the hall.

938
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:55,420
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

939
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:57,300
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

940
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,020
The London Sanctum has fallen.

941
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:01,300
Only New York and Hong Kong
remain now...

942
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:03,550
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

943
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:07,190
You defended the New York Sanctum
from attack.

944
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:09,180
With its master gone, it needs another.

945
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:10,850
Master Strange.

946
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:14,730
No.

947
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,940
It is Doctor Strange.

948
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,740
Not Master Strange. Not Mister Strange.

949
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:21,990
Doctor Strange.

950
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,870
When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

951
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:28,290
And I have just killed a man!

952
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:30,210
I'm not doing that again.

953
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:32,760
I became a doctor
to save lives, not take them.

954
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,170
You became a doctor
to save one life above all others.

955
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,250
Your own.

956
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,510
Still seeing through me, are you?

957
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:44,340
I see what I've always seen:
your over-inflated ego.

958
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,060
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything...

959
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,560
even death...

960
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,360
which no one can control.

961
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,190
Not even the great
Doctor Stephen Strange.

962
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,530
Not even Dormammu?

963
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:00,030
He offers immortality.

964
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:02,190
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

965
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:03,580
He feeds off it.

966
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:06,000
Like you feed off him?

967
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:07,920
You talk to me about controlling death?

968
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:09,080
Oh, I know how you do it.

969
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,960
I've seen the missing rituals
from <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

970
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,870
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

971
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,840
Because you might not like them?

972
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:20,970
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

973
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:22,710
What is he talking about?

974
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,180
I'm talking about her long life,
the source of her immortality.

975
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,600
She draws power
from the Dark Dimension

976
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:31,220
to stay alive.

977
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:34,310
That's not true.

978
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,690
I've seen the rituals. Worked them out.

979
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,980
I know how you do it.

980
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:42,110
Once they regroup...

981
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,860
the Zealots will be back.

982
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:46,410
You'll need reinforcements.

983
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:55,380
She's not who you think she is.

984
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:57,420
You don't have the right to say that.

985
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:00,260
You've no idea the responsibility
that rests upon her shoulders.

986
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:02,260
No, and I don't want to know.

987
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:03,720
You're a coward.

988
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:05,140
Because I'm not a killer?

989
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:06,900
These Zealots will snuff us all out...

990
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:09,560
and you can't muster the strength
to snuff them first?

991
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,240
What do you think I just did?

992
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,480
You saved your own life!

993
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:16,400
And then whined about it
like a wounded dog.

994
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,080
Oh, you would have done it so easily?

995
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,780
You've no idea the things I've done.

996
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,820
And the answer is yes.

997
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,620
Without hesitation.

998
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:27,980
Even if there's another way?

999
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,950
There is no other way.

1000
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:31,410
You lack imagination.

1001
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:32,580
No, Stephen.

1002
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:36,290
You lack a spine.

1003
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,630
They're back.

1004
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:50,730
We have to end this.

1005
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:52,020
Now!

1006
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:58,360
Strange!

1007
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,190
Get down here and fight!

1008
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:01,610
No!

1009
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:07,320
The Mirror Dimension.

1010
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:10,320
You can't affect the real world in here.

1011
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:12,120
Who's laughing now?

1012
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,450
Asshole.

1013
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,370
I am.

1014
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:31,690
I've got his sling ring.

1015
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,720
They can't escape, right?

1016
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,230
Run!

1017
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:54,090
Their connection
to the Dark Dimension

1018
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,040
makes them more powerful
in the Mirror Dimension.

1019
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,510
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

1020
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:01,380
This wasn't cleverness. It was suicide!

1021
01:18:17,970 --> 01:18:20,190
That is hilarious.

1022
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,150
This was a mistake.

1023
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,040
Whoa.

1024
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:12,590
Oh!

1025
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:41,740
It's true.

1026
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:46,040
She does draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

1027
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:50,590
Kaecilius.

1028
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:56,220
I came to you broken...

1029
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:59,220
lost, in need.

1030
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:02,220
Trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

1031
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,190
I tried to protect you.

1032
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:06,680
- From the truth?
- From yourself.

1033
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:09,060
I have a new teacher now.

1034
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:10,570
Dormammu deceives you.

1035
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,860
You have no idea what he truly is.

1036
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:17,910
His eternal life is not paradise,
but torment.

1037
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:19,290
Liar.

1038
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,130
Christine!

1039
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:18,550
Are you kidding me?

1040
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:20,710
Oh, my God.

1041
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:25,480
It's not fibrillation.
She has a stunned myocardium.

1042
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:26,750
- Neurogenic?
- Yes.

1043
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:32,980
Someone get the swabs.

1044
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,480
Nic?

1045
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:41,580
We need to relieve
the pressure on her brain.

1046
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:46,330
She's still dropping.

1047
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:47,450
We're losing her!

1048
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:48,790
We need to increase her oxygen!

1049
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:49,990
I need a crash cart!

1050
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,360
Her pupils have dilated!

1051
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:52,830
No reflexes.

1052
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:54,390
We're not reading any brain activity.

1053
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,480
What are you doing?

1054
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:10,180
Come on, you're dying!

1055
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:21,360
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

1056
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,160
Time is relative.

1057
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,530
Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

1058
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:29,250
I've spent so many years...

1059
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,040
peering through time...

1060
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,700
looking at this exact moment.

1061
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:35,410
But I can't see past it.

1062
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,630
I've prevented countless,
terrible futures.

1063
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:42,300
And after each one,
there's always another.

1064
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:44,760
And they all lead here...

1065
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:45,840
but never further.

1066
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,060
You think this is where you die.

1067
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:51,350
You wonder what I see in your future?

1068
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:52,560
No.

1069
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,940
Yes.

1070
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:57,570
I never saw your future.

1071
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:00,200
Only its possibilities.

1072
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:02,990
You have such a capacity for goodness.

1073
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:05,070
You always excelled...

1074
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:07,660
but not because you craved success...

1075
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:10,210
but because of your fear of failure.

1076
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,030
That's what made me a great doctor.

1077
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,840
It's precisely what kept you
from greatness.

1078
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,000
Arrogance and fear still keep you...

1079
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,460
from learning the simplest

1080
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:21,590
and most significant lesson of all.

1081
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:22,670
Which is?

1082
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,140
It's not about you.

1083
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:32,230
When you first came to me...

1084
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:35,480
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

1085
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,770
I didn't.

1086
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:43,940
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

1087
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:45,860
He uses magic to walk?

1088
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:47,120
Constantly.

1089
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:49,540
He had a choice...

1090
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,290
to return to his own life...

1091
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55,160
or to serve something
greater than himself.

1092
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,920
So I could have my hands back again?

1093
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,420
My old life?

1094
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,330
You could.

1095
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:05,220
And the world would be
all the lesser for it.

1096
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,100
I've hated drawing power
from the Dark Dimension.

1097
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:11,350
But as you well know...

1098
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:13,800
sometimes one must break the rules...

1099
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:15,690
in order to serve the greater good.

1100
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:17,850
Mordo won't see it that way.

1101
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:20,560
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable...

1102
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,860
forged by the fires of his youth.

1103
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,860
He needs your flexibility...

1104
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:26,990
just as you need his strength.

1105
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:31,790
Only together do you stand a chance
of stopping Dormammu.

1106
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:33,500
I'm not ready.

1107
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:37,000
No one ever is.

1108
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,840
We don't get to choose our time.

1109
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,180
Death is what gives life meaning.

1110
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,890
To know your days are numbered.

1111
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:53,010
Your time is short.

1112
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:57,270
You'd think after
all this time, I'd be ready.

1113
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,940
But look at me.

1114
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:03,020
Stretching one moment out
into a thousand...

1115
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:05,610
just so that I can watch the snow.

1116
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:45,780
Are you okay?

1117
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:55,700
I don't understand what's happening.

1118
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:56,960
I know.

1119
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:00,620
But I have to go away now.

1120
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:08,420
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end.

1121
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,180
That it could be a beginning.

1122
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:11,430
Yeah.

1123
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:15,640
Because there are other ways
to save lives.

1124
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,260
A harder way.

1125
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,770
A weirder way.

1126
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:26,770
<i>Doctor Palmer to the ER, please.</i>

1127
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:28,480
<i>Doctor Palmer to the ER.</i>

1128
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,620
I don't want you to go.

1129
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:23,870
Stop!

1130
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:55,780
Choose your weapon wisely.

1131
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:01,290
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

1132
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:04,580
No one.

1133
01:29:20,510 --> 01:29:21,730
Kaecilius.

1134
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:24,390
You're on the wrong side
of history, Wong.

1135
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:38,610
She's dead.

1136
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:39,910
You were right.

1137
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:43,160
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1138
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,080
She was complicated.

1139
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:52,090
Complicated?

1140
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:57,720
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

1141
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,090
Dangerous.

1142
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,130
What if it overtook her?

1143
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:05,400
She taught us it was forbidden...

1144
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:10,180
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

1145
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:12,110
She did what she thought was right.

1146
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:13,900
The bill comes due.

1147
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:16,240
Don't you see?

1148
01:30:17,770 --> 01:30:21,200
Her transgressions
led the Zealots to Dormammu.

1149
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,750
Kaecilius was her fault!

1150
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:26,660
And here we are...

1151
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:28,990
in the consequence of her deception.

1152
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:33,710
A world on fire.

1153
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,260
Mordo, the London Sanctum has fallen.

1154
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:38,210
The New York one
has been attacked twice.

1155
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:39,890
You know where they're going next.

1156
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:41,430
Hong Kong.

1157
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:43,830
You told me once to fight
like my life depended on it...

1158
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:44,920
because one day, it might.

1159
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:46,640
Well, today is that day.

1160
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:49,850
I cannot defeat them alone.

1161
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,660
The Sanctum's already fallen.

1162
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:18,460
The Dark Dimension.

1163
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:21,720
Dormammu is coming.

1164
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:25,350
It's too late.

1165
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,140
Nothing can stop him.

1166
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:30,770
Not necessarily.

1167
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:36,190
No.

1168
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:18,860
The spell's working.

1169
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,610
We've got a second chance.

1170
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,370
Whoa!

1171
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:03,220
No!

1172
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:14,850
Wong.

1173
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:24,900
Breaking the laws of nature. I know.

1174
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:28,570
Well, don't stop now.

1175
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:31,670
When the Sanctum's restored,

1176
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:32,870
they'll attack it again.

1177
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:34,120
We've got to defend it.

1178
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:35,620
Come on!

1179
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:04,890
Get up, Strange.

1180
01:35:05,190 --> 01:35:06,400
Get up and fight.

1181
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,270
We can finish this.

1182
01:35:09,610 --> 01:35:11,580
You can't fight the inevitable.

1183
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:16,740
Isn't it beautiful?

1184
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,660
A world beyond time.

1185
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:24,590
Beyond death.

1186
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:31,250
- Beyond time...
- Strange.

1187
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,460
He's gone.

1188
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:10,130
Even Strange has left you
and surrendered to his power.

1189
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:45,340
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1190
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,830
You've come to die.

1191
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:52,260
Your world is now my world...

1192
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:55,010
like all worlds.

1193
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:28,290
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1194
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:31,300
You've come to die.

1195
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:34,380
Your world is now my...

1196
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:37,050
What is this?

1197
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:39,060
Illusion?

1198
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:40,560
No. This is real.

1199
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,140
Good.

1200
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,440
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1201
01:37:55,690 --> 01:37:58,940
You've... What is happening?

1202
01:37:59,530 --> 01:38:02,330
Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension...

1203
01:38:02,410 --> 01:38:04,910
I brought a little power from mine.

1204
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,410
This is time.

1205
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:11,040
Endless looped time.

1206
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:13,500
You dare!

1207
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:14,960
Oh...

1208
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:19,600
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1209
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:22,880
You cannot do this forever.

1210
01:38:23,050 --> 01:38:24,600
Actually, I can.

1211
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:27,230
This is how things are now.

1212
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:30,430
You and me, trapped in this moment...

1213
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:31,610
endlessly.

1214
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:35,440
Then you will spend eternity dying.

1215
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:39,740
Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

1216
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,490
But you will suffer.

1217
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:43,620
Pain's an old friend.

1218
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:47,620
Dormammu...

1219
01:38:47,870 --> 01:38:48,960
I've come to bargain.

1220
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:50,120
End this!

1221
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:53,000
Dormammu... Dormammu...
Dormammu...

1222
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:12,230
You will never win.

1223
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:14,640
No...

1224
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:16,820
but I can lose...

1225
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:20,280
again and again...

1226
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:22,030
and again...

1227
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:24,820
and again, forever.

1228
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,820
And that makes you my prisoner.

1229
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:29,240
No!

1230
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:30,570
Stop!

1231
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:33,540
Make this stop!

1232
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:35,830
Set me free!

1233
01:39:36,830 --> 01:39:37,830
No.

1234
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:40,300
I've come to bargain.

1235
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:44,340
What do you want?

1236
01:39:46,130 --> 01:39:48,180
Take your Zealots from the Earth.

1237
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:50,850
End your assault on my world.

1238
01:39:51,470 --> 01:39:52,890
Never come back.

1239
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:54,480
Do it...

1240
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:57,230
and I'll break the loop.

1241
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:07,870
Get up, Strange!

1242
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:09,280
Get up and fight.

1243
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:11,500
We can finish this.

1244
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:13,230
Isn't it beautiful?

1245
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:17,880
A world beyond time.

1246
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,050
Beyond death.

1247
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:35,230
What have you done?

1248
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:36,940
I made a bargain.

1249
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:40,900
What is this?

1250
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:44,830
Well, it's everything you've ever wanted.

1251
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:48,080
Eternal life as part of the One.

1252
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:52,450
You're not gonna like it.

1253
01:41:12,430 --> 01:41:13,740
Yeah, you know, you really should have

1254
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,690
stolen the whole book
because the warnings...

1255
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:19,020
The warnings come after the spells.

1256
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:30,120
Oh, that's funny.

1257
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:58,980
We did it.

1258
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:02,980
Yes.

1259
01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:05,490
Yes, we did it.

1260
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:07,900
By also violating...

1261
01:42:08,150 --> 01:42:09,650
the natural law.

1262
01:42:10,490 --> 01:42:13,160
Look around you. It's over.

1263
01:42:13,410 --> 01:42:16,130
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

1264
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:19,250
No price to pay?

1265
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:22,830
We broke our rules, just like her.

1266
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:27,300
The bill comes due.

1267
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,100
Always!

1268
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:31,510
A reckoning.

1269
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:37,440
I will follow this path no longer.

1270
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:12,810
Yeah, okay.

1271
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:23,480
Wise choice.

1272
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:26,320
You'll wear the Eye of Agamotto...

1273
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,650
once you've mastered its powers.

1274
01:43:28,730 --> 01:43:29,900
Until then...

1275
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:33,650
best not to walk the streets
wearing an Infinity Stone.

1276
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:34,780
A what?

1277
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:38,250
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

1278
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,170
but you still have much to learn.

1279
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:45,290
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the Multiverse.

1280
01:43:45,370 --> 01:43:47,920
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme
to defend it.

1281
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:49,420
We must be ready.

1282
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:50,590
We'll be ready.

1283
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:40,430
<i>So Earth has wizards now, huh?</i>

1284
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:43,430
Tea?

1285
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:45,430
I don't drink tea.

1286
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:46,510
What do you drink?

1287
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:49,230
Not tea.

1288
01:46:52,730 --> 01:46:54,270
So, I keep a watch list...

1289
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:56,270
of individuals and beings
from other realms

1290
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,800
that may be a threat to this world.

1291
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:01,540
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

1292
01:47:03,950 --> 01:47:05,620
Worthy inclusion.

1293
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,870
Yeah.

1294
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:12,050
So why bring him here to New York?

1295
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:13,710
It's a bit of a long story.

1296
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:15,790
Family drama, that kind of thing.

1297
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,630
But we're looking for my father.

1298
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:21,350
Oh, okay. So if you found Odin...

1299
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:24,470
you'd all return to Asgard promptly?

1300
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:25,930
Oh, yes. Promptly.

1301
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:27,510
Great!

1302
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,430
Allow me to help you.

1303
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:32,790
Can I help you?

1304
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:37,170
They carried you into Kamar-Taj
on a stretcher.

1305
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:40,680
Look at you now, Pangborn.

1306
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:43,050
Mordo.

1307
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:47,730
So what can I do for you, man?

1308
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:49,650
I've been away
for many months now,

1309
01:53:49,730 --> 01:53:51,480
and I've had a revelation.

1310
01:53:52,350 --> 01:53:54,900
The true purpose of a sorcerer...

1311
01:53:55,190 --> 01:53:57,820
is to twist things out of
their proper shape...

1312
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:00,240
stealing power...

1313
01:54:01,070 --> 01:54:02,570
perverting nature.

1314
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:04,580
Like you.

1315
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:07,880
I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

1316
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:10,750
- Mine.
- Power...

1317
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:13,540
has a purpose.

1318
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:29,730
Why are you doing this?

1319
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:33,110
Because I see, at long last,
what's wrong with the world.

1320
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,530
Too many sorcerers.
