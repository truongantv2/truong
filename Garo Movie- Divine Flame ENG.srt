1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,860
Ah... Rita...

3
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,330
Mmm... What?

4
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,900
Ah... It feels really good...

5
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,180
Say, you're really knowledgeable, right?

6
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,800
Have you ever seen a demon?

7
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,140
I have.

8
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,440
Eh? No way!

9
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,510
It's true.

10
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,860
The demon of Vazelia Lake is really famous.

11
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,680
Here I go, Rita.

12
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,730
Oh, wait! I'm not ready yet...

13
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,380
H-Hey!

14
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,840
Mario?

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,930
W-What are you doing?

16
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,390
Who is that woman?!

17
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,520
No!

18
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,370
D-Don't come any closer!

19
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,980
If you behave yourself, it'll be over quick!

20
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,060
Run, now.

21
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,280
Ah? What's your problem, brat?

22
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,990
Do you wanna die?

23
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,230
I told you to run.

24
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,620
A Makai Knight, huh?

25
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,670
It's the horror Crimson Gale.

26
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,620
Beware of the scythes in its arms.

27
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:48,010
Your blade that hunts darkness subdues the lightning

28
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,250
Born to fight just right now!

29
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,370
Can nothing hold me back! Out of control!

30
00:04:53,230 --> 00:05:00,310
Your lineage can be felt in the pattern carved into you

31
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,330
Here I am, here I am, always!

32
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,160
No fear, try to wipe out Horror!

33
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,030
The Golden Knight?

34
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,540
The world is approaching its final hour

35
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,920
Wild! Wild! I wanna get wild!

36
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,240
A trap is surrounding us

37
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,040
Wild! Wild! I wanna get wild!

38
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,100
Look at the dead center of darkness

39
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,710
Wild! Wild! I wanna get wild!

40
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,320
And drive a threatening roar into it!

41
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,300
Sacred power!

42
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,720
So power of power!

43
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,520
Oh dangerous power!

44
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,020
Smash him into pieces!

45
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,810
Get more power!

46
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,110
So power of power!

47
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,070
Oh final power!

48
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,820
With your divine blade!

49
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,170
Prince! Prince Alfonso!

50
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,800
The tailor in charge of your clothes for the crowning ceremony is here!

51
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,690
Prince! Where are you?

52
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,120
Prince Alfonso!

53
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,130
Lady Christina, have you seen him?

54
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,170
If he doesn't see him soon, he'll get mad and leave!

55
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,000
Again?

56
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,150
I'm just bringing fruit from the garden, so if he's in a hurry, I can—

57
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,350
Ah, there he is!

58
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,800
Good grief. And to think he'll become king soon.

59
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,890
When will he stop being so mischievous?

60
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,810
There's nothing wrong with it. Let him have his way while he can.

61
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,480
Your Majesty!

62
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,820
It's been four years since that tragedy.

63
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:08,070
We owe the rebuilding of the kingdom to Alfonso's management.

64
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,490
He needs to let out steam.

65
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,730
But why does he leave the castle so often?

66
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,320
Could it be that he goes for ladies of the night?

67
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,910
Oh, I didn't mean to...

68
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,090
Relax, Christina.

69
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,920
Oh, don't worry about me...

70
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,620
If he were that kind of man,
he would have taken you as his wife long ago.

71
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,810
He went to see a friend of his.

72
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,800
That's all.

73
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,440
A friend who fought alongside him to save this kingdom.

74
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,380
León!

75
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,720
I knew you'd be here.

76
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,230
Alfonso.

77
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,840
Did you run away from the castle again?

78
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,830
Yeah.

79
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,320
I won't have this freedom much longer.

80
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,640
And...

81
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,710
Hi, Roberto!

82
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,510
I get so lonely when I don't get to see you.

83
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,880
Alfonso!

84
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,330
Roberto!

85
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,990
Good... Good morning, sir!

86
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,000
Right! Good morning!

87
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,190
You've gotten heavier again!

88
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,710
And you look more and more like uncle!

89
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,080
Let's see...

90
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,990
What will we do today?

91
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,340
Maybe some fishing?

92
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,590
Yeah!

93
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,380
Training.

94
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,490
Your swords are shaking!

95
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,940
Don't just move your wrists!

96
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,420
Lower your hip!

97
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,780
More!

98
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,700
You're doing well, Roberto!

99
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,380
That's it!

100
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,320
You've got talent!

101
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,410
As expected from uncle's son!

102
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,600
Hey, don't spoil him!

103
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,870
I'm not spoiling him.

104
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,070
Roberto is still three years old.

105
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,750
He's great for his age.

106
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,340
Dad had me training with a sword since I was one.

107
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,470
But that's you.

108
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,260
Roberto—

109
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,170
How soft.

110
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,090
What's wrong with being soft on a kid?

111
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,100
Roberto is my brother! Don't butt in!

112
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,760
He's also my cousin!

113
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,640
I'm so sorry.

114
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,430
I wonder if Roberto is crying again.

115
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,870
Even you scare him so much that he won't get near you, Jiruba.

116
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,040
Tell me, Jiruba.

117
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,300
If Germán saw Roberto, would he be disappointed that he's such a crybaby?

118
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,510
Do you think he'll be able to inherit Zoro's armor?

119
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,240
That depends on Roberto.

120
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,850
Skill is not what he needs to become a Makai Knight.

121
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,120
I see.

122
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,860
But it's okay if he doesn't become one,
but I would have liked for them to have met each other.

123
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,880
Don't you agree, Germán?

124
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,780
It looks like he got tired from crying.

125
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,540
Training always ends up like this.

126
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,400
So you are being too strict with him after all.

127
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,150
A Makai Knight's battles are harsh.

128
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:58,540
We throw our sense of self away, and we can't even feel hatred or compassion.

129
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,010
I just don't want Roberto to go through what I did.

130
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,520
And that's why you're being strict with him.

131
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,240
My mentor, Rafael, was hard on me too.

132
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,780
But I managed to endure it thanks to my dedication to protect Valiante.

133
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,530
Roberto is still very young.

134
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,190
Will he really be happy following the path of the Makai Knight?

135
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
We're back, Ximena!

136
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,900
That was fast.

137
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,600
The fact that you called us here means there's troublesome work to do.

138
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,240
Well, maybe.

139
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,240
A Horror has been living in Vazelia for half a year now.

140
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,700
Vazelia?

141
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,240
If I'm not mistaken...

142
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,840
There's been a Makai Knight assigned there for generations,
but we haven't been able to reach him for some years now.

143
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,090
Could he have been devoured by the Horror?

144
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,480
It's possible.

145
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,840
The Knights we sent later ended like that.

146
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,190
Sad, isn't it?

147
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,280
The only thing I can do is give them flowers like this.

148
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,570
We didn't come here to see you act!

149
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,200
Just give us some information on the Horror!

150
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,710
Dead Tower Horror, Nigra Venus.

151
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,210
It's the most beautiful Horror in the world.

152
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,090
If possible, I would like to keep it as a specimen.

153
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,760
How does that Horror fight?

154
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,670
It devours men and kills women by stripping off their faces.

155
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,930
That means its habits are as bad as yours, right?

156
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,100
But the real problem this time isn't the Horror.

157
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,750
Do you remember that guy?

158
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,400
Ah... Men... something... dooza... was it?

159
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,490
It's Mendoza! Of course we remember him!

160
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,210
Well, I would really like to forget about him.

161
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:34,560
The forbidden Mystic Tool created by him, Zirkel's Ring, has been discovered.

162
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,790
Where in hell...?

163
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,630
That was supposed to have been destroyed!

164
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,560
That doesn't matter anymore.

165
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:51,580
What's troublesome is that they're not using it to summon Horrors.

166
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,440
The souls that have been devoured by Horrors and fell to Makai...

167
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,760
The resurrection of the dead goes against the order of nature.

168
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,910
Plus, if we're talking about dozens or hundreds,
that would distort time and space.

169
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,580
Even the past could get changed.

170
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,210
We've confirmed plenty of sacrifices made for its activation already.

171
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,720
There's no time.

172
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,210
Wait.

173
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:29,520
We must make sure to stop Zirkel's Ring,
so I've arranged for some backup for this mission.

174
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,320
Join up with that man, and get the job done.

175
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,980
Vazelia, was it?

176
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,150
Alfonso, do you know the place?

177
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,900
A small kingdom in a lake in the mountains of Helene.

178
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,410
However, that kingdom doesn't exists anymore.

179
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,430
It suffered a tragedy five years ago.

180
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,650
Ximena! Roberto!

181
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,690
Roberto!

182
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,660
Someone! My son!

183
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,830
Ximena!

184
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,000
León, Roberto...!

185
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,810
Who are they?

186
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,160
I don't know!
They barged into our home and took Roberto with them!

187
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,220
Ximena!

188
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,750
It's okay! Leave Roberto to me and get back home!

189
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:08,530
León, take me with you. I have a bad feeling.

190
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,530
Jiruba...

191
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,030
Ximena, I'm taking Jiruba with me.

192
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,200
León... Please...

193
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,300
Who are they?

194
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,790
They don't seem to be Horrors,
but they don't look to be normal humans either.

195
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,990
Out of my way!

196
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,550
Zaruba, can you follow them?

197
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,020
No. I can't track them if they're not Horrors.

198
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,720
We will have to search for them.

199
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,770
Please settle down. I know where they're headed.

200
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,960
They're going to an old temple located west from here.

201
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:44,220
They'll go through the mountain to avoid being seen,
so we should be able to easily catch up to them.

202
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,000
How do you know that?

203
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,230
Who are you?

204
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,240
I am the Obsidian Knight, Zem.

205
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,030
My name is Darío Montoya.

206
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,780
They were sent by a Horror living in the temple.

207
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,280
My goal is to defeat that Horror.

208
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,480
Well, let's hurry, Golden Knight.

209
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,710
Wait.

210
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,130
My name is León.

211
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,490
León?

212
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,600
You...

213
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,850
How did you know that León is the Golden Knight?

214
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,960
Ah, pardon me.

215
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,430
León called you by your name: "Zaruba".

216
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:48,370
Only the Golden Knight can wear the Mystic Ring Zaruba.
Every Makai Knight knows that.

217
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,330
He's got you there, Zaruba.

218
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,800
Roberto...

219
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,950
God...

220
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,810
How sad...

221
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,310
We don't see each other for a little while and you forget about me?

222
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,340
Lady Ema!

223
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,240
I has been a while!

224
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,570
I heard you had returned to your home town.

225
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:05,240
I did, but it turns out a traveller's lifestyle suits me better.

226
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,790
Oh, so you came to see León-

227
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,170
What? You're joking right?

228
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,430
So it's true all you Makai Knights are dense in the head department.

229
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,510
It's a barrier. It means we're about to enter enemy territory.

230
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,350
Then you received orders too.

231
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah, orders from the Council.

232
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,230
When they were investigating the whereabouts of Mendoza's stolen invention, they found something terrible.

233
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,150
Zirkel's Ring... As I thought, it was a priest...

234
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,600
We don't know that.

235
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,920
I've been on watch for about two weeks now,
but there hasn't been any activity so far.

236
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,600
Well, now that you're here, Alfonso, I won't get bored.

237
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,160
L-Lady Ema!

238
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,850
Zirkel's Ring? I do not know of it.

239
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:13,060
I see. I thought you were the backup Garm had arranged for.

240
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,170
My apologies.

241
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,020
We are about to reach the temple.

242
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,260
Roberto's there.

243
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,860
Darío, thanks. You've been of great help.

244
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,880
Do not say that. This is also my mission.

245
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,710
Besides, the real trial is about to begin.

246
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,920
Wait, Missy!

247
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,210
The night is still young!

248
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,490
Well? Would you like to spend the night talking about my life?

249
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,960
Let's see...

250
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,470
Do you have any money?

251
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,920
I wouldn't do something as low as buying your love with money.

252
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,440
Well, well, well, well! We can continue this conversation in bed.

253
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,380
Wait!

254
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,260
C'mon!

255
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,000
How noisy.

256
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,600
He is going to get their attention.

257
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,910
León?

258
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,250
If you don't have money, get out of here. Shoo, shoo!

259
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,830
No, no! Don't say that!

260
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,410
How stubborn!

261
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,680
Playing hard to get, eh?

262
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,790
We don't need money for the sacred ritual we're gonna perform!

263
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:27,390
What the hell are you talking about?
I don't have the time to waste it with you!

264
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,330
If you keep insisting, you're gonna get hurt!

265
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,960
Oh! Your angry face looks beautiful!

266
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,320
What?

267
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,490
Hey, León!

268
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,440
You came at the right moment!

269
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,960
I just got back from Makai so I don't have a single penny on me.

270
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,170
So if you could lend me just a little, that would really save me.

271
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,360
No?

272
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,110
Damn it Garo.

273
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,520
I felt that.

274
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,340
Garm brought you back?

275
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,430
That's right.

276
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:24,980
She's acting as a relay with Makai, allowing me to materialize temporarily.

277
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,230
Can she do that?

278
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,880
She can.

279
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,240
Evidently.

280
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:37,080
Well, if the Council finds out Garm brought back a soul from Makai,
they won't leave her unpunished.

281
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,660
Why did she go to such lengths?

282
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,490
That shows how bad the situation is!

283
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:48,340
She was the one who secretly kept Zirkel's Ring
while the Council had ordered to destroy it.

284
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,710
What do you mean?

285
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,970
She intended to use it as a last resort when Mendoza resurrected Anima.

286
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,520
But... Why you?

287
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,770
Alfonso and I could have taken care of this.

288
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:10,560
If Zirkel's Ring ends up activating,
only a deceased like me can cross the gate to stop it.

289
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,240
Shit!

290
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,360
However, right now, I don't give a damn about Garm's plan.

291
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,910
I don't care about Zirkel's Ring either.

292
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,370
I'm gonna rescue Roberto. That's all.

293
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,370
Dad...

294
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,900
Oops!

295
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,400
Just a little further. Please be careful.

296
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,160
Roberto!

297
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,350
Roberto!

298
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,310
You!

299
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,080
This isn't a Horror, it's a Mystic Tool!

300
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,610
What?!

301
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,000
Roberto!

302
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Dad!

303
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,690
Dad, stay back! This is not for dead men to deal with!

304
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,780
How can you call your own dad a "dead man"?!

305
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,050
León, hand me my swords.

306
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,300
You've got them, right?

307
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,940
But in your current condition...

308
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,220
I know.

309
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,310
I'm practically half Horror right now.

310
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
Roberto!

311
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,090
I didn't expect you to pick a name so fitting.

312
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,530
The name that I threw away so long ago.

313
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,240
So it's as if...

314
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,160
He's a part of me.

315
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,250
If I don't protect him, who will?

316
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,250
Do you want to become a Horror?

317
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,490
I have no intention to.

318
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,750
Until I see Roberto's face, anyway.

319
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,910
León, give him his swords.

320
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,800
Jiruba!

321
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,920
I'll tell you when Germán's about to become a Horror.

322
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,060
Feel free to kill him then.

323
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,940
Thank you, partner!

324
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,450
León.

325
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,200
Dad, let's go!

326
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Yeah!

327
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,110
Dad!

328
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,940
Where could Zirkel's Ring be?

329
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,990
You don't get it yet?

330
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,960
Look at those giant pillars surrounding the lake.

331
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,720
It cannot be!

332
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,400
The lake itself is a Mystic Tool.

333
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,340
Do you see the tower at the center?

334
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,260
The activation device is most likely there.

335
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,180
Let's get closer and take a look around.

336
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,300
R-Right!

337
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,630
You survived thanks to me.

338
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,290
Be grateful.

339
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,290
What's going on here?

340
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,800
Obsidian Knight Zem.

341
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,290
He's the missing Makai Knight who was assigned to Vazelia.

342
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,290
What?

343
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,340
He was acting as a decoy. That's what this is about.

344
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,350
Yes. He intended to get rid of the nuisances.

345
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,760
And we fell right into it.

346
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,880
Roberto must be in Vazelia.

347
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,480
Wait, Lady Ema.

348
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,160
This is strange.

349
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,740
León is taking too long.

350
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,960
Something must have happened on the way-

351
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,100
One person wearing a black robe...

352
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,040
And...

353
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,910
A kid?

354
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,630
Roberto!

355
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,800
No! Why?

356
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,630
Alfonso?

357
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,640
He's the son of uncle and Miss Ximena.

358
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,300
What?!

359
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,440
But what's he doing here?

360
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,580
So he must have been abducted...

361
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,920
Hold on.

362
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,520
It's dangerous to move without thinking.

363
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,360
Don't forget that we're in the Horror's territory.

364
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,200
But...!

365
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,540
Darío!

366
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:27,970
Darío.

367
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,320
What did you do with Roberto?

368
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,090
How?

369
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,130
I felt your presences vanish.

370
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,430
It was thanks to Garm barrier.

371
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,890
I see.

372
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,800
What a shame.

373
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,470
Yeah. So tell us everything.

374
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,020
Or it'll become an even greater shame.

375
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,450
Dad!

376
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,240
Listen! I'm serious!

377
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,660
Where's Roberto?!

378
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,130
Son of a bitch! Are you being controlled by a Horror?!

379
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,870
I'm a guardian.

380
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:22,520
I have no recollection of having discarded my armor's
long-standing honour.

381
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,640
Darío!

382
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,420
I...

383
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,640
There is only one person I must protect.

384
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,280
This doesn't look good.

385
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,240
They're intending use Roberto as a key to activate Zirkel.

386
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,550
Lady Ema, Forgive me. I leave the rest up to you!

387
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,570
Alfonso!

388
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,980
Roberto!

389
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,720
Roberto!

390
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,650
Fantastic! You're really strong!

391
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,410
Hey!

392
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,340
Your name is Darío, right?

393
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,010
Everyone at the castle talks about you!

394
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,920
They say you're Vazelia's strongest knight!

395
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,700
Princess Sara!

396
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,080
Princess Sara, that is dangerous!

397
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,020
If anything happens to you, I...

398
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,870
It's okay.

399
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,740
You'll be there to protect me, right?

400
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,830
It burns...

401
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,670
My face...

402
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,090
It burns!

403
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,520
My face...

404
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,560
Princess Sara escaped death...

405
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,990
but she lost her beautiful face.

406
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,220
Princess Sara...

407
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,910
Darío, you should get out of here too.

408
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:33,260
I'm going to turn everything to ash.

409
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,740
That way, I'll put an end to this world.

410
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,620
I exist to protect you.

411
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,630
I will not leave your side.

412
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,850
Stop it!

413
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:48,330
Darío, don't look...

414
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,080
Don't look at me!

415
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:54,970
Princess Sara, I swore an oath back then.

416
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:57,210
That I will protect you until the end!

417
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:06,480
If you say my eyes make you suffer, in that case...

418
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,190
In that case, I have no need of them!

419
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,650
Darío, thank you for everything.

420
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,900
Princess Sara, why?

421
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,330
Goodbye.

422
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,580
Princess Sara!

423
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,600
Princess Sara...

424
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,070
Alfonso!

425
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,160
Alfonso!

426
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,930
Hey! Are you still alive?

427
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,060
Alfonso!

428
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,380
Ema, are you alright?

429
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,310
E-Ema?

430
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:50,350
Uncle!

431
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:54,560
Uncle, it cannot be...

432
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,190
You became a ghost!

433
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,980
No, well... Calm down you two.

434
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,870
I haven't become a ghost... Although it's something pretty clo—

435
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:09,610
If you're really Germán, I want you to give me a clear explanation.

436
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,870
Right. Now!

437
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:14,380
Yes, ma'am!

438
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,420
León, behind you!

439
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,850
León, please cease your actions.

440
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:46,910
Darío!

441
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:50,920
You do not know Princess Sara's suffering.

442
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,120
Yet you will still raise your sword against her?

443
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,500
Of course! Open your eyes!

444
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,840
She's a Horror!

445
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,240
Is that so?

446
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,920
That is a shame.

447
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,570
Darío, you're—!

448
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:40,910
I see.

449
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,790
You are the same as me.

450
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,690
You too, were not able to protect someone precious to you.

451
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,630
León, you must work with me.

452
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,070
If you do, we could resurrect that girl.

453
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,480
León!

454
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,800
Darío, enough! Don't stain your pride as a Makai Knight's anymore!

455
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,960
Why?

456
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,580
What is the difference between your feelings for Roberto
and my feelings for Princess Sara?

457
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,150
There is none!

458
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,380
To me, Princess Sara is the singlemost important person in the world!
I must protect her!

459
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,560
And for that purpose...!

460
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,380
Germán, we're retreating for now!

461
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:48,250
You're... really... strong...

462
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:52,990
No. I was unable to protect you that day.

463
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:54,930
But this time...

464
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,340
Traveller, how are you feeling?

465
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:12,880
Sorry. Since we're poor, this is all we have.

466
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:19,100
When Dad was around, we had it a little better.

467
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:24,380
Dad was good at hunting. He even brought home deer that were this big!

468
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:26,830
Yeah.

469
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:34,700
But, three years ago, in the forest...
he was attacked by wolves...

470
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,200
...and died.

471
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,100
How is your wound? Does it still hurt?

472
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,090
No.

473
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,350
You must be thirsty.

474
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,800
Where are Dad and Alfonso?

475
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,200
They're exploring the surrounding forest.

476
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,760
They've already found water and medicinal herbs.

477
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,850
I see.

478
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:26,780
León, it looks like you're starting to become a fine man.

479
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,260
W-What are you saying?!

480
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,260
Won't you give me a reunion kiss?

481
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,160
Ema...

482
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,730
Oh, León! You're awake?

483
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,800
D-D-Dad!

484
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,920
León, are you okay? Your face is all flushed.

485
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,070
Hey, hey, hey!

486
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,990
What were you two doing at a time like this?

487
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:57,610
Well... Who knows?

488
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,240
Wait a sec! We weren't doing anything, right! Ema!

489
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:09,050
León, you've really grown up.

490
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,760
Dad...

491
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:17,640
This means it was worth it talking to you
about the wonders of women time and time again.

492
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,620
As expected of a son of mine.

493
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:24,310
I have nothing left to teach you.

494
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:28,650
Now, let's go forth to town, and dedicate ourselves to the sacred ritual!

495
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,520
It looks like Dad went to investigate the bottom of the valley.

496
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,590
We should get ready too.

497
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:50,060
In other words, he plans to use Zirkel's Ring—

498
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:57,900
...he plans to use Zirkel's Ring to resurrect Princess Sara,
who was devoured by the Horror.

499
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,680
That's Darío's goal.

500
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,010
But with such a huge Mystic Tool...

501
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:09,360
If the gate is opened,
there will be more souls coming to our world besides that of Princess Sara's.

502
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:15,000
There's no doubt that would make the laws of causality collapse,
like Garm said.

503
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,200
I won't allow that.

504
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,360
The sacrifice for opening the gate is Roberto.

505
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,190
I'll bring him back no matter what.

506
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:29,630
Even if I have to kill Darío.

507
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:38,600
In order to protect one person... huh.

508
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,600
Dad!

509
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,710
Uncle!

510
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,930
You don't need to tell me.

511
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:49,180
But I can't back down now.

512
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:55,490
No matter what happens to my soul.

513
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:57,640
But, uncle...

514
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:02,360
Alright. If you become a Horror, I'll finish you.

515
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,120
León!

516
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:07,400
We can't let there me more Horrors in the world.

517
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,920
We'll rescue Roberto before Germán becomes one.

518
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,720
Let's hurry back to the lake.

519
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,600
God, protect my son.

520
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,700
Mom... León...

521
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,500
I am sorry.

522
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,950
It pains my heart to sacrifice someone as young as you.

523
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,290
Forgive me.

524
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:06,390
But I must protect her at any cost.

525
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:10,230
Whatever happens. As a guardian.

526
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,010
What's an ex-Makai Knight doing talking about protecting someone?

527
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,620
Darío, release Roberto right now! Face the judgment of the Council!

528
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:36,630
There is nothing I can say that will convince you otherwise.

529
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,630
Same with us.

530
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,650
Alfonso, are you ready? Like we planned!

531
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:13,580
Right!

532
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:02,070
You!

533
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:33,240
León!

534
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,500
Dad, go for Roberto! Quick!

535
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:52,630
You won't!

536
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:57,200
Uncle!

537
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,560
Alfonso!

538
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,440
Roberto...

539
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,290
Roberto!

540
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:40,600
Darío, you said there was no difference between my feelings and yours, right?

541
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:43,930
You were damn right!

542
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:55,630
I already acknowledged that I'm willing to sacrifice anything and anyone
in order to protect those precious to me!

543
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,030
I'm no different from a Horror!

544
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:06,040
I see. In that case...

545
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:11,130
Show me how you protect those precious to you!

546
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,680
Roberto!

547
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:26,690
Dad!

548
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:23,080
You are too late, León.

549
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:28,360
Now that I offered Germán Luís and his son as sacrifices,
¡Zirkel's Ring is complete!

550
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:36,200
There is a chance you can bring back the person you were not able to protect!

551
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,970
Come on. Work with me.

552
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:44,480
Release that chain, León.

553
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,640
Or will you become a sacrifice too?

554
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,960
Lady Ema!

555
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,570
Princess... Sara...

556
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:49,580
You're... really... strong...

557
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,750
Stop!

558
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:00,670
Alfonso!

559
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:03,180
Princess Sara! Princess Sara!

560
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:08,180
You're... really... strong...

561
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,730
No! I WILL save you this time!

562
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:24,780
How reckless! The gate hasn't even opened yet!

563
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:38,040
You're... strong...

564
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:57,600
Darío, you've always protected me.

565
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,020
Thank you.

566
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,710
Princess Sara!

567
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:33,520
Only you will be by my side.

568
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,340
Jiruba!

569
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,420
Leave it to me.

570
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:32,450
Who are you, mister?

571
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:34,370
Well...

572
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:36,700
Who knows?

573
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:54,640
Dad!

574
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:14,540
Roberto!

575
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:15,740
León!

576
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,270
May I?

577
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,270
Sure!

578
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:56,000
But why doesn't uncle tell Roberto that he's his father?

579
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,290
They have finally met...

580
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:02,570
When the sun goes down, Dad will disappear.

581
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:05,470
He doesn't want to make him sad.

582
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:08,460
That's why he's not seeing Ximena either.

583
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:12,730
Ah? What? That sounds like male self-satisfaction to me!

584
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:17,120
They only care about looking cool
without thinking about the feelings of the other person!

585
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:22,080
Oh, no. This is how uncle shows his kindness. Right, León?

586
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,600
Oh... Sure...

587
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,390
This isn't funny!

588
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:28,300
Hey, Roberto!

589
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,530
- Hey!
- Lady Ema!

590
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:33,100
That person is your dad!

591
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,200
Eh?! Ema!

592
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,480
Dad?

593
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:42,080
Eh? Well... I...

594
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,000
Germán?

595
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:47,080
Roberto!

596
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,600
Ximena...

597
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,990
Germán!

598
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,760
Germán! Germán!

599
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,100
Mom?

600
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,350
Roberto!

601
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:14,820
León, watch out!

602
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,840
Roberto! Ximena!

603
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:52,140
Dad!

604
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:53,480
Germán!

605
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:58,330
What a shame.

606
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:01,990
But I won't let you lay a single finger...

607
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:05,410
on my family.

608
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,300
Ximena... Roberto!

609
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:45,690
Roberto!

610
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,080
Roberto...

611
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:59,080
That's right!

612
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:03,800
I will never lose someone precious to me again!

613
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,880
That's what I promised Lara.

614
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:10,990
León.

615
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,680
León!

616
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,170
Lara.

617
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:32,480
I couldn't even protect a single thing I cared about.

618
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:37,470
But Lara granted me an eternal power.

619
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,690
Do you understand, Darío?

620
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:49,350
We're not here to protect just a single life,
but the hundreds and thousands of lives that await us.

621
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:57,690
And the power needed for that have been entrusted to me
by my dad, and my mother.

622
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:16,090
I must live on, and pass on the power of these feelings!

623
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:38,190
Roberto.

624
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:39,940
León!

625
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:42,270
I'll... defeat him...

626
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:43,870
I know.

627
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:48,450
But as you are now, you won't be able to destroy a Horror.

628
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:52,450
But... I...

629
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:54,170
want to protect mom.

630
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:57,200
I have to protect Mom!

631
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,460
Roberto.

632
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:06,480
The time for you to fight will come someday.

633
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,770
But, for now, lend me your power.

634
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:12,170
The power you will wield one day.

635
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:22,990
The strength of the feelings that bond people eternally
is the source of my power.

636
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,490
That's what it means to be...

637
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:33,020
The Golden Knight...

638
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,710
Garo!

639
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,470
Jiruba!

640
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:42,890
León!

641
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:48,090
Roberto, you did your best.

642
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,970
You're a real guardian.

643
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,970
León... Just now...

644
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:08,090
Mom...

645
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:12,480
It's alright. Don't cry.

646
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:32,270
I never thought I would get to hold my son.

647
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:35,870
I give you my thanks this time, Garm.

648
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:39,790
Stop it. That doesn't help me at all.

649
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:54,400
All the same, maybe I pushed myself too hard.

650
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:49,370
Roberto.

651
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:51,580
Are you tired?

652
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,580
No, I'm okay!

653
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:54,130
Hey!

654
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,880
Really? That's great.

655
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:01,480
Then, once we get back, let's all...

656
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,630
Yeah, let's train!

657
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:04,560
No.

658
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,230
Let's go fishing.

659
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:15,580
Yay!

660
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:53,900
I hold you gently

661
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:59,420
Going into a peaceful dream

662
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:04,750
If I could take you with me

663
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:10,140
I won't ever lose anything again

664
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:16,300
I'm sure that until my final day comes

665
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:21,040
I'll never forget you

666
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:26,140
Light and darkness come and go

667
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:31,920
With a voice that guides our rekindled bond

668
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:33,400
Come back to me!

669
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:41,740
The revolving memories of those precious days overflow within me

670
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:54,520
The trace you left allowed me to start walking carrying this new era

671
01:17:54,520 --> 01:18:00,430
Look! Under the crimson sunrise
