00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:50,058
Captain Sakaki, please respond.
We should be able to communicate.

3
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:53,683
My demands are to leave
Planet Tau-e immediately,

4
00:00:54,183 --> 00:00:56,142
and abandon the emigration project.

5
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:59,392
Until I hear from the captain,
I'm not moving from here.

6
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:03,558
The Tau-e emigration decision was made
by the Central Committee.

7
00:01:03,642 --> 00:01:07,725
Your interference will be classified
as a first-degree crime.

8
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:10,475
People will not survive on that planet!

9
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:14,392
If I'm a criminal,
then the Committee members are murderers!

10
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:15,433
Look at this.

11
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:19,142
The emigration list is made up
of volunteers.

12
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:20,642
Why do you interfere?

13
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:21,558
Shut up!

14
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:26,517
You gathered old men and women,
coerced them, and call that volunteering?

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,558
You're going to kill them!

16
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,808
All you want to do
is reduce the mouths to feed!

17
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,475
Watch your words, Captain!

18
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:36,975
We're communicating
through an open channel.

19
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:39,683
Everyone on this ship can hear us, right?

20
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:44,392
Right now, this ship is trying
to abandon the elderly people.

21
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,392
We may be low on resources.

22
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:48,725
But can this be forgiven?

23
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:53,225
Weren't we looking for the promised land
that would save us?

24
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:57,725
Can you really abandon the weak
and continue to hold your head up high?

25
00:01:57,808 --> 00:01:58,725
Captain Sakaki.

26
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:01,642
I'll wait one hour.

27
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:06,475
If this ship doesn't change course,
I will blow up this shuttle.

28
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:08,517
I'm not bluffing!

29
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:17,892
Please stop already, Captain Sakaki.

30
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:22,975
It's true that we, the volunteers,
really do want to go to Tau-e.

31
00:02:23,808 --> 00:02:26,558
We're not being chased out or anything.

32
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,058
Don't be foolish! This is suicide!

33
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,225
We've been on this ship for over 20 years
while wandering through space.

34
00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:37,308
The young people may be able
to endure this.

35
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,142
But for us, we're at our limit.

36
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:45,892
But... if you give up, then...

37
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:47,142
Haruo.

38
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,850
- ...then it's all over!
- Haruo!

39
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:52,142
It's okay.

40
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:56,808
At least, when I die,
I'd like to be standing on land.

41
00:02:57,808 --> 00:03:01,183
It could be on any planet.

42
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,017
Grandpa.

43
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:38,725
PLANET OF THE MONSTERS

44
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:48,100
It began in the last summer
of the 20th Century.

45
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,975
Look at that! It's a monster!
This is an unbelievable scene.

46
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,308
For the first time...

47
00:04:55,892 --> 00:05:00,517
humanity realized they weren't the rulers
of this planet anymore.

48
00:05:03,308 --> 00:05:04,142
Monsters.

49
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:11,600
From the depths of the earth and sea,
or even from a forgotten divine myth,

50
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:14,308
they kept appearing, relentlessly.

51
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:18,725
In order to bring an end
to humanity's prosperity.

52
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,725
The UN Countermeasure HQ
has named it "Godzilla."

53
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,808
And then, in the end,
our worst nightmare appeared.

54
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:27,808
Godzilla.

55
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:32,558
Human or monster,
it burned everything in sight.

56
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:35,142
The avatar of destruction.

57
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:40,392
At 2:30 EST, a large-scale nuclear attack
was launched against Godzilla, but failed.

58
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:46,308
At midnight, the EC Allied Forces
announced they have begun evacuations...

59
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:49,100
The earth collapsed
and the skies rained fire.

60
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:56,017
And then, it was not only Earth's humans
who feared its destructive power.

61
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,350
Above the UN building,
mysterious flying objects...

62
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:02,850
People of Earth, we are the Exif.

63
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:05,725
We are observers and predictors.

64
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:08,642
We have come to tell you of your destiny.

65
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:13,392
The time of destruction is nigh.
You must discover a path to devotion.

66
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,475
We are the Bilusaludo.

67
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:20,767
Our home planet, the third planet
in the Bilusaludia Binary System,

68
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,100
was swallowed by an accursed black hole
and destroyed.

69
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:28,058
We are requesting immigration
to this solar system's third planet.

70
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:35,100
If you accept, we promise to eradicate
your greatest threat, Godzilla.

71
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:40,017
Those from a far away galaxy, who were
after this blue planet for themselves,

72
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,225
didn't wait for this paradise of oxygen
and water to become scorched earth.

73
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,475
- Godzilla has passed the defense line!
- The walls will give us some time.

74
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:51,392
A3 and A5 blocks' AIs are silent!

75
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:54,683
- Mecha-Godzilla won't activate!
- Why won't it activate?

76
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:57,142
Atomic breath detected! Incoming!

77
00:06:58,142 --> 00:07:00,725
The fourth armored wall is gone!
It's over!

78
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:02,350
We have no choice. Evacuate!

79
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,017
All units, evacuate! Hurry!

80
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,767
Wait! If we can activate Mecha-Godzilla,
we can defeat it!

81
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,267
We're leaving, Galu-gu!

82
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:12,850
However, even with the humanoids'
gathered intelligence,

83
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,767
the destroyer's powers
overwhelmed us completely.

84
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,475
Where's Mom and Dad?

85
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:35,808
They'll catch up soon.
See? That's the bus.

86
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,308
Hey, what's that?

87
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:41,725
It's Godzilla!

88
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:43,392
Godzilla's here!

89
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,017
Haruo! Hurry up!

90
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:32,517
I remember the flames that burned the sky,

91
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,975
and the sunken, despaired faces
of the adults.

92
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:44,683
We departed hoping to find
another inhabitable planet.

93
00:08:46,517 --> 00:08:51,475
However, we would soon pay the price
for such foolish optimism.

94
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,308
In the frozen, black space,

95
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:03,100
this was a kind of hell
worse than our planet destroyed in flames.

96
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:12,892
There were endless days of suffering
from hunger, thirst, and cold.

97
00:09:15,392 --> 00:09:16,850
Some fell to disease.

98
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:20,475
And others gradually lost their sanity.

99
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:26,350
Our brethren's numbers plummeted
in the blink of an eye.

100
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:34,975
Even those still living had no time
to mourn the dead.

101
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:40,725
Kindness and pride are now
long-gone stories of the past.

102
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:52,308
A fairy tale from the time we each had
unlimited access to water and oxygen.

103
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:57,683
Where are we going... and for what reason?

104
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:03,808
Must we endure the misery
of having prolonged our lives

105
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:06,308
by sacrificing others?

106
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,683
Why are we alive?

107
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:12,267
Why?

108
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,267
Why?

109
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:31,558
Were you having a nightmare?

110
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:34,725
So, you're here, Metphies.

111
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:39,933
It's also my job to listen
to a prisoner's confession.

112
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:42,350
So I should repent to your god?

113
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:45,808
I'd settle for a fake confession, too.

114
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,475
Here's the data you asked for.

115
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:52,975
Thank you.

116
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,767
You have quite the persistence.

117
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:59,308
I don't have anything else to do.

118
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:02,725
Won't you get in trouble
if they find out you're helping?

119
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:05,725
I have an interest in your enthusiasm.

120
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:09,808
Why are you so curious
about digging up forbidden data

121
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:13,100
that anyone would otherwise
wish to forget exists?

122
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,558
"Why," you ask?

123
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:19,308
I've also been thinking "why."

124
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:25,017
Ever since I was thrown in here,
that word won't get out of my head.

125
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:28,267
Why have we become so miserable?

126
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:32,433
Was it inevitable? A justified punishment?

127
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:34,558
No.

128
00:11:35,058 --> 00:11:39,267
The reason we're suffering
is because we lost to that bastard.

129
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,642
We didn't fight to the end,
but gave up and ran away.

130
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:45,808
Everything is destiny.

131
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:51,683
We humanoids had no way
of fighting that monster.

132
00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:54,350
I disagree.

133
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,433
And I'll show them.

134
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:04,975
We just needed the right strategy
and planning,

135
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,142
and humanity could have defeated it.

136
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:09,725
I'll prove it.

137
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:12,808
It's a strange thing.

138
00:12:14,142 --> 00:12:19,933
Unlike the young ones, your generation
experienced the calamity firsthand.

139
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:27,475
And yet, it's as if
you want to see that creature again.

140
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:37,725
Based on the Gematron calculation,
the predictions look disappointing.

141
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:44,392
The possibility of finding
a habitable planet in 20 years is 0.1%.

142
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:48,725
If we want better results than Tau-e,
the outlook is even grimmer.

143
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:51,100
The lack of resources is severe.

144
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:56,683
Even doubling the discomfort index,
life will be unsustainable in eight years.

145
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,892
The landing ship explosion the other day
was a significant psychological blow.

146
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:03,892
- This is getting...
- Indeed.

147
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:07,642
We need to examine scenario number three
in a realistic way.

148
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:13,100
Returning to Earth.
It's already 11.9 light years away.

149
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:17,017
There's no precedent for traveling so far.
It's too risky.

150
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,933
Gematron's guidance isn't bound
by time or distance.

151
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:25,183
As long as the nuclear reactor
has sufficient energy, travel is possible.

152
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:29,767
According to the ship's simulator,
it requires 170% of its operation ratio.

153
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,558
I don't know if we can mobilize
the manpower.

154
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:36,683
Would it be a constructive decision
to abandon the emigration?

155
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,058
That's the problem.

156
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:41,642
If we return to Earth,
would we be able to survive?

157
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,558
It is currently impossible to calculate
how much time has passed on Earth.

158
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:49,892
At the very least, a few thousand years.

159
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:54,683
Since we fled Earth,
the environment should have calmed down.

160
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,267
It's possible it could've gotten worse.

161
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:04,225
The problem is that strange thesis
published on the shared server.

162
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:08,475
Why would that research thesis appear
at a time like this?

163
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,017
The writer remains anonymous,

164
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,058
but it contains information that requires
special log-in credentials to access.

165
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,558
The author aside, there's probably
an informant in the Central Committee.

166
00:14:21,642 --> 00:14:22,892
R-Ridiculous!

167
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:29,892
There's an electromagnetic shield
under the body's surface?

168
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:31,517
It's not a normal organism?

169
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,892
No, its whole body is like a giant coil.

170
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:36,558
Is that true?

171
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:38,808
So, what happened in the end?

172
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:40,183
It's kind of weird.

173
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:44,683
A new Gematron code is using 80%
of the calculation server's power.

174
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:45,850
Eighty percent?

175
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:48,225
Isn't it the analysis for predictions?

176
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:50,683
Still, for a simulation, it's too much.

177
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,892
So, the rumor
of returning to Earth is true?

178
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:57,892
It's 11.9 light years in one go.

179
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,225
Is a subspace jump-warp even possible?

180
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:03,142
It's not a problem
if we use Gematron calculation.

181
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:05,350
I heard it directly from Navigation.

182
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,517
Gematron, huh?

183
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:10,433
The ship leaders turn to the gods,
as usual.

184
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:15,975
Maybe even that new anti-Godzilla tactic
was a leak from the higher-ups?

185
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:18,767
Man, are we going to fight it again?

186
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:23,642
It's a monster that withstood an attack
of 150 nuclear warheads at once.

187
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,975
That's 40 megatons of nucleoplasm total.

188
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:30,433
But the thesis contained new strategies
on how to fight it.

189
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:31,350
Huh?

190
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:44,933
It's me.

191
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:46,433
Hey, come in.

192
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:53,433
So, the Central Committee is leaning
towards going to Earth, huh?

193
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:55,058
Not entirely.

194
00:15:55,683 --> 00:15:58,642
To give up searching
for a habitable planet

195
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,517
means someone has to bear
that responsibility.

196
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:07,017
If they're so weak they give up drifting
after only 20 years, it can't be helped.

197
00:16:07,725 --> 00:16:09,558
Well, I do sympathize.

198
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:15,017
They haven't dealt with the loss
of their home planet as long as we have.

199
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,558
And then, there's your practical joke.

200
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:21,475
Obviously, it's a headache for Mori.

201
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:25,600
I uploaded a new version this morning.
Did you read it?

202
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:30,683
Yeah. When I downloaded it,
it already had over 400 views.

203
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:33,767
Though the file was deleted
three seconds later.

204
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:37,433
Our delinquent captain sure is popular.

205
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:42,517
When there's rumor of returning to Earth,
we get more talk of Godzilla.

206
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:45,558
It's effective for ridiculing
the Central Committee.

207
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,017
Haruo is unaware of
the Central Committee's expectations.

208
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:53,642
He was researching Godzilla
purely for personal interest.

209
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:59,100
But this thesis has content that will
support our plan to return to Earth.

210
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:03,808
Its claim is that
Godzilla can be defeated by human hands.

211
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:08,433
If you can't understand its contents,
it just sounds like crazy prattling.

212
00:17:08,683 --> 00:17:11,933
Earthlings harbor that much fear
of Godzilla.

213
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,808
So, do you think
it's just crazy prattling?

214
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:18,183
This analysis report?

215
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:21,308
No, it's actually quite interesting.

216
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:24,600
So much so, I think better of him.

217
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:27,017
Godzilla is not invincible.

218
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:30,683
It's humanity's fault for giving up
on the fight.

219
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,808
That's what Haruo thinks.

220
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:40,558
He analyzed that old data because
of you Exifs' Gematron calculation.

221
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:43,850
It was impossible for Earthlings
at the time.

222
00:17:44,058 --> 00:17:47,558
Are you saying that, if the weak-point
analysis had been made in time,

223
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:50,058
that humanity
still wouldn't have been victorious?

224
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:53,975
And if they did defeat Godzilla,

225
00:17:54,683 --> 00:17:59,933
then it was only a matter of time
until Exif's cult took over Earth.

226
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:04,183
Even if Bilusaludo's Mecha-Godzilla
had defeated Godzilla,

227
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:07,558
no one knows
who it would have bared its fangs at next.

228
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:15,183
However, we failed in the construction
of Mecha-Godzilla.

229
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:18,683
And you couldn't brainwash Earthlings
with your religion.

230
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:20,350
That's history now.

231
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,808
The what-ifs are only fairy tales.

232
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:33,850
Subspace jump-warp procedure,
now entering phase two.

233
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:36,100
Activating shields for all ship sections.

234
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:38,517
Bypassing electricity
for the gravitational coil engine.

235
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,850
Initiating Gematron calculation
and gravitational coils controller.

236
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:45,808
Begin cluster connections with Gematron
calculation crystal and central AI.

237
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:49,308
Gravitational coil engine
for all sections functioning normally.

238
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:50,600
Preparations for spin complete.

239
00:18:50,683 --> 00:18:54,767
Subspace coordinate system render
will be displayed on the central hologram.

240
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,600
Attention all personnel.

241
00:18:56,808 --> 00:19:00,350
This ship, Aratrum,
will soon initiate subspace jump-warp.

242
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:04,850
Estimated emergence coordinates are near
the solar system's third planet, Earth.

243
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:08,767
Based on the ship's time,
22 years have passed since our departure.

244
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,267
This subspace jump-warp
will be the longest we've traversed.

245
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,892
Finally. The real Earth!

246
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,475
I wonder if we can see the ocean?

247
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:20,100
That'd be awesome if we can!

248
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,725
The longest? Is this really safe?

249
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:27,392
...no idea what changes
Earth's environment has undergone.

250
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:28,642
After an investigation,

251
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:33,350
if we conclude the environment
has become unfit for human survival,

252
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,058
we will collect resources...

253
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,433
Hey, is the real Earth
prettier than the hologram?

254
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:40,308
Yes, it is.

255
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:45,350
Entering Gematron-predicted coordinates.
Suspending main propulsion drive.

256
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,975
We now have all the Gematron numbers.

257
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:51,183
Irrational numbers converted to integers.
Computing time-space recon point.

258
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:55,267
Chances of a wormhole appearing is 440%
in a simulated observation.

259
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,767
Releasing gravitational coil output
for each section of the ship.

260
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,725
Maximum spin.

261
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,642
Captain, on your order.

262
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:10,600
Initiate jump-warp.

263
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,975
Jump-warp initiated. Commence shift
into phase one space travel.

264
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,183
Gravitational coil at max speed,
running stable.

265
00:20:39,392 --> 00:20:41,975
Arriving at launch point
required for final trajectory.

266
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:46,600
Breaking through subspace.

267
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:12,933
Amazing.

268
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:15,475
Hey, it's really blue!

269
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:17,683
- That's the ocean?
- It's beautiful.

270
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:19,267
That's Earth?

271
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,017
Yes, that's right.

272
00:21:21,183 --> 00:21:22,558
It really is blue!

273
00:21:22,642 --> 00:21:25,600
To think that I'd see it again.

274
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:29,975
Disabling shields in all sections.
Normal travel mode stable.

275
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:32,767
Distance from Earth, 1,800 kilometers.

276
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:35,725
Recalculating low orbit entrance errors.

277
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:45,558
Our Earth that was taken from us.

278
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,100
Orbit errors corrected.

279
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,100
Now entering low Earth orbit.

280
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:56,350
If we can't land on Earth,
we'll have a revolt on our hands.

281
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:58,933
It's too soon to be pessimistic.

282
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:01,850
Let's just wait for the scouting report.

283
00:22:02,183 --> 00:22:04,350
Unmanned recon drones
launching in sequence.

284
00:22:09,392 --> 00:22:11,808
All drone feedback systems are stable.

285
00:22:12,183 --> 00:22:15,142
Begin dispersion to specified areas
for surveillance.

286
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:22,225
Entering the stratosphere.
Drone temperature stable.

287
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,350
Altitude 30,000 meters, beginning descent.

288
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:31,225
Altitude 15,000 meters,
entering the troposphere.

289
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,392
Stellar observation parallax calculated.

290
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,725
Elapsed time for the solar system
is approximately 10,000 years.

291
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:40,267
It's been 10,000 years? That long?

292
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,975
It's more than I imagined.

293
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:43,767
This could be good news.

294
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,142
With that much time,
the ecosystem must have changed.

295
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:48,267
Not even Godzilla...

296
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:49,475
I wonder.

297
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:52,142
It's possible it could've multiplied.

298
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:55,100
That thing is a genetic aberration.
It's impossible!

299
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:59,308
Recon drones are at a scouting altitude
of 2,000 meters.

300
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,683
Receiving visuals.

301
00:23:01,975 --> 00:23:04,392
Drone six displaying sound signal monitor.

302
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,850
Just the sound of the wind?

303
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:11,225
We can't see anything.
Can you lower the altitude?

304
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,600
All drones descending.

305
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,517
There are thick particles floating
in the atmosphere.

306
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:19,225
Average visibility less than 300 meters.

307
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:23,058
This is...
Picking up electromagnetic interference.

308
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,017
This isn't just a normal fog.

309
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,392
Switching drones to sensor monitors.

310
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:32,808
Each drone's altitude at 500 meters.

311
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:34,808
Atmospheric density is increasing.

312
00:23:34,892 --> 00:23:37,517
Further descent by remote is impossible.

313
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,642
Is this a forest?

314
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:42,517
Or some kind of complicated terrain.

315
00:23:42,975 --> 00:23:44,850
Can you increase the scan power?

316
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:48,225
Its reflection is diffused,
so this is the limit.

317
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:51,142
What's that?

318
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:52,933
It's moving.

319
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,975
Drone six,
switching to sound wave reconnaissance.

320
00:23:56,892 --> 00:23:59,725
Temperature around drone six
is increasing drastically!

321
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:02,392
- What?
- What's happening?

322
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,558
Drone six, lost!

323
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,267
Estimated energy output around drone six
approximately 180 gigawatts.

324
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:20,100
High probability of high-energy
electron particles, or atomic breath!

325
00:24:24,642 --> 00:24:27,017
M-Maybe it was thunder or...

326
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,433
Idiot! No one would ever forget that roar!

327
00:24:32,183 --> 00:24:36,183
Damn it. It's still on this planet.

328
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:45,850
You're there, aren't you?

329
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:49,225
You're still there!

330
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:58,892
If the characteristics match this closely,
then that was Godzilla,

331
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:02,475
or a threat similar to it,
and it must be eliminated.

332
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:08,642
Our one advantage is that it acts
independently rather than in a pack.

333
00:25:08,892 --> 00:25:11,017
How can you say that for sure?

334
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,058
The concentration of radiation.

335
00:25:14,142 --> 00:25:19,558
As you're aware, Godzilla is a creature
that scatters heavy radiation in its wake.

336
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:24,058
However, even though the terrain
has undergone change,

337
00:25:24,142 --> 00:25:27,767
the toxins present in the atmosphere
are maintaining stable numbers.

338
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,767
If we reverse calculate the emission data
gathered in the past three days,

339
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:35,600
multiple Godzillas seem unlikely.

340
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:39,850
Even now,
Godzilla is a unique genetic defect

341
00:25:40,392 --> 00:25:44,517
and cannot be considered
a normal living creature, is what I mean.

342
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,850
However, it's been 10,000 years.
How can it still be alive?

343
00:25:49,642 --> 00:25:53,017
There are cases where lotus seeds survived
for 2,000 years.

344
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:57,767
It also may be repeating cycles
of dormancy every few thousand years.

345
00:25:58,017 --> 00:26:00,725
Or, over 10,000 years,
it could have multiplied

346
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:04,933
and diminished in number,
with this being the last surviving one.

347
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:10,642
Godzilla's biology is beyond
every known aspect of life science.

348
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:14,933
And we can't ignore the possibility
that it could be immortal.

349
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:18,683
Studies and research
aren't this meeting's main subject.

350
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:22,392
We humanoids cannot coexist with Godzilla.

351
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:27,100
However, if that is indeed Godzilla,
and the last one,

352
00:26:27,683 --> 00:26:29,433
then there is only one option.

353
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:32,267
Complete extermination.

354
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:34,850
Are you utterly insane?

355
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:41,100
As you are all aware,
we have drafted anti-Godzilla strategies.

356
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:44,767
You mean that anonymous thesis?

357
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,975
We don't even know who wrote it!

358
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:51,725
It's from a specialist's investigation.

359
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:54,308
It's deemed as promising information.

360
00:26:54,517 --> 00:27:01,225
I am also prepared to release the name
of the person who wrote it, right here.

361
00:27:02,308 --> 00:27:04,433
However, there are conditions.

362
00:27:04,683 --> 00:27:07,017
And what would those conditions be?

363
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,808
To drop the charges regarding
the stolen secret information, and then...

364
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,808
release Captain Haruo Sakaki on bail.

365
00:27:15,475 --> 00:27:17,767
Captain Sakaki? It was him?

366
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,017
You got us, Metphies.

367
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:26,683
All shall be according to God's will.

368
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,558
It's your turn.

369
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,433
Haruo.

370
00:27:46,308 --> 00:27:50,558
It's here. This waveform is generating
the electromagnetic metamaterial.

371
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:55,642
Since each of Godzilla's cells
can function as a powerful electromagnet,

372
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,183
it emits a high-output,
high-frequency electromagnetic pulse

373
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:02,183
and generates
an asymmetrically permeable shield.

374
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:04,725
A physically impervious shield?

375
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:09,183
It may be enormous,
but can a creature even do that?

376
00:28:09,517 --> 00:28:13,392
And if that were true,
how can we even begin to fight it?

377
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:18,183
It's only for about 1/10,000 of a second,
but it emits a noise periodically.

378
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:21,433
If we use an interference wave,
we can amplify that noise

379
00:28:21,517 --> 00:28:26,517
to fracture the metamaterial,
and we'll target that point.

380
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:31,975
So by attacking a single point,
we can take that colossal thing down?

381
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:36,017
There should be an organ
amplifying the electromagnetic pulse.

382
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,058
If we destroy that,
we can neutralize the shield.

383
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:40,600
And where is it?

384
00:28:41,058 --> 00:28:41,892
Unknown.

385
00:28:42,225 --> 00:28:45,267
There isn't enough data
in our visual records.

386
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:49,725
We need to observe Godzilla
and analyze the emission pattern.

387
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,892
As you know from past battles,

388
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,725
we can confirm Godzilla has
tremendous regenerative abilities.

389
00:28:57,225 --> 00:29:02,100
The destroyed organs will regenerate, and
in the seconds before the shield goes up,

390
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:06,642
we need to shove an EMP probe
into its body and destroy it from within.

391
00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:10,475
The main issue with this operation
is the changed atmosphere,

392
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,308
and the electromagnetic wave interference.

393
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:16,267
To observe and find Godzilla's weak point,

394
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,267
we need detailed coordination
with accurate attacks,

395
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,767
so close quarters combat is required.

396
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:23,475
And for each process,

397
00:29:23,808 --> 00:29:26,683
we need manpower,
otherwise we cannot succeed.

398
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:27,892
Preposterous!

399
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,308
Even if we gather all the races,
there are only 4,000 of us.

400
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:35,767
I cannot approve an operation
where lives can be lost.

401
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,558
Captain Sakaki.

402
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,392
I'll be blunt.

403
00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:44,350
In order for your operation to work,
how many people do you need?

404
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:49,058
Combat engineers, infantry,
and special forces, so three battalions.

405
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,808
If I form two companies from each,

406
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:54,100
we're looking at about 600 people.

407
00:29:55,892 --> 00:29:57,267
Out of the question.

408
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:05,725
Those who do not fight,
know not how to fight evil.

409
00:30:05,808 --> 00:30:10,017
Those gathered now, unified as one,
shall come to know God's mercy.

410
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,767
Give praise to God.
All shall lead down the devoted path.

411
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:19,433
Garbetrium guidance be with you all.

412
00:30:21,392 --> 00:30:25,558
This is Colonel Elliot Leland,
commander of the Earth Landing Brigade.

413
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:27,933
Everyone, continue your tasks and listen.

414
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:32,642
All 600 gathered here
are the chosen elite forces

415
00:30:32,725 --> 00:30:37,558
who have decided to give their lives
to fight against Godzilla.

416
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:40,892
Everyone correctly understands

417
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:46,933
that there will be no constructive outlook
if you're trapped in an old society.

418
00:30:47,725 --> 00:30:49,558
Instead of a fake promised land,

419
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,225
we will take back our homeland,

420
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:55,558
and promise prosperity
to the next generation.

421
00:30:56,517 --> 00:31:01,058
For the sake of humanity's future,
I look forward to everyone's efforts.

422
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,808
All assembled landing ships
have exited the gates.

423
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,183
Now closing the first launch gate station.

424
00:31:18,725 --> 00:31:22,850
That speech sounded like you wanted
to pick a fight with the Committee.

425
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:25,308
Hey, Haruo.

426
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:30,475
Didn't you also want to get
the Committee members frustrated?

427
00:31:31,392 --> 00:31:35,308
With the current system,
those members will just dry up and die.

428
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,475
There aren't any comfortable chairs
for us.

429
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,808
But if we defeat Godzilla,
then the story will be different.

430
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:45,350
A new hero will arrive.

431
00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:47,475
Our era will come.

432
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:49,850
A hero, huh?

433
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:52,475
You're just like when you were a kid.

434
00:31:53,975 --> 00:31:57,392
Don't take it the wrong way.
You're still on bail status.

435
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:00,850
We went through a lot
just to get you back out.

436
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:01,767
Commander.

437
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:05,350
All landing ships have assembled
in low orbit.

438
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,350
All ships, enter in sequential order.

439
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:10,267
Roger.

440
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,350
All ships,
begin entry in sequential order.

441
00:32:16,892 --> 00:32:18,725
Ship ten, ignite engine.

442
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,558
Deploy anti-aerodynamic drag
and heat shield.

443
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:25,183
You look unhappy.

444
00:32:25,475 --> 00:32:27,725
Even though your wish is being granted.

445
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:30,892
I wonder if everything will go
according to plan.

446
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:35,517
It'll be okay. As long as we have the hero
who will guide them.

447
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:38,392
Are you a Leland sympathizer?

448
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:42,725
Well, the one I put my hope in
is you,

449
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:44,267
Haruo.

450
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,308
The one true path to glory
can only be opened through devotion.

451
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,808
This is our, the Exif's, creed.

452
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:57,683
There are only a few Earthlings
who embody that.

453
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,642
You're a rare exception.

454
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,267
You overestimate me.

455
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:07,850
You are the one who is worthy
of fighting Godzilla.

456
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:11,850
The time will come soon enough
when that can be proven.

457
00:33:22,642 --> 00:33:24,058
Ship temperature stable.

458
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:28,183
Passing the stratosphere.

459
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:29,975
Altitude 30,000 meters.

460
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:32,850
Igniting arc jet thrusters for cruising.

461
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:47,183
Once we go under those clouds,
we won't see the sun anymore, huh?

462
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,142
This planet has been
completely changed, too.

463
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:53,267
Now entering the troposphere.

464
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:58,683
Altitude 2,000. All ships,
begin navigating towards landing zone.

465
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,433
The visibility's terrible.

466
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,267
Switching the ship's probes to ultrasonic.

467
00:34:04,683 --> 00:34:06,058
Begin image processing.

468
00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:09,850
Company A, landing zone confirmed.

469
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,433
Obstacles detected.

470
00:34:11,725 --> 00:34:15,642
As the reconnaissance drones reported,
this is a thick forest.

471
00:34:15,725 --> 00:34:19,475
Securing landing point now.
Prepare the thermobaric bombs.

472
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,017
Roger. Dropping thermo-pressure warheads.

473
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:36,058
They're being grandiose over there.

474
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:39,267
Well, the special forces will land
on impeded terrain.

475
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:40,892
What?

476
00:34:41,308 --> 00:34:44,017
An obstacle collided
with the ship's exterior.

477
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:47,433
No issues so far with power and steering.

478
00:34:47,808 --> 00:34:49,100
An obstacle?

479
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:02,933
Lieutenant Colonel Galu-gu,
Company E has also landed.

480
00:35:03,558 --> 00:35:06,392
We will now set
the combat engineers' traps.

481
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:07,308
Okay.

482
00:35:09,642 --> 00:35:11,433
The old Tanzawa Pass, huh?

483
00:35:12,808 --> 00:35:15,267
If it was sunny,
it would've been beautiful.

484
00:35:16,142 --> 00:35:19,892
With this heavy fog,
a visual battle would be impossible.

485
00:35:21,808 --> 00:35:24,475
Lieutenant Colonel Galu-gu, please look.

486
00:35:24,558 --> 00:35:25,475
This is...

487
00:35:25,642 --> 00:35:28,308
Doesn't it look like
something scratched it?

488
00:35:28,975 --> 00:35:31,808
I hope the others are okay out there.

489
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:35,392
Get the transmission balloons!

490
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:38,183
You don't need to unload
the medical supplies.

491
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:49,475
Transmission balloon reception favorable.

492
00:35:50,225 --> 00:35:54,850
Companies B and C special force units
will reach their destination on schedule.

493
00:35:55,475 --> 00:36:00,350
Companies D and E will deploy artillery
as the combat engineers lay down traps.

494
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:04,183
Okay, the first battle formation
is going according to plan.

495
00:36:04,725 --> 00:36:09,142
Whichever company finds Godzilla first,
open fire with the special forces.

496
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:11,142
Provoke it and divert its course.

497
00:36:11,475 --> 00:36:16,808
What's important is to observe Godzilla's
electromagnetic waves when it's attacked.

498
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:22,267
We'll analyze this data to see which organ
emits the electromagnetic wave.

499
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,933
Once we destroy that, we can neutralize
the asymmetrically permeable shield.

500
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:31,767
And finally, we'll chase Godzilla
into this Tanzawa Pass,

501
00:36:31,892 --> 00:36:34,808
and slow it
with traps set by the engineers.

502
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:38,267
The artillery unit will then open fire
from a close range.

503
00:36:38,475 --> 00:36:43,642
We'll amplify the pulse noise,
attack all at once, and destroy the organ.

504
00:36:44,475 --> 00:36:49,600
The shield will go down for a few seconds,
and then we'll use EMP probes to end it.

505
00:36:50,683 --> 00:36:54,767
If we can't find the amplifying organ,
we can't place the infantry.

506
00:36:55,058 --> 00:36:56,058
Exactly.

507
00:36:56,808 --> 00:37:01,017
The special forces analysis of the pattern
will influence the plan.

508
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:06,100
So they'll spread out into a wide area,
and advance while analyzing the enemy.

509
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:07,892
Cooperation is key.

510
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:13,767
But who knew we'd have to rely
on something this pathetic to communicate?

511
00:37:14,808 --> 00:37:17,725
If we can transmit
through this convection cloud,

512
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:22,058
the drones in the stratosphere will relay
our communication with no issues.

513
00:37:22,392 --> 00:37:26,100
But in this fog,
electronic communication will be limited.

514
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:29,433
What is going on
with this planet's atmosphere?

515
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:32,183
That's what we're trying to find out.

516
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:35,808
Colonel, I'd like to form
an investigation team.

517
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:38,725
If I can borrow three teams, as planned.

518
00:37:38,808 --> 00:37:42,475
The scouting team takes priority.
I'll give you two teams.

519
00:37:43,183 --> 00:37:44,183
All right, then.

520
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:49,058
I'd like to go, too. I want to see with
my own eyes how this terrain has changed.

521
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,308
You heard him.

522
00:37:50,642 --> 00:37:53,267
- Master Sergeant Yuko Tani, you're up.
- Yuko?

523
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,767
You'll be his handler.
As you know, he's been released on bail.

524
00:38:02,308 --> 00:38:04,100
So be careful handling him.

525
00:38:04,475 --> 00:38:05,308
Understood.

526
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:29,475
Unbelievable. Are these really the plants
growing on Earth?

527
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:33,267
Is this what I saw in the ship's records?
Trees, was it?

528
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:35,183
They look different, though.

529
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:51,808
Don't touch it!

530
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,183
In some places they're sharp as razors.

531
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,058
It'd be deadly
if your airtight suit got a hole in it.

532
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,850
Why did you request to join this mission?

533
00:39:23,308 --> 00:39:27,975
Because you're involved, Captain Sakaki,
and set up the operation.

534
00:39:28,558 --> 00:39:31,517
Please don't call me that.
Just Haruo is fine.

535
00:39:34,017 --> 00:39:38,058
I've always wanted to meet you
so we could speak in person.

536
00:39:39,017 --> 00:39:44,558
I wondered if it's because of you, Cap...
Haruo, that grandpa died at Tau-e.

537
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,683
I...

538
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:49,017
The bombs that you brought
inside the shuttle,

539
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:53,767
I heard from security
that they were definitely all removed.

540
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,517
But then the emigration group...

541
00:39:57,683 --> 00:39:59,475
Do you think it was an accident?

542
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,683
You don't think it was?

543
00:40:03,892 --> 00:40:08,433
You said the Central Committee
wanted to reduce passengers.

544
00:40:09,183 --> 00:40:12,892
They could have used some trick
so the emigration group wouldn't...

545
00:40:12,975 --> 00:40:15,308
The Central Committee isn't that corrupt!

546
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,725
That's what I want to think. I don't
want to be suspicious of my comrades.

547
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:22,225
Haruo.

548
00:40:24,183 --> 00:40:28,767
No, that's not it. I couldn't forgive
myself for wanting to be suspicious.

549
00:40:29,058 --> 00:40:31,767
I don't want to be so judgmental
of humans.

550
00:40:32,225 --> 00:40:36,767
But being on that claustrophobic ship
and living on minimal supplies,

551
00:40:37,058 --> 00:40:39,600
it's normal for people
to become mistrustful.

552
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:45,142
Godzilla didn't just steal Earth
away from us.

553
00:40:45,975 --> 00:40:49,600
Justice, faith, and the basic pride
we have as humans...

554
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:52,475
we've come to lose them, too.

555
00:40:54,308 --> 00:40:57,767
And that's why
we need to fight Godzilla again.

556
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:01,767
So we can take back the dignity we lost.

557
00:41:08,642 --> 00:41:09,475
This is...

558
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:11,475
Professor! Please come!

559
00:41:13,225 --> 00:41:14,058
Over there!

560
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,017
Ruins?

561
00:41:22,683 --> 00:41:26,017
But they couldn't have lasted
10,000 years.

562
00:41:27,392 --> 00:41:28,600
Captain Sakaki!

563
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,433
I see.

564
00:41:36,808 --> 00:41:41,267
The lichen used the building's surface
as a seedbed and became fossilized.

565
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:44,475
Afterwards,
the building materials weathered away,

566
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:47,933
but the fossilized fungus
must have retained the shape.

567
00:41:48,975 --> 00:41:53,642
This is Earth's civilization.
People used to live here?

568
00:41:57,058 --> 00:41:58,058
Haruo?

569
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,392
It remembered.

570
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:08,850
Although we've forgotten,
this planet has always remembered us.

571
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:16,725
Of course. Even after undergoing change,
this is still our Mother Earth.

572
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,558
The planet that belongs to humans.

573
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:23,392
We'll take it back... no matter what.

574
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:27,100
With our own hands.

575
00:42:33,558 --> 00:42:36,725
Where's the scouting team?
Haven't they responded yet?

576
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:39,100
It's probably the electromagnetic waves.

577
00:42:39,183 --> 00:42:41,308
The reception area
is five kilometers, right?

578
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,225
Yes.

579
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:44,975
Unexpected atmospheric changes
are also possible.

580
00:42:45,058 --> 00:42:48,017
There are reports of geomagnetic storms.

581
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:51,683
But we're connected with
Martin's investigation team. It's strange!

582
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
Hey, what's that?

583
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:04,058
Is it the scouting team?

584
00:43:32,183 --> 00:43:33,017
What?

585
00:43:33,892 --> 00:43:35,392
Damn it! Kill it!

586
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:43,808
- What?
- Something happened at the camp!

587
00:43:43,892 --> 00:43:46,058
- Professor Martin!
- Let's go back, now!

588
00:44:06,017 --> 00:44:10,350
This doesn't correspond to any
of Earth's primary species records.

589
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,267
It must be a sudden variant,

590
00:44:13,558 --> 00:44:17,600
otherwise, how could something evolve
into a form like this?

591
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:21,142
Would living organisms
go through such a change,

592
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,683
even if 10,000 years have passed?

593
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:26,683
We collected
and analyzed the forest's plants,

594
00:44:27,392 --> 00:44:31,058
and by using carbon dating,
I know how much time has passed.

595
00:44:31,433 --> 00:44:35,975
And it looks to be within a 50-year range
of 19,200 years.

596
00:44:36,517 --> 00:44:39,100
So our time away keeps increasing.

597
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:44,558
The special cell characteristics of this
beast and the plants are interesting.

598
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,517
Okay, it came off.

599
00:44:50,058 --> 00:44:54,683
The flora and fauna have differences,
but also similar, wide-ranging traits.

600
00:44:55,142 --> 00:44:58,225
Along with characteristics
very similar to metal,

601
00:44:58,308 --> 00:45:01,058
they have bodily functions
that exert powerful magnetism.

602
00:45:01,475 --> 00:45:02,725
The same as Godzilla?

603
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:08,225
Yes. This beast is small, but it may be
in the same family as Godzilla.

604
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:13,517
What's surprising is that the plants also
have strikingly similar characteristics.

605
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,517
So this fog causing
the electromagnetic disturbance...

606
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:21,100
The particles in the air
are the pollen of this forest's plants.

607
00:45:21,267 --> 00:45:24,017
It could also be their natural chaff.

608
00:45:24,267 --> 00:45:27,600
If the fog's caused by the organisms
and not the weather,

609
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:31,933
we have to burn the entire forest down
to disperse this fog?

610
00:45:32,475 --> 00:45:36,475
So, we have no choice
but to abandon our first plan of waiting

611
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:39,850
for the weather to clear up a bit
before we attack.

612
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:41,142
That's not all.

613
00:45:41,392 --> 00:45:43,850
If dangerous beasts are wandering around,

614
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:46,558
I have to split up our troops
for camp defense.

615
00:45:46,642 --> 00:45:49,933
We can reassign groups
to join the special forces.

616
00:45:50,017 --> 00:45:51,142
Don't be ridiculous!

617
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:55,642
You want everyone to wander in
this unknown environment without a plan?

618
00:45:55,725 --> 00:45:57,142
Then what's your plan?

619
00:45:57,975 --> 00:45:58,808
Retreat.

620
00:46:00,142 --> 00:46:02,308
Logically, that's our only choice.

621
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:03,683
What are you saying?

622
00:46:04,433 --> 00:46:08,058
The water and plants are toxic,
and the wild animals are hostile.

623
00:46:08,142 --> 00:46:11,308
The only benefits here
are air pressure and gravity.

624
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:16,225
It'd be the height of stupidity
to fight Godzilla to reclaim this planet.

625
00:46:18,017 --> 00:46:20,642
This is our home!

626
00:46:21,517 --> 00:46:24,642
You're giving up?
Not only once, but twice?

627
00:46:25,725 --> 00:46:30,517
We can settle on the surface of the moon,
and collect resources from Earth.

628
00:46:30,642 --> 00:46:34,433
If we're thinking about safety,
it's a more realistic plan.

629
00:46:34,517 --> 00:46:38,975
Weren't you going to defeat Godzilla
and become a hero?

630
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:43,767
I underestimated the situation.
My eyes are open now and I've learned!

631
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,142
You're going to be a coward now?

632
00:46:47,058 --> 00:46:51,433
From wild beasts alone,
we have 12 dead and 35 critically injured!

633
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,350
Without even seeing Godzilla,
this is the outcome!

634
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:58,808
We can't play war with new soldiers
who've never fought in actual combat.

635
00:47:00,225 --> 00:47:01,142
Retreat?

636
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:07,017
I do agree with the commander's decision,
but the problem is, how do we retreat?

637
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,308
That attack just now

638
00:47:09,642 --> 00:47:13,392
left us with heavier equipment loss
than human casualties.

639
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,433
Is that so?

640
00:47:15,558 --> 00:47:20,517
Frustratingly, those lizard things
destroyed four landing ships.

641
00:47:20,892 --> 00:47:26,267
Ship one and two's fuel systems and
ship three and four's engines are dead.

642
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:30,142
We can't return to the mother ship
orbiting this planet anymore.

643
00:47:30,808 --> 00:47:34,225
If that's the case,
we need to gather Company A,

644
00:47:34,392 --> 00:47:39,642
and join the company with enough
transit power to get us all back to space.

645
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:44,475
Companies B and C are special forces
like us, so they can't do it.

646
00:47:44,683 --> 00:47:48,725
So we must join the artillery unit
and the trap materials unit,

647
00:47:48,808 --> 00:47:51,267
which are Companies D and E.

648
00:47:52,225 --> 00:47:57,225
In order for us to escape
the wild animals' habitat,

649
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,975
we must move through
this old Tanzawa Pass.

650
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:06,767
And our first plan was to go through
the projected encounter area for Godzilla.

651
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,975
That's correct.

652
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:15,100
We need to pass the area
where Godzilla appears frequently.

653
00:48:15,433 --> 00:48:21,475
Of course, if we run into Godzilla,
that would be extremely awful for us.

654
00:48:21,975 --> 00:48:23,892
In order to secure safe passage...

655
00:48:24,892 --> 00:48:28,142
We would need backup
from Companies B and C.

656
00:48:28,642 --> 00:48:33,850
However, if we join up and form a cluster,
we'll be open to an atomic breath attack.

657
00:48:34,642 --> 00:48:36,350
What's the safest plan?

658
00:48:37,392 --> 00:48:38,975
While remaining spread out,

659
00:48:39,058 --> 00:48:44,267
repeatedly reciprocate the threat
and keep securing each other's safety.

660
00:48:44,642 --> 00:48:49,350
Yes. This is, however, quite close
to Captain Sakaki's original plan,

661
00:48:49,808 --> 00:48:52,475
with very few changes.

662
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:59,475
Listen here.
This is a retreat tactic, no matter what.

663
00:48:59,892 --> 00:49:02,808
We will not take any action
to lure out Godzilla.

664
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:08,183
Once all units reach the gathering point,
we complete the mission,

665
00:49:08,392 --> 00:49:10,142
and return to the mother ship.

666
00:49:11,392 --> 00:49:12,975
Be careful of that crack.

667
00:49:14,517 --> 00:49:16,392
Okay, that's good. This way!

668
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:20,308
There's no fuse,
but it could still explode, so be careful.

669
00:49:20,808 --> 00:49:23,308
- That's a high explosive. Be careful.
- Yeah.

670
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:27,892
Company B, C, and all landing ships,
heading to Company D camp.

671
00:49:27,975 --> 00:49:30,308
- Confirm landing zone.
- Landing zone confirmed.

672
00:49:30,392 --> 00:49:32,850
All ships rotate bearing
to 202.5 degrees.

673
00:49:32,933 --> 00:49:34,183
- Marker lock.
- Roger.

674
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:36,683
So what's the situation?

675
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,975
Company B, Company C reserves,

676
00:49:39,058 --> 00:49:43,975
and Company A hover squads
are to join with Company D and stand by.

677
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:48,017
What's going on? Is the plan a go, or no?

678
00:49:48,558 --> 00:49:51,642
Based on Commander Leland's orders
to the hover squads,

679
00:49:51,725 --> 00:49:54,142
special forces
will abandon the base camps.

680
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:57,975
After all units reach the final
gathering point, we'll retreat.

681
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:02,642
We'll follow our original path,
but we won't search for Godzilla.

682
00:50:02,725 --> 00:50:08,725
So, what? Did we come down to Earth
just to display our marching orders?

683
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,100
Company A's damage
must have been that severe.

684
00:50:12,517 --> 00:50:15,725
I heard there were
smaller Godzilla-like creatures.

685
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:18,808
They were strong enough
to destroy a power suit.

686
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:22,975
Leland, that coward. If he's going
to go along with Haruo's madness,

687
00:50:23,058 --> 00:50:25,808
he has to resign himself
from the beginning.

688
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:30,392
They had us design this,

689
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,142
and now we have to abandon it
because of overcapacity?

690
00:50:38,517 --> 00:50:41,392
Approaching Godzilla's
projected contact area.

691
00:50:41,642 --> 00:50:44,767
Hurry! We need to
get through this area quickly!

692
00:50:49,308 --> 00:50:51,767
Can't this thing pump out any more speed?

693
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:55,100
By shifting parts around,
we got ship two moving.

694
00:50:55,808 --> 00:50:58,100
It's all we can do to keep it hovering.

695
00:50:58,558 --> 00:51:00,892
I guess I'm thankful that it's moving.

696
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,183
I wouldn't want to walk through
this forest at all.

697
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:06,975
Are you having foreboding thoughts?

698
00:51:07,808 --> 00:51:12,350
If this ends without us encountering
Godzilla, then why did I come here?

699
00:51:13,558 --> 00:51:15,683
Were you hoping to depend on luck?

700
00:51:16,267 --> 00:51:18,433
It's fine if we're actively searching,

701
00:51:18,517 --> 00:51:22,767
but if we pass by in a rush,
then we won't even find anything.

702
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:28,017
That's if we were actively searching
for Godzilla, right?

703
00:51:29,225 --> 00:51:30,600
You and Colonel Leland

704
00:51:31,183 --> 00:51:34,517
still don't understand one crucial aspect
of that thing.

705
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:38,142
It will never let humanity escape.

706
00:51:38,267 --> 00:51:42,142
Even more so if we've come to provoke it
without a trace of fear.

707
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:44,767
So, it will be searching for us?

708
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,558
Is that some divine message from god?

709
00:51:50,183 --> 00:51:51,058
It's a legend.

710
00:51:51,933 --> 00:51:56,142
We Exif have been wandering
through space as vagrants

711
00:51:56,225 --> 00:51:58,058
far longer than Earthlings have,

712
00:51:58,142 --> 00:52:01,017
and we've witnessed
many civilizations destroyed.

713
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:07,933
Many have been regretfully destroyed
by creatures similar to Godzilla.

714
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:09,225
What's that?

715
00:52:10,017 --> 00:52:13,267
He is the punishing iron hammer
for the arrogant.

716
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:17,517
For the species who pronounce themselves
as lords of creation,

717
00:52:17,683 --> 00:52:20,142
a divine avenger will pay them a visit.

718
00:52:20,767 --> 00:52:21,850
And so, he will...

719
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,350
What was that?

720
00:52:27,267 --> 00:52:28,183
An earthquake?

721
00:52:37,475 --> 00:52:40,267
Sound wave analysis!
All units, prepare for battle!

722
00:52:43,642 --> 00:52:46,642
Movement detected at two o'clock!
It's approaching!

723
00:52:55,892 --> 00:52:57,433
Evade! Evade, now!

724
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,225
We can't evade in time!

725
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:25,433
Run, Haruo.

726
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:28,725
Do as your soul cries out to do.

727
00:53:29,475 --> 00:53:30,308
Yeah.

728
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,100
The propellant is leaking!
It's going to explode!

729
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,433
Hurry!

730
00:54:31,392 --> 00:54:32,975
I'll get you for this!

731
00:54:35,933 --> 00:54:36,892
That idiot.

732
00:54:37,558 --> 00:54:38,975
Haruo, why?

733
00:54:39,475 --> 00:54:43,392
He's going to record the moment
Godzilla activates its shield.

734
00:54:43,892 --> 00:54:46,350
And to do that, you have to attack it.

735
00:54:51,058 --> 00:54:54,850
Damn it, the electromagnetic sensor
isn't responding. Why?

736
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:59,100
What are you doing? Let's go!

737
00:54:59,475 --> 00:55:01,017
But then, Captain Sakaki...

738
00:55:03,017 --> 00:55:04,308
Then, get out.

739
00:55:05,183 --> 00:55:08,225
Again! This time, at a closer distance!

740
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:12,767
Damn it!

741
00:55:12,933 --> 00:55:13,767
I see.

742
00:55:14,225 --> 00:55:17,558
Such light damage
won't cause the shield to activate.

743
00:55:17,892 --> 00:55:18,933
Professor Martin!

744
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,683
Please record this next attack
with the sensor.

745
00:55:23,017 --> 00:55:24,808
Captain! What's your plan?

746
00:55:24,892 --> 00:55:28,017
I'm going to nose-dive
and slam into it.

747
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:29,392
What?

748
00:55:35,767 --> 00:55:38,600
You bastard, I will...

749
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:51,433
What?

750
00:56:09,808 --> 00:56:11,725
This planet can go to hell.

751
00:56:23,975 --> 00:56:24,808
Leland.

752
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,600
Colonel Leland was killed?

753
00:56:51,892 --> 00:56:56,850
Yes. According to rank,
the command will now fall to me, though...

754
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:58,183
Can you do it?

755
00:56:58,517 --> 00:57:03,392
I'll need to reassign a subordinate
who has disobeyed military regulations.

756
00:57:03,475 --> 00:57:05,975
This is an emergency,
so please understand.

757
00:57:06,642 --> 00:57:10,350
For this occasion, fine.
Bring back as many people as you can.

758
00:57:10,808 --> 00:57:11,808
Understood.

759
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:17,975
Did you analyze the data sent to us?

760
00:57:18,058 --> 00:57:19,183
Finished just now.

761
00:57:19,808 --> 00:57:22,433
The electromagnetic metamaterial's
output has been recorded.

762
00:57:22,808 --> 00:57:25,600
Just as you surmised, a shield exists.

763
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,558
The noise in question was confirmed.

764
00:57:29,142 --> 00:57:31,100
It's not unified across its body.

765
00:57:31,183 --> 00:57:33,267
There's clearly a concentrated spot.

766
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:34,267
The dorsal fin?

767
00:57:34,725 --> 00:57:39,392
This is where the shield is generated.
Leland gave his life for this information.

768
00:57:41,683 --> 00:57:47,017
Everyone, during that earlier encounter,
Colonel Leland died an honorable death.

769
00:57:48,142 --> 00:57:51,808
And so,
as the Central Committee's direct priest,

770
00:57:52,142 --> 00:57:55,058
I have accepted full responsibility
for this operation.

771
00:57:56,017 --> 00:58:00,350
However, I cannot say that I am
the best man for this job.

772
00:58:01,808 --> 00:58:06,267
All people are born to accomplish the task
they were meant to do.

773
00:58:07,433 --> 00:58:10,058
This has been established
in our scriptures,

774
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:15,225
and as I shoulder the burden of a priest,
I cannot turn my back to this truth.

775
00:58:16,183 --> 00:58:20,183
With the premise
of taking full responsibility,

776
00:58:20,808 --> 00:58:23,350
I will now entrust all decision-making...

777
00:58:25,558 --> 00:58:27,767
to Captain Sakaki, as the commander.

778
00:58:29,475 --> 00:58:31,558
Okay, Haruo.

779
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:33,475
Your orders.

780
00:58:33,767 --> 00:58:34,850
But that's insane!

781
00:58:47,183 --> 00:58:50,350
The situation is dire,
so I'll skip the pleasantries.

782
00:58:51,225 --> 00:58:55,225
I don't have an outlook
for humanity's future,

783
00:58:55,683 --> 00:59:00,475
and I don't have enough of a strategy
to estimate our chances of winning.

784
00:59:01,392 --> 00:59:03,392
However, I can say this.

785
00:59:04,683 --> 00:59:08,808
Those who didn't yield to Godzilla
can proudly welcome another day.

786
00:59:09,933 --> 00:59:12,975
This is not only a battle
to kill Godzilla.

787
00:59:14,308 --> 00:59:17,517
What we are about to fight
is a humiliating future

788
00:59:17,975 --> 00:59:21,267
with no choice
but to accept despair and resignation.

789
00:59:22,558 --> 00:59:29,142
If we can reject and fight that,
we can once again dream of hope and pride.

790
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,433
Just as our ancestors did,
who thrived here before us.

791
00:59:34,183 --> 00:59:37,767
That's right. If we don't retreat now,
if we don't show fear,

792
00:59:38,017 --> 00:59:41,600
and if we put our lives on the line,
we've already won.

793
00:59:42,225 --> 00:59:44,225
All we need to do is finish it.

794
00:59:45,308 --> 00:59:49,475
Humanity's 22-year-long nightmare,
and Godzilla's 20,000-year era.

795
00:59:52,392 --> 00:59:55,683
I look forward to your brave efforts.
That is all.

796
01:00:07,392 --> 01:00:08,975
We'll begin our operation.

797
01:00:09,058 --> 01:00:11,683
Yuko, you know Godzilla's position, right?

798
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:14,975
Yes.
It's about 80 kilometers north-north-east.

799
01:00:15,058 --> 01:00:17,683
Moving southwest
at 40 kilometers an hour.

800
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:21,475
Set up transmission balloons
every 3,000 meters on the battlefield.

801
01:00:22,058 --> 01:00:24,392
- We need optimal communicative reception.
- Roger.

802
01:00:24,475 --> 01:00:28,475
Major Belu-be, provoke Godzilla
from a distance and watch its reaction.

803
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,142
Maintain that distance.

804
01:00:30,392 --> 01:00:31,725
Sure, leave it to me.

805
01:00:32,142 --> 01:00:34,058
Adam, watch for the atomic breath.

806
01:00:34,225 --> 01:00:36,475
If electric potential rises,
escape immediately.

807
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,433
Understood.

808
01:00:37,975 --> 01:00:38,808
Galu-gu.

809
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:42,892
I'll move to the trap point
and command the power suit team directly.

810
01:00:43,142 --> 01:00:43,975
What?

811
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:48,433
I'll determine the EMP probes'
target point on-site.

812
01:00:48,975 --> 01:00:50,058
However...

813
01:00:50,475 --> 01:00:52,683
Galu-gu, how are the trap placements?

814
01:00:52,767 --> 01:00:54,392
All according to plan.

815
01:00:54,475 --> 01:00:56,933
Its weak point is the dorsal fin,
its back.

816
01:00:57,058 --> 01:01:00,308
Since we need to concentrate our fire
at a close distance,

817
01:01:00,392 --> 01:01:05,433
we have to let it pass the line of fire,
and lure it deeper into the valley.

818
01:01:06,058 --> 01:01:07,808
So we only have one chance.

819
01:01:07,933 --> 01:01:12,267
To make this plan work, we need
to place the traps deeper in the valley.

820
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:25,017
Artillery units are all in position.

821
01:01:25,392 --> 01:01:26,225
We're ready.

822
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,350
Can we really lure it
all the way out here?

823
01:01:29,433 --> 01:01:32,225
We have no choice but to believe in them.

824
01:01:35,433 --> 01:01:38,933
Power suit team, move to the trap point.
We'll stand by.

825
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:43,433
I'm leaving the diversion to you, Belu-be.

826
01:01:43,975 --> 01:01:44,808
Roger.

827
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:50,850
All squads, ascend to planned altitude.
Cross-delta pattern formation.

828
01:02:02,392 --> 01:02:04,600
Godzilla detected
at the projected contact area.

829
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:07,808
All units, commence the diversion plan.

830
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,683
Right wing, squad one, attack!

831
01:02:12,808 --> 01:02:14,517
Godzilla sighting confirmed!

832
01:02:14,725 --> 01:02:15,558
Fire!

833
01:02:18,517 --> 01:02:19,475
All units, turn!

834
01:02:29,183 --> 01:02:32,850
Ascend in battle formation.
We'll attack as long as possible!

835
01:02:41,392 --> 01:02:43,183
Target successfully diverted.

836
01:02:43,558 --> 01:02:44,767
We can do this!

837
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:49,683
Evade!

838
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:57,600
Damn it! Adam! Take the left wing!

839
01:02:57,767 --> 01:02:59,392
Roger, left wing, squad one.

840
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:02,433
- The impact area is bigger!
- It's hard to evade!

841
01:03:02,517 --> 01:03:05,933
The evading maneuvers
are just a second delayed. Let's go!

842
01:03:15,517 --> 01:03:18,517
- Right wing, squad two, follow and attack!
- Roger!

843
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:33,683
These guys aren't part of the plan!

844
01:03:34,225 --> 01:03:35,058
What's wrong?

845
01:03:35,142 --> 01:03:37,517
Major Belu-be!
It's what attacked Company A!

846
01:03:38,225 --> 01:03:41,808
What? All squads provide cover fire
from a higher altitude.

847
01:03:42,183 --> 01:03:45,142
Shoot them down
before more come from the forest!

848
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:51,392
Left wing, squad two, counterattack!

849
01:04:04,267 --> 01:04:06,225
We have no time for the small fish.

850
01:04:06,558 --> 01:04:09,225
Left wing, squad two,
continue the diversion!

851
01:04:20,433 --> 01:04:21,850
Belu-be, are you okay?

852
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,892
It seems like you're in trouble.

853
01:04:23,975 --> 01:04:28,225
Like the simulations predicted,
we should be able to lure it to the spot.

854
01:04:28,308 --> 01:04:29,767
But we need more firepower.

855
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:32,725
It'll be night soon.
Can you hasten the process?

856
01:04:32,975 --> 01:04:36,225
Ten have gone down.
Ammo and gas are almost depleted.

857
01:04:36,683 --> 01:04:37,975
Adam. Do you copy?

858
01:04:38,767 --> 01:04:40,642
Yes. Captain, I copy.

859
01:04:41,142 --> 01:04:43,558
- I'm reassigning you.
- What, right now?

860
01:04:43,642 --> 01:04:46,600
I'm shortening the time allotted
to lure Godzilla.

861
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:48,808
What? How can we do that?

862
01:04:49,475 --> 01:04:53,058
I'll use the landing ships
for a bombardment to create a path.

863
01:04:53,142 --> 01:04:55,725
What? Send the landing ships
to the frontline?

864
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:56,975
It's too dangerous.

865
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:00,517
If they get shot down,
how will we return to the mother ship?

866
01:05:00,892 --> 01:05:02,517
But we're already home.

867
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:07,392
There's nowhere else to return to
but here. Isn't that right?

868
01:05:08,225 --> 01:05:09,767
Have you lost your mind?

869
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:10,975
Let's do it.

870
01:05:11,308 --> 01:05:14,142
It'll be useless
to prepare an escape route.

871
01:05:14,642 --> 01:05:17,392
In order to win,
we need to play every hand.

872
01:05:18,142 --> 01:05:21,433
This is why belligerent species
are difficult to deal with.

873
01:05:21,808 --> 01:05:26,475
Adam, select five elite pilots.
Prepare the landing ships for takeoff.

874
01:05:26,808 --> 01:05:27,725
Roger.

875
01:05:27,808 --> 01:05:31,392
Major Belu-be, Second Lieutenant
Adam Bindewald, withdrawing!

876
01:05:31,808 --> 01:05:34,558
Hurry and go! We'll handle this somehow!

877
01:05:35,517 --> 01:05:37,642
Right wing, squad one, charge again!

878
01:05:40,892 --> 01:05:42,517
Don't fall behind!

879
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:57,183
Six elite pilots, standing by!

880
01:05:57,725 --> 01:05:58,933
We can go anytime!

881
01:05:59,017 --> 01:06:01,267
Load all ammunition, even the reserves.

882
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:02,767
If we mess up, that's it.

883
01:06:03,058 --> 01:06:03,892
Roger!

884
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:05,975
All landing ships, depart!

885
01:06:06,642 --> 01:06:10,683
Starting from Godzilla's position,
create a path until the signal is given.

886
01:06:11,558 --> 01:06:13,267
Fire at will, if you must.

887
01:06:13,392 --> 01:06:15,850
Eliminate any obstacles in its way.

888
01:06:17,225 --> 01:06:18,892
Commencing final diversion.

889
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:22,683
This is the point of no return.
We'll end this, now.

890
01:06:23,725 --> 01:06:27,975
Listen up, the landing ships' mobility
can't evade an attack in time.

891
01:06:28,058 --> 01:06:30,767
Once you know you're targeted,
abandon ship!

892
01:06:31,058 --> 01:06:32,850
Captain, you're being lavish!

893
01:06:33,475 --> 01:06:37,308
Hover squads, save ammo until
the route is open. Minimize losses.

894
01:06:37,767 --> 01:06:41,433
Roger. We're almost out of gas.
So there's no second chances!

895
01:06:43,558 --> 01:06:44,392
Turn!

896
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:54,183
The landing ships are almost here!

897
01:06:54,267 --> 01:06:56,600
Spread out to avoid the bombardment!

898
01:06:58,975 --> 01:07:02,933
All ships, drop the thermobaric bombs!
Scatter all that you have!

899
01:07:13,392 --> 01:07:16,017
All landing ships, disperse! Spread out!

900
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,475
So who drew the short straw?

901
01:07:24,933 --> 01:07:25,850
It's me, huh?

902
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:43,725
Okay! Godzilla is on the diversion path!

903
01:07:43,975 --> 01:07:47,683
Now! All hover squads,
fire everything you have! This is it!

904
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:51,892
Roger! All squads, resume the diversion!
Increase attack frequency!

905
01:07:58,308 --> 01:07:59,142
Damn it!

906
01:08:00,933 --> 01:08:03,058
It's no good! I can't speed up!

907
01:08:06,392 --> 01:08:09,267
All squads! Join the left wing!
Just a little more!

908
01:08:11,683 --> 01:08:13,100
Diversion is in progress.

909
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:16,100
Godzilla is accelerating
toward the trap point!

910
01:08:16,183 --> 01:08:18,058
Haruo, please hurry and board.

911
01:08:18,142 --> 01:08:19,017
Yuko!

912
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,142
Why are you here?

913
01:08:20,683 --> 01:08:22,975
I've always been on the power suit team.

914
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:26,267
Do you understand?
This is practically a suicide mission!

915
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:28,392
I want to become stronger!

916
01:08:29,767 --> 01:08:32,558
That's what I thought when Grandpa died.

917
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:37,392
Godzilla entering Tanzawa Pass.
Only 500 meters to the trap point.

918
01:08:51,058 --> 01:08:53,392
Damn it, I'm running out of gas!

919
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,558
Keep provoking it
and lure it to the last point.

920
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,892
Stay calm, this is the critical moment.

921
01:09:00,183 --> 01:09:02,308
Trap point arrival, 100 meters!

922
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:09,267
You will return Earth to humans.

923
01:09:10,142 --> 01:09:11,558
Fifty more meters!

924
01:09:12,433 --> 01:09:14,725
Damn, I can't stand this.

925
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:19,392
At times like this, I'm jealous of those
who have a god to pray to.

926
01:09:26,933 --> 01:09:28,100
All units, disperse!

927
01:09:30,225 --> 01:09:31,225
Ten meters!

928
01:09:34,683 --> 01:09:36,392
Godzilla is at the trap point!

929
01:09:37,308 --> 01:09:38,392
Set off the trap!

930
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,225
Trap detonation complete!

931
01:09:53,725 --> 01:09:56,392
Godzilla's movement stopped.

932
01:09:57,517 --> 01:09:59,392
Did we succeed in capturing it?

933
01:10:06,725 --> 01:10:09,558
Artillery unit, begin concentrated fire!

934
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,933
Asymmetrically permeable shield,
generated!

935
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:25,017
All gun ports, synchronized attack!

936
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:28,225
Body surface electromagnetic pulse
alignment sync at 75%!

937
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:31,433
At 75%? Is the pattern changing?

938
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:35,308
Alignment incomplete.
Unable to predict shield collapse!

939
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,183
Damn it, we can't attack like this.

940
01:10:38,517 --> 01:10:40,225
Search for the noise. Hurry!

941
01:10:40,558 --> 01:10:44,475
Noise detected.
The next shield collapse is in 20 seconds.

942
01:10:44,975 --> 01:10:45,933
Twenty seconds?

943
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:47,725
Will the restraints hold?

944
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:55,767
Sync at 100%.

945
01:10:56,225 --> 01:11:00,142
Detecting resonance with noise wave!
Shield collapse in ten seconds!

946
01:11:07,392 --> 01:11:09,475
Artillery unit, fire!

947
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:14,892
If we can destroy the dorsal fin...

948
01:11:16,683 --> 01:11:18,308
The shield is dropping!

949
01:11:18,892 --> 01:11:21,058
Electric potential rising!
It's an atomic breath!

950
01:11:23,558 --> 01:11:24,683
It can still attack?

951
01:11:26,392 --> 01:11:29,225
The tissue on Godzilla's back
is regenerating!

952
01:11:29,558 --> 01:11:31,475
The shield will be restored.

953
01:11:31,975 --> 01:11:34,267
Shield will be up in about 200 seconds!

954
01:11:34,558 --> 01:11:36,808
The restraints are no longer holding!

955
01:11:37,683 --> 01:11:38,517
Damn it.

956
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:40,267
I'll finish this!

957
01:11:41,933 --> 01:11:43,058
Haruo!

958
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:51,725
- What is he...
- With a close-range EMP attack,

959
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,850
he'll disrupt the noise pattern.

960
01:11:58,183 --> 01:12:00,767
The pulse is changing. It's syncing again!

961
01:12:01,475 --> 01:12:03,933
The next shield collapse
is in ten seconds!

962
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:07,392
Don't worry about me!
Destroy the rest of the dorsal fin!

963
01:12:07,683 --> 01:12:08,808
But then you'll...

964
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:11,100
Doesn't matter! Fire!

965
01:12:11,892 --> 01:12:13,725
The shield is now collapsing!

966
01:12:16,475 --> 01:12:18,808
Fire! Fire until the gun barrel burns up!

967
01:12:23,267 --> 01:12:24,850
The shield is dropping!

968
01:12:25,225 --> 01:12:27,017
Okay, power suit unit, attack!

969
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:43,975
The EMP probes are entering its body!

970
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:53,308
All units, retreat! Retreat!

971
01:13:04,225 --> 01:13:06,558
Electromagnetic concentration
in the air, rising!

972
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:09,892
It didn't work?

973
01:13:10,308 --> 01:13:14,017
It did, the electromagnetic waves
are running wild inside it.

974
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:26,433
You bastard, I have...

975
01:13:29,058 --> 01:13:31,350
killed you!

976
01:13:47,267 --> 01:13:49,558
He really did it.

977
01:14:48,683 --> 01:14:49,517
Haruo!

978
01:15:03,517 --> 01:15:05,600
Look at this.

979
01:15:08,308 --> 01:15:09,808
This body structure...

980
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:13,933
Yeah. Indeed a monster.

981
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:18,142
You've accomplished it, Captain.

982
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:21,850
Because everyone believed in
and supported me,

983
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,350
I could be so daring and get this far.

984
01:15:25,517 --> 01:15:30,392
Even though we defeated it...
What was it, really?

985
01:15:30,975 --> 01:15:33,642
How was it able to live for 20,000 years?

986
01:15:35,225 --> 01:15:36,642
This is just my opinion,

987
01:15:37,183 --> 01:15:41,808
but I think this is a different Godzilla
than the one that drove us from Earth.

988
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:47,225
But its appearance and abilities
were almost identical.

989
01:15:47,308 --> 01:15:50,975
And that's exactly why.
Life's true nature is found in change.

990
01:15:51,475 --> 01:15:54,683
No matter how gradual
the renewal cycle may be,

991
01:15:54,975 --> 01:15:58,392
it's impossible to maintain
the exact same appearance.

992
01:15:58,892 --> 01:16:03,350
So this one may be an offspring
that inherited Godzilla's form and nature.

993
01:16:03,558 --> 01:16:06,475
Such a guess would actually
be the most natural.

994
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:11,767
Although the question remains
of why there was only this one. Also...

995
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:15,975
So, there's no guarantee
only one of them survived.

996
01:16:16,433 --> 01:16:20,433
I apologize if what I'm saying
spoils the victory, but that is correct.

997
01:16:21,308 --> 01:16:26,392
That's fine. Thanks to this battle,
we proved that we can defeat Godzilla.

998
01:16:26,975 --> 01:16:30,308
Even if another one shows up,
we have nothing to fear.

999
01:16:31,267 --> 01:16:35,808
Since we've established a valid strategy,
we can be more effective next time.

1000
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:40,683
Personally, I would never want to cross
a tightrope like that ever again, though.

1001
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:44,683
What was that?

1002
01:16:45,725 --> 01:16:47,725
Did anyone measure the vibration?

1003
01:16:47,808 --> 01:16:49,767
I'm picking it up on this sensor!

1004
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:53,642
Find the origin using Gematoria analysis.

1005
01:16:53,725 --> 01:16:54,558
Yes, sir.

1006
01:16:55,183 --> 01:16:59,100
No, it can't be. Is the meter damaged?

1007
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:02,058
- What is it?
- It's within two kilometers?

1008
01:17:02,142 --> 01:17:03,183
It's nearby!

1009
01:17:03,308 --> 01:17:04,433
That's ridiculous!

1010
01:17:04,517 --> 01:17:07,475
Electric potential, rising.
The numbers are unbelievable!

1011
01:17:07,558 --> 01:17:09,725
They are far greater than Godzilla's!

1012
01:17:09,808 --> 01:17:11,350
Underground heat source...

1013
01:17:11,558 --> 01:17:14,642
Wait, a plasma reaction? This can't be!

1014
01:17:47,808 --> 01:17:48,975
What's happening?

1015
01:18:03,558 --> 01:18:04,392
Is that...

1016
01:18:10,308 --> 01:18:11,308
Wh-What is that?

1017
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:12,683
Godzilla?

1018
01:18:12,933 --> 01:18:15,433
Height over 300 meters and rising.

1019
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:19,975
Surface vibroscope estimates a mass
of about 100,000 tons.

1020
01:18:22,558 --> 01:18:24,558
This is impossible!

1021
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:44,350
Can that be a living creature?
Unbelievable!

1022
01:18:44,767 --> 01:18:49,017
No, according to the rules
for living creatures, this is correct.

1023
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:50,475
Professor?

1024
01:18:50,558 --> 01:18:55,558
Indeed, the changing form of life
isn't just about decay.

1025
01:18:56,517 --> 01:19:02,600
If it continued its life activity
for 20,000 years, growing earnestly...

1026
01:19:03,975 --> 01:19:06,642
When those fleeting lives destined to die,

1027
01:19:06,725 --> 01:19:09,642
forget their humbleness
and sing praises of their glory,

1028
01:19:10,058 --> 01:19:13,225
such will shake the very heavens
and split the earth,

1029
01:19:13,308 --> 01:19:15,767
and they shall know the wrath
of the divine.

1030
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:18,433
The inevitable incarnation of destruction.

1031
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:23,642
So, you show yourself at last.

1032
01:19:24,225 --> 01:19:28,850
Since we last saw each other, it has been
20 years for us and 20,000 years for you.

1033
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:32,558
It's been a while...

1034
01:19:33,725 --> 01:19:35,267
Oh, King of Destruction.

1035
01:19:43,933 --> 01:19:47,350
All landing ships, take off immediately!
Emergency retreat!

1036
01:19:47,683 --> 01:19:49,392
But we're still withdrawing!

1037
01:19:49,475 --> 01:19:53,225
Just take whoever's already onboard
before that thing attacks us!

1038
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,267
Everyone, do whatever it takes
to get far away from here! Hurry!

1039
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:41,642
What's that? A super oscillatory wave?

1040
01:20:41,725 --> 01:20:45,975
Estimated electric output
is measuring over 900 gigawatts.

1041
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:47,183
Damn it!

1042
01:20:47,808 --> 01:20:49,267
What do you intend to do?

1043
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,642
I'll divert its attention!

1044
01:20:51,808 --> 01:20:53,892
I'll buy time so people can run!

1045
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:56,183
You don't think that'll work, do you?

1046
01:22:06,808 --> 01:22:11,433
You bastard... I will...

1047
01:22:12,134 --> 01:22:17,134
