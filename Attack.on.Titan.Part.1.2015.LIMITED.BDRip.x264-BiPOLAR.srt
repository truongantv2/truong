00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:18,185
<i>Over 100 years ago,</i>

3
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,979
<i>Titans suddenly appeared</i>

4
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,899
<i>and devoured most of humanity,
decimating civilisation.</i>

5
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:27,778
<i>The survivors built</i>

6
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,197
<i>three massive concentric walls</i>

7
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,908
<i>to prevent another Titan invasion,</i>

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,744
<i>and managed a peaceful life inside.</i>

9
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,328
Eren!

10
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,289
Chill out.

11
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,582
It's a dud bomb.

12
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,792
This blue thing must be the ocean.

13
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,836
<i>So it was real.</i>

14
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:46,255
I wonder if that bird

15
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:47,506
has seen the ocean.

16
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:48,841
Born inside the Wall,

17
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,009
and dying inside it...

18
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:51,635
You're fine with that?

19
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:53,095
We're starting a scout.

20
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,307
Once we find new land,
we're free to live anywhere.

21
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,017
<i>Everyone knew</i>

22
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:00,853
<i>that this peaceful life</i>

23
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:07,651
<i>was only a prologue
to that sound of despair.</i>

24
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:10,071
So they're real.

25
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,994
<i>I once saw the end of the world.</i>

26
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:22,833
<i>It was a bloody,
ugly and loud kind of hell.</i>

27
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,839
<i>Where did they come from,
and where are they headed?</i>

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,674
Mikasa!

29
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:38,140
<i>At the edge of hell, Eren lost Mikasa.</i>

30
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,435
<i>Promises trampled upon.</i>

31
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,355
<i>Futures snatched away.</i>

32
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,108
<i>Dreams chewed to shreds.</i>

33
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:51,487
<i>Yet we never abandoned
our last strand of hope.</i>

34
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,531
In order to reclaim our farmlands,

35
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,075
we must restore the broken Outer Wall.

36
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,701
This, we vowed!

37
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,830
We detonate this portion to plug that hole.

38
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,540
That's the mission.

39
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,209
<i>Even the Scout Regiment was wiped out.</i>

40
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,420
If we fail, it'll be the end of humanity.

41
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:12,007
Now we have omni-directional mobility gear!

42
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,177
<i>Humanity decided to confront
its doomed future.</i>

43
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:16,762
Give your hearts!

44
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:20,432
<i>Will there be light at the end of darkness?</i>

45
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,935
<i>No one wished for conflict.</i>

46
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,729
<i>Titans are not invincible.</i>

47
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,357
<i>If the nape is severely damaged,</i>

48
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,484
<i>it will perish without regenerating.</i>

49
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:34,905
<i>We were saved by Captain Shikishima,
the Titan-slaying hero.</i>

50
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,324
Wouldn't mind a hot Titan chick for once.

51
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,910
<i>And at his side</i>

52
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,288
<i>was Mikasa.</i>

53
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,248
<i>The world is cruel.</i>

54
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,916
<i>I'm just going to kill Titans.</i>

55
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,628
<i>Seeing a completely changed Mikasa,</i>

56
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,548
<i>Eren was confused and heartbroken.</i>

57
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,217
Will you be father to my daughter?

58
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,802
Hiana!

59
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,431
I want to defeat the Titans.

60
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,807
Then go fly.

61
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,144
<i>The true enemy</i>

62
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,480
<i>isn't the Titans,</i>

63
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,608
it's safety.

64
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,945
<i>Overwhelmed by the waves
of attacking Titans...</i>

65
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,031
- The explosives. That was it!
- Don't!

66
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,658
<i>...the troops helplessly ran.</i>

67
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,953
I won't let you die here!

68
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,208
<i>Eren was eaten.</i>

69
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,585
<i>Our task is still to kill Titans.</i>

70
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,254
<i>You can't! You're almost out of gas!</i>

71
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,924
<i>Our extinction was only a matter of time.</i>

72
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,135
<i>Or so it seemed.</i>

73
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,222
<i>I'm driving you all out.</i>

74
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,146
A Titan attacking a Titan?

75
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,819
His fighting clearly
demonstrates intelligence.

76
00:03:56,237 --> 00:04:01,408
<i>Revenge will never fill
the gaping hole in one's heart.</i>

77
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,453
I've never seen this!

78
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,664
<i>We only lose ourselves.</i>

79
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,207
Is he on our side?

80
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,917
Like hell he's on our side!

81
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,835
<i>Hearts are stirred.</i>

82
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,920
Eren?

83
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,131
Cut open his nape.

84
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,425
The cells will assimilate!

85
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,596
<i>Where did they come from?</i>

86
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,598
<i>Where are we headed?</i>

87
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,395
<i>Without fighting, we can't win.</i>

88
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,605
<i>Which of us</i>

89
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,733
<i>will survive?</i>

90
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,582
This will sting a bit.

91
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,632
Good boy.

92
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,768
You did that to your own son?

93
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,853
Dear, we already tested on our first child.

94
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:58,650
I want to identify what triggers
explosive cell divisions.

95
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,944
You call yourself a father!

96
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:04,907
Open the door.

97
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:12,956
Open it!

98
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,834
Open up, professor.

99
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,337
Open up!

100
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,173
- Take care of Eren.
- I will.

101
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,808
Quite a library.

102
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,397
Professor, how did you manage
to collect so many books?

103
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,566
We've been purging them for 100 years.

104
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,319
Don't!

105
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,658
- Please!
- You violated the law.

106
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,992
Let go!

107
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,245
- Stop!
- Be quiet!

108
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,299
Foolish!

109
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,594
Don't you think?

110
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:51,972
People, I mean.

111
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,726
For ages, the world saw no end to wars.

112
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,022
There was a desire
to become stronger, richer.

113
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:06,320
To that end, people built weapons,
made scientific advancements

114
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,114
and expanded their knowledge.

115
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,913
Do you think that ever led
to the end of conflicts?

116
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,419
There were some who said then,

117
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:28,342
"Humanity will unite when
a common enemy appears."

118
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,304
Over 100 years ago,

119
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,765
that common enemy actually appeared.

120
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,018
The Titans!

121
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:44,983
Faced with extinction,
our forefathers built the Walls

122
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,111
and trapped themselves inside.

123
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,823
But that turned out to be a blessing.

124
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:57,412
People preciously shared
the limited land, food and resources.

125
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,624
Conflicts disappeared
as everyone became equal.

126
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,879
By binding themselves, people found

127
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,466
that their hearts became richer.

128
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,429
And by restricting

129
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,475
the knowledge and technology
at the root of conflict,

130
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,312
we managed to secure
eternal peace, at last.

131
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,818
But what happens if there's
a human who can become a Titan?

132
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,489
I ask you,

133
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,702
are you a human? Or a Titan?

134
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:47,546
Are you a human or a Titan?
I asked you a question.

135
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,513
I'm human.

136
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:06,189
Humans don't regenerate limbs
that have been ripped off.

137
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,081
Everyone witnessed him

138
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,710
become a Titan and then emerge

139
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,629
out of the Titan.

140
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,840
I said I'm human!

141
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,134
Tell him, guys!

142
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,183
I'm human, right?

143
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,445
Where's Captain Shikishima?

144
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,574
He needed to report on how
the last explosives were lost,

145
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,328
so I sent him back to the Middle Wall.

146
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,539
Too bad for you.

147
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,585
Shoot him.

148
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,671
Wait!

149
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,439
Eren is human.

150
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,775
He's on our side.

151
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,903
We saw him annihilate
all the Titans in the area.

152
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,446
I see...

153
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:44,246
I can defeat the Titans.

154
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,041
With all the personnel we've lost,

155
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,294
our mission needs to bet on Eren!

156
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:56,299
Eren is humanity's last hope.

157
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,635
Director General, I'm against it, too.

158
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,388
He's an invaluable test subject!

159
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,015
He's a Titan with intellect!

160
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,476
This might solve the mystery.

161
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,688
Now I can perform a vivisection! Yes!

162
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,231
Hey, hey...

163
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,150
Then how do we plug the hole?

164
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:18,905
Without explosives,
there's no way to demolish the Wall.

165
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,909
No, there's a way!

166
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,673
Chill out, it's a dud bomb.

167
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,341
The dud bomb!

168
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,843
Tell me more!

169
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,848
Enough with your stalling tactics.

170
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,559
You kids are renegades.

171
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,687
Renegades?

172
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,486
This belonged to one of your friends, no?

173
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,073
Director General, that belonged
to the bomb thief.

174
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,952
The central government has known
for some time

175
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:10,665
that forces have been
plotting against the regime.

176
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,170
The enemy is after our weapons.

177
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,633
Hey, stop! Stop!

178
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:23,804
And as feared,

179
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:28,892
it turns out that the renegades
have infiltrated us.

180
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:36,399
We must nip evil in the bud

181
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,737
before it flowers.

182
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:49,830
Don't! What will your
siblings do if you die?

183
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:55,669
Mikasa.

184
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,046
What's the matter?

185
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,217
Are you going to let Eren die?

186
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,579
Fine, then shoot!

187
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,295
I've already given my heart to the cause!

188
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:39,713
Armin!

189
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,263
You're a coward, old fart!

190
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,933
No courage to even bet on me!

191
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,686
Showing your true colours, now.

192
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:01,026
Born inside these Walls,
I thought my life was meaningless!

193
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,534
Eren.

194
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,665
But now I'm beginning to see
what I'm capable of.

195
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:22,172
So just don't get in my way, please!

196
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,474
Even you, Squad Leader?

197
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,061
That monster tried to devour you.

198
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,897
It wasn't his fault!

199
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,153
After some time,
the cerebral cortex breaks down,

200
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,906
and his consciousness
is overtaken by instinct.

201
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,699
Later, his body's cells

202
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,243
are assimilated with the Titan's...

203
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,753
- Mr Souda!
- Old man!

204
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,975
A drunkard spewing nonsense.

205
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,149
Eren...

206
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,784
Your older brother...

207
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,317
Fire!

208
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,619
I've never seen this! Another one!

209
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,580
Come on, get serious!

210
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,874
Director General!

211
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,251
With Director General dead,
I'm taking command!

212
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,211
Cease fire!

213
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,424
His skin is different.

214
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,151
Eren!

215
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,987
He's a precious test subject! Save him!

216
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:02,332
He defended himself.
This one has intellect, too!

217
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,459
Wait, wait a second!

218
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,169
You guys!

219
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,893
That's useless!

220
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:13,862
ATTACK ON TITAN

221
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,924
Mr Souda...

222
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:36,926
What was he trying to say?

223
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,603
From Omotemachi here, we'll go
to Monzen to get the bomb,

224
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,771
then head to the Outer
Wall to plug the hole.

225
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,608
Let's go!

226
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,988
You still think we can plug the hole?

227
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,494
We're the only ones left!
And where do we get explosives?

228
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,790
You heard him earlier,
there's a bomb in Monzen.

229
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,667
Isn't that right, kid?

230
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,087
You're gonna trust that kid?

231
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,506
And going with this small group?

232
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,135
I'm going! I came here to plug that hole.

233
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:22,680
We can't let all those
casualties go to waste.

234
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,643
It's impossible! I'm not going.

235
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,313
Then go home.

236
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,694
If you can get home alone
past all those Titans.

237
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,748
Move.

238
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,754
You guys better not slow me down.

239
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,130
Deal.

240
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,385
Let's hurry before the Titans spot us.

241
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,179
You, Mikasa?

242
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,561
Mikasa.

243
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,481
Let's go home to Monzen.

244
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,194
Can we go home?

245
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:20,863
We can.

246
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,666
I guess you'll need me to survive.

247
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,837
Now we're talking, c'mon.

248
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:39,716
Which leaves...

249
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,760
That bastard probably went
home to his Titan buddies.

250
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,388
Eren isn't friends with Titans.

251
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,559
Then why didn't that Titan eat him?

252
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,061
Well...

253
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,905
Why do the birds go on singing

254
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,827
when it's the end of the world?

255
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,373
Captain...

256
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,384
That's the song.

257
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,971
Why do the birds sing?

258
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,727
Because they know

259
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,397
that the Wall isn't the end of the world.

260
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:50,239
Where is this?

261
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:05,796
I came across the Titan that grabbed you.

262
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,342
And I saved you.

263
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:16,933
The Titan got away, though.

264
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,649
Thank you.

265
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,237
Now watch.

266
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,698
This is how our world works.

267
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,475
Shocked?

268
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,938
Titans are in fact humans.

269
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:08,150
Titans are... human?

270
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,737
Created by humans, no less.

271
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:19,078
If this wasn't evolution,
maybe it was about creating weapons.

272
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,624
But over 100 years ago,

273
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,960
it spun out of control,

274
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,254
spawning hordes of Titans.

275
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,218
A large number of people became Titans.

276
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,354
No one knew who'd become a Titan.

277
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,817
Guess what happened.

278
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,698
People began to distrust and then
kill one another, self-destructing.

279
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:05,374
This place, was once a metropolis.

280
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,097
Those who couldn't become Titans
walled themselves in,

281
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:26,479
and were soon split between
the few rulers and the many ruled,

282
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:30,024
giving birth to this
fine world we now live in.

283
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:33,694
And this place?

284
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,075
Apparently there are
several rooms like this.

285
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,412
This is where government
officials monitor us

286
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:46,082
while surrounded by banned relics

287
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,752
of what they consider a shameful past.

288
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:55,883
"Abandon

289
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,220
"what you would protect,
then you will be strong."

290
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,765
That's what he told me.

291
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:08,854
Having lost everything,
I even abandoned my memories.

292
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,107
I see...

293
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,446
Now you're a Grim Reaper to the Titans.

294
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,493
I've got too many things to protect.

295
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:32,378
Ten o'clock, I see Titans!
There's about

296
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,964
eight or nine of them!

297
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:36,757
Movements are normal.

298
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,552
Normal? Dammit, so boring.

299
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,975
I really don't want to die.

300
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,476
Um...

301
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:54,650
Captain Shikishima is your life saver,

302
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,403
and your mentor, and

303
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,697
is that all?

304
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,837
The Wall falling two years ago
was convenient for the government.

305
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,007
What happened at that time?

306
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:25,389
They were about to begin scouts.

307
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:28,559
Correct, people had forgotten
the fear of Titans,

308
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,353
and their loyalty to the state had waned.

309
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:36,859
Information, residence,
even childbirth was regulated.

310
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,280
And when people tried to go
outside the Wall, what happened?

311
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,374
- The Titans came.
- Precisely.

312
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,046
Too convenient, no?

313
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:03,219
Thus, the people's hatred
was directed at the Titans.

314
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:10,559
But think of how many people died!

315
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,062
Unfortunately, it's true then and now.

316
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:20,486
Countless workers died in
the name of restoring the Wall.

317
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:28,202
I can't get the sight of those who
were eaten by Titans out of my mind.

318
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:36,001
How long is this going to continue?

319
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,048
Do you think the state's serious
about fixing the Wall?

320
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,222
You're saying these expeditions
are pointless? Then why?

321
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,015
You don't know?

322
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,352
You must know.

323
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,816
They need sacrificial victims.

324
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:03,279
To instil the fear of Titans
across generations.

325
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,408
To ensure no one would ever
want to go beyond the Wall.

326
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,535
To squash the brave.

327
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,747
That's not right!

328
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:18,627
Then... let's bring it to an end.

329
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,135
I've been waiting for you.

330
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:28,512
For me?

331
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,145
Unlike the other cattle, you retain
your intellect even as a Titan.

332
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,355
This is evolution.

333
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,816
A new kind of human.

334
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,945
You were chosen, you see.

335
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:51,285
We'll end the days of slavery
and create a new world.

336
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,916
Don't betray the hero within you.

337
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,840
Hero?

338
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:48,550
But wait...

339
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:52,721
It's just you and me doing this?

340
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,556
You're not confident?

341
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:56,892
Well...

342
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,563
Follow me.

343
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,124
Why'd you volunteer?

344
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,584
As an inland guy, you didn't need to.

345
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,840
We have a "Titan" at home.

346
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,969
With a huge attitude.

347
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,264
Nothing I did was ever good enough
for my asshole dad.

348
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,811
At least you have a dad.

349
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,604
That's not good enough!

350
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,317
- As long as you have one.
- I don't need one!

351
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:49,695
This will work, right?

352
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:00,497
Look!

353
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,257
- Is that...
- The dud bomb.

354
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:15,888
I'm home.

355
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:32,446
Be alert, we're now entering Titan habitat.

356
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,082
Formation!

357
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,380
They're like-minded comrades.

358
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,299
The Scout Regiment!

359
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,343
I thought they died...

360
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,430
You're awfully gullible.

361
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:04,436
I faked their deaths,
and we got the army's explosives.

362
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:23,789
Any Titans?

363
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,458
Four in the distance, headed east.

364
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:28,877
Not a problem, then.

365
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,216
Never seen these weapons.

366
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:38,220
They're from before the Titan War,
secretly stashed here by the state.

367
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:42,683
They're ineffective against Titans,
but they work on people.

368
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,646
It's for the government to aim at people.

369
00:35:58,115 --> 00:35:59,575
We're not cattle.

370
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:05,080
Exactly, you are your own master.

371
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,802
Don't you miss it?

372
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,431
This is your hometown.

373
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,256
By the way,
I heard there's still a bomb left.

374
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,640
Ready? I'm tossing it.

375
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,941
- Done on this side.
- I'm tying it down.

376
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,361
I'm gonna pull it.

377
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,821
OK, can you hold it?

378
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,282
- Is this really necessary?
- Jean, hurry.

379
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:24,868
Shut up, I know.

380
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:28,247
OK, done.

381
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,334
- This one?
- Hurry.

382
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,669
I know, I am!

383
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,337
How does this work?

384
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,092
Hurry, before the Titans come.

385
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,095
But how do we get this on the Wall?

386
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,472
We're going to do it together.

387
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,101
If only Eren were here.

388
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,602
Even if he were here,

389
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,022
would he even listen to humans?

390
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,251
Here.

391
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,693
Hey!

392
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:24,339
Hey! No way!
Isn't that a pre-Titan War gun?

393
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:28,969
Lemme see! It's an MGL!
How'd you get your hands on an MGL?

394
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,846
Mikasa!

395
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,098
Eren!

396
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,435
- Eren!
- Eren!

397
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:42,149
Sorry to worry you.

398
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,281
Captain saved me.

399
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:59,458
Good, you saved us the trouble
of digging this up.

400
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:10,010
Captain, who are these fellows?

401
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,138
Hope for our future, I guess?

402
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,724
Oh, one more thing,

403
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,059
what's this cargo?

404
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,061
A guided surface-to-air missile.

405
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,146
I knew it!

406
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:25,317
A pre-war weapon that can hit
even moving targets with precision.

407
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:29,446
Not only that, it has the power
to lead us to victory.

408
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:31,823
Feel free to look.

409
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,244
Yes! Oh, wow, there's an RDS...
Holy crap!

410
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,417
Comrades!

411
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,127
The time has come.

412
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:48,215
We will requisition this large bomb.

413
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,887
We must now rise against the government.

414
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,432
Together with the power
to change the world,

415
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,518
we will return inland.

416
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:00,894
Inland?

417
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:05,607
The Walls we must destroy are there.

418
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,193
What did you say?

419
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:09,903
The Inner Walls.

420
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,656
But then the Titans will enter.

421
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:15,742
They'll storm in like an avalanche.

422
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:20,455
That's the aim! With our weapons and
the large bomb you dug up,

423
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:24,709
we will destroy both Inner Walls,
allowing the Titans to enter.

424
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,254
The current regime will topple.

425
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,257
We have more supporters inside.

426
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:35,136
When the two Walls fall,
we shall rise in revolt,

427
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:37,639
beginning humanity's revolution.

428
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:41,977
What do you think?

429
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:43,520
Not bad, right?

430
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,148
And he's already on board.

431
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,319
Wait, I haven't heard this.

432
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:55,657
The explosives are for
fixing the Outer Wall!

433
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,998
What? You don't want this?

434
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,918
Those are the selfish people you despise.

435
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:13,008
But they're just normal people,
they didn't do anything.

436
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,801
Exactly, they did nothing.

437
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,138
They've been cattle for over 100 years.

438
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:21,308
Enabling this evil system
is criminal enough.

439
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:25,645
As long as they're around,
nothing will change.

440
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:31,943
Even so, no one deserves to die!

441
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:35,989
Listen to you.

442
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:39,743
Just listen to you.

443
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:53,548
Your own hands were tainted
when you killed those Titans.

444
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:58,678
They were just innocent people, too.

445
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,687
Are you all content with this world?

446
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:13,109
You have no freedom to know,
to live, to bear children!

447
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,237
Let's fight this rule!

448
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,657
Join us!

449
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:20,909
Huh?

450
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:22,952
The enemy is not the Titans.

451
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,498
It's the government, using fear to rule.

452
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:29,751
With those bombs,
we can end this false peace.

453
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,253
Now is the time to decide!

454
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,347
Like I told you,

455
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:47,268
you can only gain by letting go.

456
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:50,814
I...

457
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:53,316
<i>The world is cruel.</i>

458
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:56,277
<i>Eren is humanity's last hope.</i>

459
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,279
<i>Will you be father to my daughter?</i>

460
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,240
<i>There was a guy who abandoned his girl.</i>

461
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,867
<i>Once we find new land,
we're free to live anywhere.</i>

462
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,452
<i>Are you a human?</i>

463
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:05,620
Mister.

464
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:06,788
Help!

465
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:08,206
<i>That baby was eaten.</i>

466
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,457
<i>Trying to save yourselves...</i>

467
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,126
Take care of him.

468
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,630
<i>Eren...</i>

469
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,267
I won't...

470
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,146
I won't abandon

471
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:33,648
anyone else!

472
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,024
What did you say?

473
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:41,531
I won't let you use the bomb
for something like that.

474
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,703
Never!

475
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:48,955
How?

476
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,252
Whatever it takes!

477
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,511
What do you see in this guy?

478
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:06,848
You can't beat me.

479
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,225
Do you know why?

480
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:22,989
Because you've always blamed something.

481
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:27,160
The Wall, the times, the world...

482
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,546
Always making excuses.

483
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:44,803
You make me laugh!

484
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,390
Don't like it? Turn into a Titan.

485
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:07,408
Thought you'd be a useful weapon,
but I miscalculated.

486
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:22,924
You don't know anything about me.

487
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,928
Your ex-girlfriend told me.

488
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:28,429
That's enough!

489
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:31,933
I see.

490
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:34,060
You feel pity

491
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,062
for your first love.

492
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,792
You ingrate.

493
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:04,465
Get away from Mikasa!

494
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:07,093
Still don't get it?

495
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:10,096
You have nothing.

496
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:18,313
Don't you touch her with
those filthy hands!

497
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:35,955
Can't we do something?

498
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,254
Maybe we can...

499
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,343
Or maybe not.

500
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,484
Playing with you

501
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:06,569
has gotten boring.

502
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,008
Who was that?

503
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,719
Wasting precious food...

504
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:36,307
Don't move!

505
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:40,853
If I press this,

506
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,231
this bomb will explode!

507
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,317
If you move, this whole area will blow.

508
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:49,570
Guys, hurry.

509
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:54,367
You OK?

510
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,830
Idiot!

511
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:00,832
Think anyone would believe that?

512
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,918
I designed this detonator.

513
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:05,795
I did!

514
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:08,297
Is that right?

515
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:11,259
Then you have my permission.

516
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,344
Blow this whole place up.

517
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:24,147
Pity, so it was a lie.

518
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:34,657
What now?

519
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,038
- Sannagi!
- Armin, go!

520
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,539
But...

521
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,249
Hurry, go!

522
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,020
Stupid strength.

523
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:05,688
Make him stop!

524
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:12,737
Sannagi!

525
00:51:57,365 --> 00:52:01,702
That fool! What will his siblings do?

526
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:19,387
Hey...

527
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,312
Good work, you guys.

528
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,065
That was impressive.

529
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:32,817
But it's all over.

530
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:41,075
I can at least destroy
the Middle Wall with this.

531
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:43,244
By yourself? How?

532
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:45,788
I'll show you

533
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:50,084
who the truly chosen one is.

534
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:56,132
This is the correct way

535
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,929
to give your heart.

536
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,278
Armin, go!

537
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,779
Everyone, hold on!

538
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:48,976
Don't tell me...

539
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:53,981
The strongest man as the strongest Titan?

540
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:56,234
This is hell.

541
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:01,822
Did you know?

542
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:05,743
But I didn't...

543
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:10,248
I'll handle him.

544
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:12,833
You guys fix the Wall!

545
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:20,341
Gimme a break!
Is this really going to make you a Titan?

546
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,343
I dunno, but I have to do it!

547
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,845
You're not the only one here!

548
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:30,017
As long as we've kept fighting,
we haven't lost!

549
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,437
We're doing this together!

550
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:43,864
That's...

551
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:52,206
You were always with me.

552
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,014
Here they come.

553
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:19,567
He's coming.

554
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:49,388
Man, he's strong.

555
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,520
But he's still only got two arms and two eyes!
Aim for the seams!

556
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,731
We'll attack all at once.

557
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,233
Let's go!

558
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,631
Mikasa!

559
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,725
He's blind on the left!

560
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:53,077
I'll finish him!

561
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:57,331
You're mine!

562
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:04,004
Move!

563
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:08,843
Eren!

564
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:11,595
Eren!

565
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,056
He died for me...

566
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:46,547
You're going down!

567
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:52,386
Pity, we could've saved the world together.

568
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:55,616
Did he lose?

569
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:01,789
Always remember the final blow.

570
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:39,994
Too slow.

571
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:43,789
You're the one who's slow.

572
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:46,584
I see!

573
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,168
Go, Eren!

574
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:12,610
He did it!

575
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:44,850
Remember this bomb?

576
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,396
I need you to put this
into the crack up there.

577
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:55,069
Huh, so you speak human?

578
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:01,075
Dammit, quiet down, you idiot!

579
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,412
To be safe, I'll only
attach this timing device

580
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,664
up there.

581
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:09,875
Handle it with care!

582
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,005
OK, let's go.

583
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:02,469
He's starting to weaken.

584
01:02:21,155 --> 01:02:23,991
Push it in here, right here.

585
01:02:35,169 --> 01:02:36,170
Eren...

586
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:55,063
- Eren!
- Eren!

587
01:02:58,525 --> 01:02:59,985
Not now!

588
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,404
- Wake him up!
- How?

589
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,406
Pierce the nape without killing Eren.

590
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:06,033
Only Mikasa can do it!

591
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,013
Not in the middle!

592
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,400
Mikasa!

593
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:48,992
Phew, I'm saved.

594
01:03:53,372 --> 01:03:56,375
Pre-war military vehicles sure are sturdy.

595
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:07,362
Eren!

596
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:09,865
Eren!

597
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:12,075
Eren!

598
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:16,830
Eren.

599
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:19,374
Wake up.

600
01:05:30,052 --> 01:05:31,178
You promised.

601
01:05:33,305 --> 01:05:34,431
You promised me.

602
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:36,642
The ocean.

603
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:38,977
I wonder if that bird

604
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:40,938
has seen the ocean.

605
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:42,189
<i>Wanna see it?</i>

606
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,493
Don't worry, Armin's on it now.

607
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,874
Sasha, can you hold that side?

608
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,545
Like this?

609
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:51,675
Once this is on...
OK, it'll detonate in five minutes.

610
01:06:53,135 --> 01:06:54,261
Let's get away.

611
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:00,892
You OK?

612
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:17,743
Well done, getting this far.

613
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:21,413
Truly beyond my imagination.

614
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:26,168
As heroes who restored the Wall,

615
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:31,298
you shall be treated
like nobles inland, for life!

616
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:35,594
But that's only if you
hand over your Titan friend

617
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:41,266
and continue to defend the Wall!

618
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:45,312
No, thanks!

619
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:50,067
Think we'd sell Eren for that?

620
01:08:01,495 --> 01:08:02,746
- Armin!
- Armin!

621
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:13,507
Fools!

622
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:17,511
What in the world could you want?

623
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,972
I want to know the truth about this world!

624
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:22,933
What would you do?

625
01:08:24,476 --> 01:08:27,729
People can't handle the truth!

626
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:34,528
They would've been happier inside
the Wall, not knowing anything!

627
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:38,490
That's why you were protected by the Wall!

628
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:42,244
You need the Wall!

629
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:47,290
It's hell outside the Wall!

630
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:49,793
I'd rather be free in Hell

631
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:53,547
than a slave in Heaven!

632
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:57,592
You sure?
Outside there's nothing to rely on!

633
01:08:58,218 --> 01:08:59,344
At least inside...

634
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:07,435
Sasha!

635
01:09:38,884 --> 01:09:40,302
Sasha, get back!

636
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:46,933
- It can't be...
- The Director General?

637
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:51,104
Governing with fear.

638
01:09:57,027 --> 01:09:59,196
Trying to keep us from plugging the hole.

639
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:03,575
Give me the ODMG and the gas tank.

640
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,299
I've waited for this day!

641
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:31,144
Damn, he's hot!

642
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,023
Hold on tight.

643
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,818
Don't freak out.

644
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:57,379
Let's go, Eren!

645
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:02,259
Don't you dare touch the bomb!

646
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:07,013
Jean!

647
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,853
Damn you!

648
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,401
Armin, get up!

649
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:32,163
Eren!

650
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,167
Eren, no!

651
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:55,478
Look what they had!

652
01:12:31,765 --> 01:12:32,849
It's almost time.

653
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:49,699
Eren, get away!

654
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:54,454
You'll die!

655
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:58,708
Don't be stupid.

656
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,586
This is revenge for Jean

657
01:13:02,796 --> 01:13:05,965
and for everyone!

658
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:09,677
But the bomb...

659
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:14,099
It's time.

660
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:33,576
Hey!

661
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,845
- It didn't explode.
- Something went wrong.

662
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,607
I'm going.

663
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:07,026
Mikasa!

664
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,699
Can you hit the bomb with that?

665
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:16,911
Hit the fuse to trigger it.

666
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:19,664
- Here I go...
- Wait.

667
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:24,544
Mikasa!

668
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:27,672
So close.

669
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:41,728
What to do...

670
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:43,897
Too bad.

671
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:51,654
Just strike the fuse.

672
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,574
You'd blow up, of course.

673
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:11,591
Please. Don't take it away.

674
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:16,763
Each time we take the Wall down,
they'll build it back up.

675
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:21,226
Just to save their pathetic selves.

676
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:28,566
What about you?

677
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:38,952
What about your wall?

678
01:16:08,273 --> 01:16:09,899
Take this!

679
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:02,619
I admire your guts, but this prey is mine!

680
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,085
You've got your own future to live.

681
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:14,881
Eren.

682
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:38,321
The Director General is blown to bits.

683
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:39,781
But what about the Wall?

684
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:41,074
Not a problem!

685
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:45,411
The first explosion will vaporize the halogen,
boron, etc., leading to a second...

686
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:46,579
Boom!

687
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:49,582
There it is!

688
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:07,183
Look at that!

689
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:13,833
Are you OK?

690
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:28,264
The hole...

691
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:30,016
It's plugged...

692
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:31,684
Yes!

693
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:38,900
Look.

694
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:00,523
Now it begins.

695
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,800

706
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:51,824

01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:52,291
This is a surprise

723
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:59,298
It appears two subjects
escaped from the test zone.

724
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:05,971
It's the unpredictability
that keeps it interesting.
