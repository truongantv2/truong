1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033


2
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,240
Yes, hello?

3
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,880
My name is Nase Izumi.

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,080
Nase? The Nase?

5
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,320
Yes.

6
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,410
I'm calling with some news for you.

7
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,780
Kuriyama Mirai-san?

8
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
Pleased to meet you.

9
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,900
I'm Nase Izumi.

10
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,780
This is Kuriyama Mirai.

11
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,030
A spirit hunter and legitimate successor of the cursed bloodline.

12
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,630
Do you mean the clan that is
shunned by most spirit hunters?

13
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,540
Yes.

14
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,330
Kuriyama-san.

15
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,530
She can use her own blood as a weapon.

16
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,650
Not only can it be hardened, it can also be used as a lethal poison that erodes bodily tissue.

17
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,070
Will that be enough?

18
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,900
It's hard to say.

19
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,150
But I believe she stands a very good chance.

20
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,810
Isn't the target said to be immortal?

21
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,280
Yes.

22
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,880
Immortal?

23
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,510
In truth, he's just terrifyingly quick to recover,

24
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,710
but he's known to the spirit hunters
around here as the "immortal half-shade."

25
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,590
The immortal half-shade?

26
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,210
Let me show you.

27
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:25,520
\hUnlike shadelings, he's half human and half shade—a preposterous and dangerous being.

28
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,310
My research showed me that his shade half resembles the shade beyond the horizon.

29
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,720
My younger brother attempted to kill this fellow
but had the tables turned on him.

30
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,930
He nearly died from his injuries.

31
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,400
You're the only one I can count on.

32
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,990
Please.

33
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,660
This is the shade from beyond the horizon?

34
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,860
Sorry for dragging you along to
that stifling meeting back there.

35
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,490
It may be because of this area's long history, but we have certain customs.

36
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,820
Bonsai?

37
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,960
Yes.

38
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,240
Um, that aside...

39
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,150
What?

40
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,090
Where's this shade from beyond the horizon?

41
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,540
Rest assured.

42
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,530
He's under constant supervision.

43
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,640
I'll have to kill him sooner or later, right?

44
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,320
Then I'd prefer it to be sooner.

45
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,850
Can you?

46
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,520
How should I know?!

47
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,820
You had no idea either—

48
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,820
That's not it.

49
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,100
I'm asking you if you're mentally prepared for this.

50
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,670
The half-shade's name is Kanbara Akihito.

51
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,600
Suicide.

52
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:56,200
Defined in the dictionary as "the act of taking one's own life,"

53
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,080
it's something I will probably never even think about doing.

54
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,030
Not because I think it's unethical,

55
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,580
but for a more fundamental reason.

56
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,240
However, let's save that for later.

57
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,500
Right now, she's about to die.

58
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,240
At least, it seemed like that to me.

59
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,540
At this point the story can proceed in one of two ways.

60
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,200
Either the protagonist plays an active role in the events that unfold,

61
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,140
or he takes a passive role as the story moves on without him.

62
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,690
By all accounts, I'd fall into the latter category,

63
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,980
but for some reason, I chose the former option at this time.

64
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,820
H-Hey!

65
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,580
I won't repeat everything I said, but...

66
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,170
"...at any rate, someone who looks as good in glasses as you

67
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,630
simply must not die!"

68
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,000
That was my heartfelt plea to her.

69
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,220
I finished by screaming out everything I felt at that moment.

70
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,510
"Basically, I love glasses!"

71
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,390
How unpleasant.

72
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,030
You—

73
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,150
You picked a fight with the wrong person.

74
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,720
Hey, uh...

75
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,750
Think you could at least do something about this sword?

76
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,710
Please?

77
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,620
And that's how I met Kuriyama Mirai.

78
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,870
If our story had ended after a meeting like that,

79
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't think any story in this world would be worth telling.

80
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,360
Beyond the Boundary

81
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,040
Did she give up?

82
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,880
Where did you even come from?!

83
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,950
Take this!

84
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,460
Hey, we can't go around destroying buckets!

85
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,320
Jeez!

86
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,470
I think it's about time we put an end to this.

87
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,850
What is this, a horror movie?

88
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,960
E-Everything's dark!

89
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,940
What'd you do to me?!

90
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,140
It's just a bucket.

91
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,280
Are you hungry?

92
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,950
What's the big deal?

93
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,160
It's not like you lose anything!

94
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,520
Of course I do!

95
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,290
You keep chipping away at what's left of my heart!

96
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,690
I told you I still feel pain, didn't I?!

97
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,850
Do you have any idea how much it hurts?

98
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,120
Doing whatever you please to us immortals
is just discrimination!

99
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,470
People are going to hear you, you know.

100
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,960
It's fine.

101
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,640
I already made sure no one else was around.

102
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,680
Thanks for waiting.

103
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,520
Here are your extra burrito, mole poblano, and chili con carne combos.

104
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,980
Enjoy yourselves.

105
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,880
You ordered even more food?!

106
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,730
You're being unpleasant.

107
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,280
I'm the one who's finding this unpleasant!

108
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,960
Not only do you practice on me,

109
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,010
you even have the nerve to mooch off me for dinner!

110
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,380
Mooch?

111
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,160
I thought we had a deal.

112
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,160
I'd refrain from challenging you to any more fights tonight, and in exchange,

113
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,920
you'd treat me to dinner.

114
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,400
So that means you're going to attack me again tomorrow, I take it?

115
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,110
Why wouldn't I?

116
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,600
Kuriyama-san!

117
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,750
Are you alright?

118
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,670
I'm fine.

119
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,760
Just a little anemic.

120
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,520
I was using my blood, after all.

121
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,940
Let's take this to Ayaka-san tomorrow.

122
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,440
I'll come pick you up in the morning.

123
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,210
You shouldn't get too close to me.

124
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,140
I've unleashed powers I normally keep in check.

125
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,910
Immortal or not, you don't want to touch my blood right now.

126
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,870
We still have to do something about that bleeding.

127
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,950
Give me your hand.

128
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,500
I'll do it myself.

129
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,920
Come on.

130
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,850
Kuriyama-san, you haven't joined a club yet, have you?

131
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,100
I don't have time for that.

132
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
I can't interest you in the Literature Club?

133
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Why do you ask?

134
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,350
Because I'd love for a beauty with glasses to join.

135
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,860
How unpleasant.

136
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,710
Well, it's the club I'm in,

137
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,360
and we only have two real members right now.

138
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,820
Oh, and the other one's a spirit hunter too,

139
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,840
so I'm sure it'd work in your favor professionally as well.

140
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,310
I'll have to pass.

141
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,000
Huh? Why?

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,250
I don't want to associate with other people...

143
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,140
I guess his immortality really can't
be dealt with using normal methods.

144
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,760
Yes.

145
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,870
You should observe him for a while.

146
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,690
Attacking him haphazardly won't get you anywhere.

147
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,230
But...

148
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,810
In time, his shade half is sure to surface again,
as it did against Hiro'omi.

149
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,390
Use that opportunity.

150
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,610
Okay.

151
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,350
Also...

152
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,570
Let me offer you a warning.

153
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,680
You'd be better off keeping
your distance from Akihito-kun.

154
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,560
Oh, right.

155
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,410
Kuriyama-san.

156
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,420
Y-Yes?

157
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,350
Remember what we talked about yesterday? How about it?

158
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,300
I want to invite her to come visit the Literature Club. Is that okay?

159
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,590
She says she hasn't joined any clubs,

160
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,540
and there aren't many other spirit hunters at our school.

161
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,800
Besides, she only just got here—

162
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,930
I thought I refused already.

163
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,730
I'm scared.

164
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,370
I'm terrified of taking lives.

165
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,940
Then why don't you quit being a spirit hunter?

166
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,430
If I could...

167
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,860
If I could, I would've done so a long time ago!

168
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
I tried to quit!

169
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,070
I tried to quit being a spirit hunter,

170
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,200
quit killing dreamshades,

171
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,040
and live a normal life!

172
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,290
But this cursed blood flowing through my veins is anything but normal.

173
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,180
This power of mine...

174
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,420
The same goes for me.

175
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,350
Why would you say that?

176
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,320
Why...

177
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,110
You're an investigator from the Spirit Hunter Association's Observation Bureau?

178
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,170
That's right.

179
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,270
I'm Fujima Miroku. Nice to meet you, Nase Izumi-san.

180
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,370
So, what is your business here?

181
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,710
The Hollow Shadow.

182
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,000
Dreamshades this powerful don't show up too often,

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
so I'm here to observe it.

184
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,250
Dreams mark the way to the underworld.

185
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:04,010
And we call the darkness that lies within them "dreamshades," masses of human resentment

186
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,060
brought to life by the twisted human heart and all of its hatred, envy, and aggression.

187
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,370
Dreamshades will continue to exist as long as humans do.

188
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,270
So long as we can see them, we will continue to kill them.

189
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,740
Doesn't that make you feel like spirit hunting thrives on the misery of others?

190
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,780
I see you have some interesting views on the subject.

191
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,490
How so?

192
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:33,630
Having descended from a long line of spirit hunters
that have been fighting shades since antiquity,

193
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,840
I see shades the same way a farmer sees rice,

194
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,240
or a fisherman sees fish.

195
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,650
It doesn't matter what they are.

196
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,120
I see.

197
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,570
May I ask you something?

198
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,550
Go ahead.

199
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,050
What are dreamshades to you?

200
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,060
That goes without saying, doesn't it?

201
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,060
Monsters, nothing more.

202
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,060
Do I...

203
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,230
look like a normal person...

204
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,970
to you?

205
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,070
In my eyes,

206
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,580
you're nothing but a bespectacled beauty.

207
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,000
What... the...

208
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,430
The Hollow Shadow?

209
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,940
Kuriyama-san...

210
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,600
Hurry up...

211
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,820
And stab me!

212
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,700
It's in a weakened state right now, isn't it?

213
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,580
Chase it out of my body and you'll be able to finish it off!

214
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,030
But you'll...

215
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,130
I won't die.

216
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,620
I'm immortal, after all.

217
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,210
I won't last much longer.

218
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,550
Hurry up!

219
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,590
B-But...

220
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,970
Isn't this what you came here to do?

221
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,360
Didn't you come here telling yourself you had to do this?

222
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,470
Y-Yes, but...

223
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,770
Then don't falter now!

224
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,780
Killing it won't change anything.

225
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,220
Not the blood flowing through your veins, nor the position you find yourself in.

226
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,110
It won't change a single thing!

227
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,400
But you still came here!

228
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,490
So finish the job!

229
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,860
Don't give in to the Hollow Shadow!

230
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,910
Otherwise everything you've done
will have been in vain!

231
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,700
Stab me!

232
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,870
I'm immortal.

233
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,710
So...

234
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,320
So...

235
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,710
live on!

236
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,870
Senpai...

237
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,390
Unleash your blood.

238
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,720
Goodbye.

239
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,390
Senpai...

240
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,370
Hold it.

241
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,410
Stay back.

242
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,090
What's wrong with you?

243
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,970
You went up against the Hollow Shadow, you know?

244
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,030
Didn't you realize this was going to happen?

245
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,600
Forgive me.

246
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,250
I can't guarantee you'll survive this.

247
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,480
I know.

248
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,160
You know that Kanbara-kun's a half-shade, don't you?

249
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,130
When his body falls into a perilous state,

250
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,410
his shade half awakens.

251
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,790
Basically, this is big trouble.

252
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,660
Sen... pai...

253
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,130
The cage!

254
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,920
He can negate our spirit powers.

255
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,010
Ayaka-san!

256
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:33,710
I know.

257
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,060
Oh no!

258
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,700
No way.

259
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,160
Nino-san!

260
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,930
This'll only hold him for a little while.

261
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,950
Now's our chance!

262
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,360
This isn't working!

263
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,050
He's going to break out!

264
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,710
Do I...

265
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,670
look like a normal person...

266
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,920
to you?

267
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,760
The same goes for me.

268
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,880
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,240
I didn't understand a thing about you,

270
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,860
and yet I...

271
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,860
I have to stop you.

272
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,650
Kuriyama-san?

273
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,120
I did it again...

274
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,400
She's...

275
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,270
Senpai.

276
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,020
Sorry.

277
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,380
I'm so sorry!

278
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,330
King of Chinese

279
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,330
Thanks for the food!

280
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,140
Slow down and savor it.

281
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,590
I feel like I don't have nearly enough blood!

282
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,480
I need to replenish my iron.

283
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,960
Besides, I can't believe this isn't the Hollow Shadow,

284
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,240
Or that it's only worth 200 yen!

285
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,590
I don't think Ayaka-san would lie, though.

286
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,550
Then what's going on?

287
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,310
How would I know?

288
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,040
Aren't you going to eat?

289
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,150
Nah.

290
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,350
Where are you going?

291
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,290
The restroom.

292
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,210
Hey...

293
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:34,540
Yes?

294
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,790
Do I look like a normal person to you?

295
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,550
Let's see...

296
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,970
In my eyes, you're nothing but an
ill-mannered guy who's obsessed with glasses.

297
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,100
What the heck?

298
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,580
I've given it some thought since then.

299
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,500
I realized I shouldn't hesitate

300
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,510
\hand that I have to defeat Senpai—
the shade from beyond the horizon.

301
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
But I...

302
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:37,560
I don't want to kill Senpai.

303
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,020
I don't want to... kill him.

304
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,360
I heard that the lull doesn't
actually begin until midnight,

305
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,120
but for some reason, I sense tension in the air.

306
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,460
It's more stagnant than tense, if you ask me.

307
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,590
Lull, eh?

308
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,880
The name fits perfectly.

309
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,380
I should probably walk home
with my little sister right now.

310
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,090
She's long gone, though.

311
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,260
Why?!

312
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,090
Because she doesn't want to
walk home with you.

313
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,230
Why?!

314
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,470
Because she hates you.

315
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,540
Why?!

316
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,180
Because you keep acting like that all the time!

317
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,410
Senpai, I'd better hurry or I won't make it in time for the supermarket's packed meals sale!

318
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,270
Oh, okay.

319
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,020
Later!

320
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,620
Akkey.

321
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,720
Don't take this lightly.

322
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,860
I'm feeling strangely nervous.

323
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,330
Sounds like love.

324
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,090
Want a ride?

325
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,350
I'll give you one.

326
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,100
A lull, huh?

327
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,730
Why are you here?

328
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,860
I figured we could talk a bit while I drive.

329
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,610
Is that a dreamshade?

330
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,770
Yes.

331
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:27,120
Just like the Hollow Shadow, there are many powerful shades that lack a physical form.

332
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:34,000
They say this shade was born from all the resentment shown by humans over the years.

333
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,730
It is an entity formed from accumulated malice.

334
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:43,210
Apparently it'll lead the world to ruin
if left alone, or something.

335
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:50,650
This dreamshade, said to be the cause of disease, war, and natural disasters,

336
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,190
is also commonly referred to as "the one beyond the horizon."

337
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,410
Thankfully, only a fraction of it has shown up so far—

338
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,660
not enough to be harmful.

339
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,700
Why would you tell me this?

340
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:09,000
We believe you Nases have the information we need, but you aren't very willing to share.

341
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,720
So I thought I'd try to get it from you.

342
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,990
Looks like they haven't told you anything, though.

343
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,220
Yakiimo.

344
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,800
It's the truth!

345
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:27,230
So, what is being done about this shade from beyond the horizon?

346
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,650
Do you mean to tell me we Nases have been preparing in secret?

347
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,400
Do you want to know that badly?

348
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,620
Does Kuriyama-san have anything to do with
the shade from beyond the horizon?

349
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,160
Beats me.

350
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,750
But it would be amusing if it did,

351
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,460
don't you agree?

352
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,130
Bro!

353
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,970
Oh dear.

354
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,520
You tailed your little sister all the way here?

355
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
It's almost like you have a thing for her.

356
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,260
How you wound me.

357
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,040
The "almost like" part was unnecessary!

358
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,660
What are you after?

359
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,370
Ask your little sister.

360
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,670
Onii-chan!

361
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,260
That was a wonderful display of love for your brother.

362
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,270
Wh-What the heck?

363
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,240
Akihito-kun was run over...

364
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,570
...so why isn't he hurt?

365
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,670
Huh?

366
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,330
Oh, well...

367
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,530
Don't kill us!

368
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,820
Please, don't kill us!

369
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,760
Why would you say that?

370
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,430
Izumi-san?

371
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,600
You must be worn out.

372
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,150
Why are you here?

373
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,530
Get some more rest.

374
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,100
Thank you for riding with us today.

375
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,100
This is Hananodera Station.

376
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,500
Please make sure you have all your belongings.

377
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,510
The obvious conclusion is that the lull's taking its toll on him.

378
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:08,770
But I have a feeling that it severely weakened
not only his shade half, but also his human half.

379
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,560
Isn't there any way to make him better?

380
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,980
If he were human or shade,
there'd be several things we could do.

381
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,880
But Kanbara-kun's a half-shade.

382
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,110
Frankly speakin', he's such a rare creature that I have no idea how to treat him.

383
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,500
Senpai...

384
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,000
How long have Kanbara-senpai and Mirai known each other?

385
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,840
Well, I don't know all the details,

386
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,250
but they met around when
Mirai-chan came here, I think.

387
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,510
It's almost time.

388
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,600
Stay alert, Ai.

389
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,430
Okay.

390
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,430
Thank you.

391
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,700
I was lost in thought.

392
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,810
It's okay.

393
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,760
That aside, Kanbara-senpai...

394
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,270
I'm sure they'd let you stay by his side so long as you ask.

395
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,090
But it's not like I could do anything.

396
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,150
Even so, you want to stay with him.

397
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,100
W-Well...

398
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,550
How unpleasant.

399
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,830
You don't really mean it when you say "how unpleasant."

400
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,610
How unpleasant.

401
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,800
You meant it this time.

402
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,750
How can you tell?

403
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,470
Nobody can stop you from staying by Kanbara-senpai's side if you want to.

404
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:31,140
I-It's not about staying by his side.
Nothing like that.

405
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,910
I... just...

406
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,020
He loves glasses.

407
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,700
Like I said, it's not like that!

408
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,810
It's just...

409
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,940
I feel normal around him.

410
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,800
I'm part of a clan with a cursed bloodline.

411
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,700
I've got these abnormal powers.

412
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,900
But he makes me feel normal.

413
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,950
He always has, right from the day we met.

414
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,360
That's good to hear.

415
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,960
I'm glad you met him.

416
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,340
How unpleasant.

417
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,470
Now that one you didn't mean.

418
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,670
Izumi-san!

419
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,180
Senpai?

420
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,180
He's escaped.

421
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,230
I wonder how Akihito's shade half took over.

422
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:11,860
Ayaka-san told me while he was passed out that his human half had also grown extremely weak.

423
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:20,120
It must've become even weaker than his impaired shade half.

424
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,130
And as a result, his shade half
ended up taking over?

425
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,140
Yes.

426
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:31,010
That would explain why he wasn't as strong as usual back there.

427
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,010
So he escaped instead.

428
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,390
I'm sorry!

429
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,520
"No. 135"?

430
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:53,400
She clearly possesses that
special something unique
to all bespectacled
beauties, but her
expression's too
forced and unnatural.

431
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:53,400
Final Score: 83%

432
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,560
"Final Score: 83%."

433
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,880
"She clearly possesses that special something unique to bespectacled beauties,

434
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,120
but her expression's too forced and unnatural."

435
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,660
How unpleasant.

436
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,420
Did you see those boxes over there?

437
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,760
H-He's a pervert!

438
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,930
It's depressing to see one of the rare half-shades turn out to be like this.

439
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,710
I don't think someone who breaks into apartments should be passing judgment on others.

440
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,000
But this is too much!

441
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,390

Kuriyama-san's

468
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,570
Kuriyama-san's
Birthday

469
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,560
How unpleasant!

470
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,400
That text you sent me...

471
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,820
Is it true?

472
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,000
Yes.

473
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,280
The lull should impair all dreamshades, even the one from beyond the horizon.

474
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,660
If you use all of your blood and your entire body,

475
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:50,540
you'll be able to draw out Akihito-kun's
dominant shade half without killing him.

476
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:56,340
However, that means the shade beyond
the horizon will invade every last inch of you.

477
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,470
But that'll save Senpai, right?

478
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,220
You've already made your decision, haven't you?

479
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,390
I have.

480
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,560
This is where Akihito-kun is.

481
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,370
He'll wake up eventually.

482
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:14,310
If you truly wish to save him, go there as soon as you can.

483
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,580
Kuriyama-san.

484
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,330
Akihito-kun wants you to live on.

485
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,860
He wants you to kill him and live on.

486
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,190
I'm certain he feels that way.

487
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,830
I guess so.

488
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:34,210
You're still going to save him despite that?

489
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:34,840
Yes.

490
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,340
I'm sure he'll be upset with me.

491
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:44,400
If he finds out I did something like this,
he'll say that I don't understand anything.

492
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,040
Just like he did back then.

493
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,900
Serves him right!

494
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,330
Senpai!

495
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,620
Hello?

496
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,080
Where are you right now?

497
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,520
Right in front of Senpai.

498
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,580
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

499
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,590
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

500
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,220
Yes.

501
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:04,970
Hey! Hello?

502
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:05,640
Hey! Hello?

503
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,560
Hello?!

504
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,410
I forgot he could negate our powers!

505
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:37,940
Do I look like a normal person to you?

506
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,900
Kill him.

507
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,280
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

508
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,740
Live on!

509
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,940
Kuriyama-san...

510
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,110
Senpai?

511
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,780
You're awake?

512
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,250
Oh, so that's what happened.

513
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,460
Yes.

514
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,370
You gave us some trouble
after turning into a shade,

515
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,660
but thankfully nobody got hurt.

516
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,060
Oh, I see.

517
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:50,190
It's probably because of the lull

518
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,430
that your wounds aren't healing at all.

519
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:58,090
They told me you might die
if I attacked you during it, you know?

520
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,450
I was worried about that the whole time.

521
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,660
Keep your hands off the wounds!

522
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,240
They'll heal once the lull passes.

523
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:13,130
Don't they say there's no such thing
as good fusion cuisine?

524
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,710
It's omelette rice!

525
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,940
Omelette rice?

526
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,500
Yes.

527
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,130
Where's the egg?

528
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,750
Here.

529
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,500
Boiled?!

530
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,620
They've been wiped out!

531
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,760
Wh-What the heck is that?!

532
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,720
Sakura got it to celebrate your recovery—

533
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,200
Nobody does that!

534
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,840
First of all, just because I was unconscious doesn't mean you could go raid my fridge

535
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,340
or put a pig head inside!

536
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,930
Don't worry about all that. Just go lie down.

537
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,360
I'll go shopping and make you a proper one this time.

538
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,000
Why?

539
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,250
"Why"?

540
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,600
Well...

541
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
What's wrong?

542
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,700
Nothing, it's just—

543
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,410
You can't even tell?

544
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,760
Sakura!

545
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,370
When did you get here?

546
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,210
She's been taking care of you.

547
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,090
Mirai hasn't left your side
even once since you collapsed.

548
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,200
You still don't get it?

549
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,710
Get what?

550
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,280
Mirai, I think this guy's a lost cause.

551
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,790
What are you saying?

552
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,880
What are you saying?!

553
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,770
You should just tell him.

554
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,610
Tell him what?

555
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,960
Tell him what?!

556
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,680
What are you two—

557
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,870
Whoa, it's hot!

558
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,230
It's summer, after all.

559
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,940
Summer, huh?

560
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,500
What? You were here all along—

561
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,460
Whoa, glasses!

562
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,740
How strange. Why am I hearing Akihito's voice?

563
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,160
Am I hallucinating?

564
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,440
Way to go!

565
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,830
Even though sunglasses don't have as much—

566
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,210
Looks like you're the real deal after all.

567
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,450
You'd better leave at once, then.

568
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:55,970
Letting you ogle my swimsuit-clad body for free is humiliating, to say the least.

569
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:58,250
Well, I didn't ask you to put it on!

570
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,210
Jeez.

571
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,360
Akihito.

572
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:00,890
What?

573
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:05,150
Learn from this and take a long, hard look at yourself.

574
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,770
I never want to go through anything like this again.

575
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,400
Okay.

576
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,200
Also, drag that pervert over there back to the clubroom with you.

577
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,410
Hey, pervert.

578
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,870
What, pervert?

579
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,410
The days are getting shorter and shorter, aren't they?

580
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,880
Well, the summer solstice was back in June.

581
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,370
Want to read some more before we go?

582
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,460
No.

583
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,610
Hiro'omi and Mitsuki sure are taking their time.

584
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,880
They've already left.

585
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,910
What?!

586
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:42,100
Is that any way to treat someone who
just came back from the brink of death?

587
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,390
Isn't that exactly why?

588
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,470
I'm sure they just don't know how to face you.

589
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,650
What's wrong?

590
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,540
N-Nothing.

591
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,490
Are you free after this, Kuriyama-san?

592
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,830
I thought maybe we could get some dinner on the way back.

593
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,040
Oh, if you're broke, I'll pay.

594
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,410
R-Right...

595
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:10,250
I mean, I don't remember what happened,
but I'm sure I caused you no end of trouble.

596
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,140
I wish you'd brought it up a little earlier.

597
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,890
Today's no good?

598
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,980
No.

599
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,600
This will probably end once the sun goes down.

600
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,390
What do you mean?

601
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,860
Why...

602
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,860
Why are you so nice to me?

603
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,530
Because we're kinda similar.

604
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,000
If I said that, would you get ma—

605
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,230
Is it that insulting?!

606
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,390
I-It's not like that!

607
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,100
You look like you can't stand
the very thought of it!

608
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,670
D-Does that make you happy?

609
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,800
Why would it?

610
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:03,200
Well, Mitsuki-senpai told me that you
take extreme pleasure in being bullied,

611
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,220
but I guess it's not that simple.

612
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,100
I'm glad it isn't!

613
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,020
Forget everything Mitsuki told you.

614
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,440
I don't want to!

615
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,350
I won't forget.

616
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,700
I won't ever forget.

617
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,320
What is this?

618
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,800
It's you.

619
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,330
The shade beyond the horizon—

620
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:32,710
a coalescence of human malice that
\hthey say could lead the world to ruin—

621
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:37,220
was the dreamshade within you.

622
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,090
That's me?

623
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,720
The whole reason I came to this town was to kill it.

624
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,560
But that didn't go too well.

625
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,640
I simply couldn't bring myself to kill you.

626
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,230
I didn't want to kill you.

627
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:55,570
So I...

628
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,300
When I heard that I could use my blood

629
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,420
to drive the shade from beyond the horizon
out of you during the lull,

630
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,500
I decided I had to do it at any cost.

631
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,440
What happened to you?

632
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,140
I disappeared.

633
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:33,690
Then...

634
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,300
Then who is this sitting in front of me?

635
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,190
You haven't regained consciousness yet.

636
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,380
This is all a dream.

637
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:50,950
The little bit of my blood that's still within you
is what's showing you this dream.

638
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,170
But it's all over now.

639
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:00,220
You'll wake up soon.

640
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:00,960
Kuriyama-san...

641
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:20,500
I thought it'd be easier in a dream,

642
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,650
but it's harder than I expected.

643
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,450
Goodbye.

644
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,620
A dream?

645
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,130
Shindou Photo Studio

646
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,770
Nagatsuki Public High School

647
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,020
Literature Club

648
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,120
Good morning, Senpai.

649
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,110
Quite cold today, isn't it?

650
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,050
Senpai?

651
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:31,580
Senpai!

652
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,020
Wait.

653
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,310
Please wait, Senpai!

654
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,650
Please... wait...

655
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,050
Kuriyama-san...

656
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:02,060
If dreamshades are formed from human malice,

657
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,320
that makes this a mass of human hatred.

658
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,070
It's quite fitting...

659
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,200
for me.

660
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,450
Three months?

661
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:15,830
Yeah. You were in a coma the entire time.

662
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,490
That long?

663
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,060
Of course.

664
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,100
You're no longer immortal.

665
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,560
You were robbed of the shade beyond the horizon
that was dwelling within you all this time.

666
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,250
It's a miracle you're alive.

667
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,190
What the hell?

668
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:32,260
So my immortality didn't
come from being a half-shade?

669
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:33,830
Probably not,

670
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,720
Though I'm not sure.

671
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,740
You should talk to your mother about it.

672
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,770
So where's Kuriyama-san?

673
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,610
Kuriyama Mirai's gone.

674
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,220
She used up all of her blood in a bid to save you

675
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,130
and took the shade beyond the horizon with her
when she vanished from this world.

676
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,090
Are you saying she's dead?

677
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:14,810
He hasn't eaten anything for
three whole months, after all.

678
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:17,000
Anyway, what do you make of this as a dreamshade?

679
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,720
Akkey says he hears noises coming from the sky.

680
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,180
The shade inside Kanbara-kun was
the one from beyond the horizon.

681
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:29,430
Considerin' how powerful
the shade released from him was,

682
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,320
ain't it strange he's the only one
who can hear it at all?

683
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,200
The only plausible explanation is that the shade itself is causing this.

684
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,370
Hiro'omi.

685
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,240
Where can I find Izumi-san?

686
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:48,270
Only someone from the cursed bloodline could've brought down the shade from beyond the horizon.

687
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,810
That's all.

688
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,010
But then we ran into a problem.

689
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,630
Kuriyama Mirai said that she didn't want to kill you.

690
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:00,260
So I reluctantly told her of
\ha way to save you instead—

691
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,020
one that would only be effective during the lull.

692
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,420
Did you really think that explanation would satisfy me?

693
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,650
Surely you knew she'd pick that option!

694
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,070
That's right.

695
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:14,930
Resent me if you must.

696
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:18,660
But as a member of the Nase family,
I was duty-bound to keep everyone safe.

697
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,410
To keep this world safe.

698
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,730
Likewise, Kuriyama Mirai also had something she wanted to protect.

699
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,960
Something she valued more than her own life.

700
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,470
Something she was willing to die to protect.

701
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,470
And she did so of her own free will.

702
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:38,660
I am indebted to her.

703
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,600
If she hadn't made the choice she did,

704
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,970
we wouldn't be here right now.

705
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:49,480
In fact, neither would the rest of the world.

706
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:54,480
Toward the end, she said you'd probably be
upset with her when you woke up.

707
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:57,510
"Serves him right," she said.

708
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:10,370
The days are getting shorter and shorter, aren't they?

709
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,000
I thought it'd be easier in a dream,

710
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,130
but it's harder than I expected.

711
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,880
Goodbye.

712
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:24,890
What the hell?

713
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,230
If it's Mirai you want, she never came home.

714
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,730
Inami-san...

715
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:37,240
Where is she?

716
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,160
Tell me! Where is she?!

717
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,550
I don't want to see...

718
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,060
I don't want to see that pathetic back of yours.

Right now, I don't even know if you'll ever get the chance to read this.

841
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,850
Senpai, Kuriyama Mirai here.

842
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:52,240
I'm on my way to see you.

843
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,540
And then, I'll defeat the
shade from beyond the horizon.

844
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,110
I'm feeling a little strange right now.

845
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,290
I actually feel kind of happy.

846
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,840
Born to a clan with a cursed bloodline,
my life up until now has been anything but nice.

847
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:22,220
I always wondered why I was born,

848
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:25,460
and some part of me always felt
I was better off dead.

849
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,120
But I was sorely mistaken.

850
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:33,100
Now I'm glad I came into this world.

851
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:38,020
My powers were said to be cursed.

852
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,500
They were despised and scorned.

853
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:46,540
However, I now know they were meant not to hurt people, but to save them.

854
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:51,200
So I'm really glad I held on
long enough to see this day.

855
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:57,440
I'm really glad I came to this town and met you.

856
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:03,480
As it turns out, I've been blessed all my life.

857
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,760
I wasn't cursed at all.

858
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,110
Senpai,

859
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:14,470
now you too can die a normal death one day.

860
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,520
So...

861
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,270
So, from now on,

862
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,890
please live a normal life.

863
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,590
Just like you told me back then.

864
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:29,490
Senpai, I...

865
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,240
don't feel unpleasant at all.

866
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,310
Senpai, you should be hiding!

867
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,700
Senpai,

868
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,340
I'll...

869
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,600
I'll protect you.

870
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:56,160
What's that thing in the sky?!

871
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:01,870
A dreamshade!

872
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,300
Nino-san?

873
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,960
Looks like we've got another carnival on our hands.

874
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,560
What on earth is this all about?!

875
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:15,140
Inami-san.

876
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:16,800
Look.

877
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,820
Akkey!

878
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,070
Hiro'omi?

879
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:21,980
What are you guys doing here?

880
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,230
Come to the
Literature Club
clubroom.

881
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,100
Come to the
Literature Club
clubroom.

882
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,230
P.S. Kuriyama
Mirai's alive.

883
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,100
P.S. Kuriyama
Mirai's alive.

884
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:22,230
P.S. Kuriyama
Mirai's alive.

885
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:22,230
Come to the
Literature Club
clubroom.

886
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,350
P.S. Kuriyama
Mirai's alive.

887
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,350
Come to the
Literature Club
clubroom.

888
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,230
P.S. Kuriyama
Mirai's alive.

889
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,230
Come to the
Literature Club
clubroom.

890
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,920
We found these.

891
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,290
The dreamshade!

892
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:30,180
It's being sucked in.

893
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:34,370
Let's hurry.

894
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,570
Wait! Hold on a sec!

895
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,740
What?

896
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,270
No, get back!

897
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,750
Is it a trap?

898
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,500
Oh no!

899
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,780
Just get back!

900
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:51,880
Wh-What is...

901
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,010
Stay away! This thing's dangerous!

902
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,270
Wh-Whoops!

903
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:01,970
What the hell are you doing?!

904
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,480
This is no time to be messing around!

905
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,850
What was that for?

906
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:06,440
Here I'd made an amazing entrance—

907
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,530
This is what you do after showing up
for the first time in forever?!

908
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,010
Were you behind those letters as well?

909
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,740
What were you being so roundabout for?

910
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,340
You idiot!

911
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:17,240
Hey, it takes one to know one, you know.

912
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,380
Who's that?

913
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,280
Akkey's mother.

914
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:18,490
Really?

915
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,000
Is Kuriyama-san really alive?

916
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,190
Yes, she's alive.

917
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,850
Mirai-chan is fighting all by herself right now.

918
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:28,810
I'm not supposed to be helping you out,

919
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:32,370
but the world will end if the
shade beyond the horizon wins this battle.

920
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:36,260
So I decided to consider this an emergency and act accordingly.

921
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:39,220
Anyway, how can we save Kuriyama-san?

922
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:42,270
Before we get to that, let me ask you something.

923
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,520
Guys, do you wanna go to
\hwhere Kuriyama Mirai is—

924
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,730
Lay off the nonsense and just tell us already!

925
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:51,570
Okay, okay.

926
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,440
Down there.

927
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,820
A shadestone?

928
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,120
What is this?

929
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,080
Don't tell me...

930
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,810
Right.

931
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,330
This stone is a part of Akkun.

932
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,550
In other words, it's also a part of
the shade from beyond the horizon.

933
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,490
Inside that shade is something Kuriyama Mirai created:

934
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:41,410
a puppet of Akihito formed by her intense emotions.

935
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:44,410
Grab hold of it with everything you've got.

936
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,920
That shadestone will do the rest.

937
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,920
How do you know all this?

938
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,280
Who do you think I am?

939
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,430
I'm your mother—the Kanbara Yayoi.

940
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,500
Someday you'll have to tell me all about myself. Got that?

941
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,080
Jeez, that made me jump!

942
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,200
Kanbara Yayoi!

943
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,050
Don't scare me like that, Izumin!

944
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,320
Now, hurry up and go!

945
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,650
Wait.

946
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:21,060
What do you plan to do
once you get there?

947
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,070
You're no longer...

948
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,580
...immortal.

949
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:26,620
I know.

950
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:32,840
But I'm still a pervert who's willing to do anything for the sake of glasses and bespectacled beauties!

951
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,300
Kodoku na hoho wo nurasu

952
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,300
My cheeks are stained with tears

953
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,660
Tears of solitude

954
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,660
Nurasu kedo

955
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,340
Sorry to say this, but it's our turn now.

956
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:43,700
But I can sense the coming of dawn

957
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:43,700
Yoake no kehai ga shizuka ni michite

958
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:46,100
How unusual for you to cave.

959
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:49,060
Watashi wo sora e maneku yo

960
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:49,060
It beckons me to the skies

961
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:47,640
Kanbara-senpai!

962
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:50,130
Keep your dropkick ready and waiting!

963
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,180
Kibou ga kanata de matteru

964
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,180
Hope's waiting for me on the other side

965
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:52,210
I'll bring her back for sure!

966
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:57,450
That is why I'll fly

967
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:57,450
Sou da yo iku yo

968
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:53,940
Okay!

969
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,060
Mayoi nagara mo

970
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,060
Despite losing my way

971
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:04,560
Kimi wo sagasu tabi

972
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:04,560
I continue to look for you

973
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:09,900
My hands sense the thoughts you left behind

974
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:09,900
Surechigau ishiki te ga fureta yo ne

975
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,160
I'll grab hold of you and never let go

976
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,160
Tsukamaeru yo shikkari

977
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,260
Two hearts seeking each other

978
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,260
Motome au kokoro

979
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:25,140
Sore wa yume no akashi

980
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:25,140
That's what dreams are made of

981
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:30,770
Tagai wo uketomeru tabi ni hikareteku

982
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:30,770
Supporting one another draws us closer every time

983
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:35,530
We don't need to live lives of sorrow anymore

984
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:35,530
Kanashii hibi wa mou iranai

985
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:40,860
Tagai wo uketomete ikiru yorokobi ni

986
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:40,860
There's joy in supporting one another as you live

987
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:45,410
Kitto kitto futari

988
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:45,410
I'm sure the two of us

989
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:43,780
Kuriyama-san!

990
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:50,670
Mezameru yo

991
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:50,670
Will come to realize that

992
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,260
Mayoi nagara mo

993
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,260
Despite losing my way

994
01:00:53,260 --> 01:01:00,280
Kimi wo mitsuketa yo

995
01:00:53,260 --> 01:01:00,280
I found you

996
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:17,310
Senpai?

997
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:22,820
Kuriyama-san...

998
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,570
Serves you right!

999
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:31,130
Senpai?

1000
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:32,140
Why?

1001
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,250
Why did you come here?

1002
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:37,090
Now everything I did was in vain!

1003
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:38,210
Why do you think I—

1004
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:39,710
Shut up!

1005
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,390
"Live on"?

1006
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,970
"Become a normal person"?

1007
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,680
Who the hell wished for that?

1008
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,130
Who the hell asked for that crap?!

1009
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,400
How unpleasant!

1010
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,520
How utterly unpleasant!

1011
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,680
I'm the one who should be feeling unpleasant!

1012
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,190
Anyway, I refuse to stand for this!

1013
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:01,730
I don't want a life that was
built on your sacrifice.

1014
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:03,620
A future like that...

1015
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,820
holds no meaning at all!

1016
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,660
Why don't you understand that?!

1017
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:12,330
Why was that so difficult for you to understand?

1018
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:23,950
Jeez!

1019
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:26,260
How can anyone call that
absurd thing a dreamshade?

1020
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,240
Don't ask me!

1021
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,850
You were the one who was harboring it to begin with!

1022
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,400
That's just the core.

1023
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,750
In truth, everything around us was inside you.

1024
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:42,880
Senpai,

1025
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,900
have you come up with anything yet?

1026
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:45,760
What do you mean?

1027
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,200
Like a weakness or something!

1028
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,910
You know, maybe it has
sensitive armpits like you.

1029
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:52,990
Armpits?

1030
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:54,120
Where exactly?!

1031
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,820
Then... do you have something you hate?

1032
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:59,000
Anything will do.

1033
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,980
Something I hate, huh?

1034
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:04,090
Capelin with roe?

1035
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:09,050
Capelin with roe!

1036
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:10,800
Think it's mad now?

1037
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,930
Don't ask me!

1038
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,940
Kuriyama-san!

1039
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,850
Did you just do that?

1040
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,040
I think so.

1041
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:46,510
Wait, you have a shade hand now?

1042
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:55,360
That shadestone was a part of the
shade beyond the horizon—a part of you?

1043
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:00,810
Senpai, you hold a part of its powers in your hand right now!

1044
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,230
I'm not sure how we'll manage,

1045
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:07,070
but if you can stand up to it...

1046
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:10,550
...then it might be worth getting closer.

1047
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,330
On the handlebar?!

1048
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:19,620
There are dreamshades up ahead.

1049
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,160
From below, too!

1050
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,060
Way to go, Kuriyama-san!

1051
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,610
So do I just keep going straight?

1052
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:34,330
I don't know.

1053
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:36,220
But you better go as fast as you can!

1054
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:38,140
After all,

1055
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,440
it's too late to hit the brakes!

1056
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:44,690
Senpai!

1057
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:04,280
No way!

1058
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,600
Senpai!

1059
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:24,390
That was absurd.

1060
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:26,940
This whole place is absurd.

1061
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,050
In other words,

1062
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,600
you're absurd.

1063
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,190
Me?!

1064
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,280
Somehow we made it, though.

1065
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:38,380
Where are we?

1066
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:40,400
Huh?

1067
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,040
Our opponent's in a panic too.

1068
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:45,920
You can tell?

1069
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,510
I can't.

1070
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:50,440
But that's how I feel.

1071
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:52,920
I'm sure things will work out!

1072
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,430
That's kind of unlike you.

1073
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,330
I don't know what you're talking about.

1074
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,110
That said,

1075
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,770
I, Kuriyama Mirai,

1076
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:07,190
am feeling optimistic to an unpleasant degree!

1077
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,800
Go for it, Kuriyama-san!

1078
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:07,410
Kuriyama-san...

1079
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:08,790
Akkey...

1080
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,180
Kuriyama-san?

1081
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:17,970
Kuriyama-san.

1082
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,260
Kuriyama-san!

1083
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:25,270
Don't kill us.

1084
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:26,520
Disgusting.

1085
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,520
I'm so scared.

1086
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,680
You monster.

1087
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,520
Don't kill us.

1088
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:30,770
Are these my memories?

1089
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,230
Senpai?

1090
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,670
Wh-What's going on?

1091
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:43,490
It's probably something similar to what showed up back in the Hollow Shadow.

1092
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:45,760
Close your eyes, Kuriyama-san.

1093
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:47,620
Just do it.

1094
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:49,000
Okay!

1095
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,570
Don't be swayed.

1096
01:07:54,490 --> 01:08:00,530
They say that dreamshades are formed from the twisted human heart and the hatred within, right?

1097
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:04,620
Well, this is a manifestation of the weakness in our hearts.

1098
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:07,850
Didn't I tell you back when we first met?

1099
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,550
I told you that the same goes for me.

1100
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,020
I'm here by your side.

1101
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,020
We met each other.

1102
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:19,490
You're not alone anymore.

1103
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,490
Senpai!

1104
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:24,990
Open your eyes.

1105
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,620
W-What...

1106
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:34,920
The hell?

1107
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:39,330
Let's take them out.

1108
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,800
All of them?

1109
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,460
Do you have a better idea?

1110
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,920
How unpleasant.

1111
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:58,040
Did we get them all?

1112
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,210
Who knows?

1113
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,550
Pretty, isn't it?

1114
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,120
Y-Yeah.

1115
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,910
What are you so terrified of?

1116
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:22,180
It's okay.

1117
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,360
Every last bit of you is me.

1118
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:28,490
All of it used to be inside me.

1119
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:31,800
Including that sickening envy,

1120
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:36,920
the despair over the fact that I'll never be human,

1121
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,290
the sorrow of being abandoned,

1122
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:40,880
and the regret over hurting someone!

1123
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:43,050
Senpai...

1124
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:48,220
And the selfishness, doubt, hatred, resignation, pettiness, and self-preserving attitude!

1125
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,700
I won't let any of it outside!

1126
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,100
It all belongs to me!

1127
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,600
I'll be the one to carry it all!

1128
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:04,400
I'm the immortal half-shade, you know?

1129
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,840
Senpai...

1130
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:29,050
Senpai,

1131
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,580
could you come over here?

1132
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,310
I'm sorry.

1133
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:41,310
Er, um, uh...

1134
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:42,440
I have...

1135
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,440
a request...

1136
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:47,720
A request?

1137
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:49,990
Um...

1138
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,840
Please hold out your hand.

1139
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,700
My hand?

1140
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,470
Yes.

1141
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,590
Please pat my head.

1142
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:09,880
I want you to pat my head.

1143
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:22,440
Kuriyama-san...

1144
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,690
Say "thank you."

1145
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:30,040
Thank you.

1146
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,500
Say it like you mean it.

1147
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,830
Thank you.

1148
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:43,250
So happy...

1149
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,420
I'm so happy!

1150
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,380
Kuriyama-san!

1151
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:49,760
I'm so happy!

1152
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,970
I'm so happy!

1153
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,450
Kuriyama-san, your legs...

1154
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:59,310
The shade beyond the horizon
has gone back to you,

1155
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,880
So this place will crumble away soon,

1156
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,690
and I'll probably disappear along with it.

1157
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,550
Now that it's gone back to you,

1158
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,300
I won't be able to exist.

1159
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,120
The real me is long gone, after all.

1160
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,490
I'm truly glad to have met you!

1161
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:20,040
Stop it!

1162
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:24,040
I'm truly glad to have fallen in love with you—

1163
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,460
Stop! Don't say it!

1164
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:30,960
Thank you so very much!

1165
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:34,130
Kuriyama-san!

1166
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:36,510
Hang on! This can't be happening!

1167
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:38,930
Kuriyama-san!

1168
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,020
Kuriyama-san!

1169
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:01,000
Nobody knows if this was all predestined from the start,

1170
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,580
or if it only happened thanks to Kuriyama-san's efforts.

1171
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,920
But I definitely want to believe it was the latter.

1172
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,380
Anyway, the shade from beyond the horizon came back to me,

1173
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:15,470
and peace was restored to the world.

1174
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:18,570
100 yen? Are you for real?!

1175
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:20,160
I'm off!

1176
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,060
Oh, morning!

1177
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:24,220
Good morning.

1178
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:25,390
Be careful out there.

1179
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:27,350
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1180
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:28,350
She dozed off!

1181
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:31,520
Come on, Sakura-chan! Wake up!

1182
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:32,710
Dreamshades exist as they always have,

1183
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:37,030
and spirit hunters make a living off them as they always have.

1184
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:40,580
Ayaka-san and Ai-chan went back to their place, too.

1185
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:49,960
Banana
Au Lait

1186
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:49,960
80% Milk

1187
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:44,370
Fujima Miroku went missing.

1188
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:51,130
One thing did change: Hiro'omi replaced Izumi-san as the head of the Nase family.

1189
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:53,900
But that didn't affect our lives much.

1190
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:54,880
Nee-san...

1191
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,410
One day, you will also come to understand.

1192
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:01,270
Forgive me.

1193
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:05,680
As usual, Mitsuki remains cooped up in the clubroom and showers me with verbal abuse.

1194
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,680
Literature Club

1195
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:11,940
If you know that good will prevail over evil in the end,
isn't it a waste of time to continue reading?

1196
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:15,040
That's what entertainment's all about, don't you think?

1197
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,440
Cut it out!

1198
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:19,280
Hey, it's only natural to keep one's hands warm in winter.

1199
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,080
There's nothing strange about what I'm doing.

1200
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,370
It's totally creepy-crawly!

1201
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:23,420
Three out of ten.

1202
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,870
However, Kuriyama Mirai's no longer here.

1203
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:34,310
In the end, I lost.

1204
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,510
TARGET: 50,000 YEN

1205
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:38,510
A future built on Kuriyama Mirai's sacrifice holds no meaning at all.

1206
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:45,000
That's what I yelled out back then, but here I am, having accepted—and living in—that very future.

1207
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,190
I'm sure this is what Kuriyama-san's saying right about now:

1208
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:50,280
"Serves you right."

1209
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,730
How unpleasant.

1210
01:15:57,940 --> 01:15:59,570
I...

1211
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:01,400
still have you.

1212
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,080
Just as there is light even at night,

1213
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:13,170
just as there are shadows during the day,

1214
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:16,420
the world will never be free of darkness.

1215
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:20,170
At the same time, it will also never be overcome by it.

1216
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:26,780
Dyed in that half-baked hue, the universe will continue to move on and set events in motion.

1217
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,520
And in the midst of all that, I...

1218
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,190
Seijaku wo kirisaku you

1219
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,190
Tearing the silence to shreds

1220
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:52,250
Otozureta no wa

1221
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:52,250
The time has come

1222
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:52,790
U-Um...

1223
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,790
Hitsuzen to shite no kaikou

1224
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,790
For us to cross paths

1225
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:57,970
It's a meeting we were fated to have

1226
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:57,970
Bokura no tame ni

1227
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:56,840
Bespectacled...

1228
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:02,870
My eyes filled with regret, I see you

1229
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:02,870
Koukai wo nageku me ni utsuru kimi wa sou

1230
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:03,590
Basically, I love the bespectacled Kuriyama-san!

1231
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:05,610
Urei wo matotte

1232
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:05,610
Clad in anguish

1233
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:09,190
Utsukushiku saita

1234
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:09,190
Blossoming beautifully

1235
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:13,810
Dareka no seimei ni tokeru hana

1236
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:13,810
I can see the flower bringing joy to people's lives

1237
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:19,750
Nee kimi ni mo mieru darou

1238
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:19,750
Can you see it too?

1239
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:18,150
How unpleasant.

1240
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:21,000
Nobody knows if this was all predestined from the start,

1241
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,570
Kitto

1242
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,570
I'm sure you can

1243
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,740
or if it only happened thanks to Kuriyama-san's efforts.

1244
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:29,030
Let's paint over all the mistakes we've made

1245
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:29,030
Kasaneta ayamachi nurikaeyou

1246
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:29,240
Maybe my feelings for Kuriyama-san reached her.

1247
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:34,590
Nando demo ii sa kurikaeshiteku Start Line

1248
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:34,590
We'll start over and over again until we succeed

1249
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:32,920
And that's how I reunited with Kuriyama Mirai.

1250
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,190
If our story had ended after a reunion like that,

1251
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:40,270
Kako to wa chigau asu wo

1252
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:40,270
For the sake of a fresh future

1253
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:41,130
I don't think any story in this world would be worth telling.

1254
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:46,190
Futari dake no kibou egaku Start Line

1255
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:46,190
We'll start realizing our very own hopes and dreams

1256
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,140
Oh right, Kuriyama-san.

1257
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,750
You forgot something.

1258
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:49,720
I never say goodbye

1259
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:49,720
I have never said goodbye

1260
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,810
Itsudatte sou sa

1261
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,810
And I never will

1262
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:55,140
Could you do me a favor and put these glasses on?

1263
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:06,160
Continuing crystallization of proof

1264
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:06,160
Keizoku shite iku shoumei to shite no kesshou

1265
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:08,010
Beyond the Boundary

1266
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,820
Honoka ni yureru hi wo yadoshite

1267
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,820
Sheltering a faintly flickering flame

1268
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:14,060
Past Volume

1269
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:10,960
Kousai wo hanatsu mirai

1270
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:10,960
Emblazoned with a future radiating brilliance

1271
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,470
Yakitsuketa kimi no me wa sukoshi kanashisou de

1272
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,470
Your eyes seem to hold a little bit of sadness

1273
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:17,230
Take a look into my eyes

1274
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:20,160
Wipe away that final tear

1275
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:20,160
Saigo no hitoshizuku wo nugutte

1276
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,880
Every time you wanna see call me

1277
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,880
Every time you wanna see me, call me

1278
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,770
Saisho ni deatta ano basho de sa

1279
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,770
I’ll be at the place where we first met

1280
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:30,000
Chiriyuku unmei ni aragatte

1281
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:30,000
Fight against the fate that befalls you

1282
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,950
Sou azayaka ni sakihokore

1283
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,950
Yeah, bloom vibrantly, with glory

1284
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:38,590
Always

1285
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:45,200
Connected to your singing voice

1286
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:45,200
Kimi no utau koe to tsunagaru you

1287
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:50,860
Kokoro no oku narihibiita boku no ne

1288
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:50,860
My sound rings out and echoes deep within my heart

1289
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:56,560
Inori ni ukabu asu wa

1290
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:56,560
The tomorrow that surfaces in my prayer

1291
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:01,920
Ikiru imi wo kibou ni kaeru kara

1292
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:01,920
Transforms a reason to live into hope

1293
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:06,550
I wanna be with you

1294
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,800
Nido to wa nai ima no genjitsu wo

1295
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,800
To make a sacrifice to gain possession of

1296
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,410
This present reality, impossible to repeat

1297
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,410
Te ni ireru tame no gisei nante

1298
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:15,200
Kesshite kodoku to ketsubetsu shikirenai

1299
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:15,200
The act is unbreakably bound to loneliness

1300
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,280
Ima no boku ni hakarenai

1301
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,280
I can’t measure that weight as I am now

1302
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,040
Sore demo ii nda

1303
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,040
But even so, that’s fine

1304
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,850
Hibikiwatare inori yo

1305
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,850
Echo far and wide, my prayer

1306
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:25,310
Our reverberating singing voices

1307
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:25,310
Kodama suru bokura no utagoe

1308
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:27,910
Issun no hikari wo egaita

1309
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:27,910
Painted a momentary light

1310
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:30,760
Terashidasu ichirin no hana yo

1311
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:30,760
Illuminating a single flower

1312
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:34,240
Kimi to futari te wo tsunaide

1313
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:34,240
I want to keep our hands connected

1314
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,430
Zutto itai nda

1315
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,430
And always be with you

1316
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:38,390
I can't hear you...

1317
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:47,670
I can't hear you...

1318
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:08,710
Who...

1319
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,430
Kuriyama-san?

1320
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:22,440
Who...

1321
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,940
Am I?

1322
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:31,630
Kuriyama-

1323
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,400
Who...

1324
01:21:34,450 --> 01:21:35,910
Are you?

1325
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,670
Kuriyama-san...
