1
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:25,733


2
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,940
Yes, hello?

3
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,580
My name is Nase Izumi.

4
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,780
Nase? The Nase?

5
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,020
Yes.

6
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,110
I'm calling with some news for you.

7
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,480
Kuriyama Mirai-san?

8
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,260
Pleased to meet you.

9
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,600
I'm Nase Izumi.

10
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,480
This is Kuriyama Mirai.

11
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,730
A spirit hunter and legitimate successor of the cursed bloodline.

12
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,330
Do you mean the clan that is
shunned by most spirit hunters?

13
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,240
Yes.

14
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,030
Kuriyama-san.

15
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,230
She can use her own blood as a weapon.

16
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:16,350
Not only can it be hardened, it can also be used as a lethal poison that erodes bodily tissue.

17
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,770
Will that be enough?

18
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,600
It's hard to say.

19
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,850
But I believe she stands a very good chance.

20
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,510
Isn't the target said to be immortal?

21
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,980
Yes.

22
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,580
Immortal?

23
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,210
In truth, he's just terrifyingly quick to recover,

24
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,410
but he's known to the spirit hunters
around here as the "immortal half-shade."

25
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,290
The immortal half-shade?

26
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,910
Let me show you.

27
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,220
\hUnlike shadelings, he's half human and half shade—a preposterous and dangerous being.

28
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,010
My research showed me that his shade half resembles the shade beyond the horizon.

29
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,420
My younger brother attempted to kill this fellow
but had the tables turned on him.

30
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,630
He nearly died from his injuries.

31
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,100
You're the only one I can count on.

32
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,690
Please.

33
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,360
This is the shade from beyond the horizon?

34
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,560
Sorry for dragging you along to
that stifling meeting back there.

35
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,190
It may be because of this area's long history, but we have certain customs.

36
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,520
Bonsai?

37
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,660
Yes.

38
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,940
Um, that aside...

39
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,850
What?

40
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,790
Where's this shade from beyond the horizon?

41
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,240
Rest assured.

42
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,230
He's under constant supervision.

43
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,340
I'll have to kill him sooner or later, right?

44
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,020
Then I'd prefer it to be sooner.

45
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,550
Can you?

46
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,220
How should I know?!

47
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,520
You had no idea either—

48
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,520
That's not it.

49
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,800
I'm asking you if you're mentally prepared for this.

50
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,370
The half-shade's name is Kanbara Akihito.

51
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,300
Suicide.

52
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,900
Defined in the dictionary as "the act of taking one's own life,"

53
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,780
it's something I will probably never even think about doing.

54
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,730
Not because I think it's unethical,

55
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,280
but for a more fundamental reason.

56
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,940
However, let's save that for later.

57
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,200
Right now, she's about to die.

58
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,940
At least, it seemed like that to me.

59
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,240
At this point the story can proceed in one of two ways.

60
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,900
Either the protagonist plays an active role in the events that unfold,

61
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:01,840
or he takes a passive role as the story moves on without him.

62
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,390
By all accounts, I'd fall into the latter category,

63
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,680
but for some reason, I chose the former option at this time.

64
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,520
H-Hey!

65
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,280
I won't repeat everything I said, but...

66
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,870
"...at any rate, someone who looks as good in glasses as you

67
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,330
simply must not die!"

68
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,700
That was my heartfelt plea to her.

69
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,920
I finished by screaming out everything I felt at that moment.

70
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,210
"Basically, I love glasses!"

71
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,090
How unpleasant.

72
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,730
You—

73
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,850
You picked a fight with the wrong person.

74
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,420
Hey, uh...

75
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,450
Think you could at least do something about this sword?

76
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,410
Please?

77
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,320
And that's how I met Kuriyama Mirai.

78
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,570
If our story had ended after a meeting like that,

79
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,700
I don't think any story in this world would be worth telling.

80
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,060
Beyond the Boundary

81
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,740
Did she give up?

82
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,580
Where did you even come from?!

83
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,650
Take this!

84
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,160
Hey, we can't go around destroying buckets!

85
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,020
Jeez!

86
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,170
I think it's about time we put an end to this.

87
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,550
What is this, a horror movie?

88
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,660
E-Everything's dark!

89
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,640
What'd you do to me?!

90
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,840
It's just a bucket.

91
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,980
Are you hungry?

92
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,650
What's the big deal?

93
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,860
It's not like you lose anything!

94
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,220
Of course I do!

95
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,990
You keep chipping away at what's left of my heart!

96
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,390
I told you I still feel pain, didn't I?!

97
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,550
Do you have any idea how much it hurts?

98
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,820
Doing whatever you please to us immortals
is just discrimination!

99
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,170
People are going to hear you, you know.

100
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,660
It's fine.

101
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,340
I already made sure no one else was around.

102
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,380
Thanks for waiting.

103
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,220
Here are your extra burrito, mole poblano, and chili con carne combos.

104
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,680
Enjoy yourselves.

105
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,580
You ordered even more food?!

106
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,430
You're being unpleasant.

107
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,980
I'm the one who's finding this unpleasant!

108
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,660
Not only do you practice on me,

109
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,710
you even have the nerve to mooch off me for dinner!

110
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,080
Mooch?

111
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,860
I thought we had a deal.

112
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,860
I'd refrain from challenging you to any more fights tonight, and in exchange,

113
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,620
you'd treat me to dinner.

114
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,100
So that means you're going to attack me again tomorrow, I take it?

115
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,810
Why wouldn't I?

116
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,300
Kuriyama-san!

117
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,450
Are you alright?

118
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,370
I'm fine.

119
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,460
Just a little anemic.

120
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,220
I was using my blood, after all.

121
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,640
Let's take this to Ayaka-san tomorrow.

122
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,140
I'll come pick you up in the morning.

123
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,910
You shouldn't get too close to me.

124
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,840
I've unleashed powers I normally keep in check.

125
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,610
Immortal or not, you don't want to touch my blood right now.

126
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,570
We still have to do something about that bleeding.

127
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,650
Give me your hand.

128
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,200
I'll do it myself.

129
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,620
Come on.

130
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,550
Kuriyama-san, you haven't joined a club yet, have you?

131
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,800
I don't have time for that.

132
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I can't interest you in the Literature Club?

133
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Why do you ask?

134
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,050
Because I'd love for a beauty with glasses to join.

135
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,560
How unpleasant.

136
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,410
Well, it's the club I'm in,

137
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,060
and we only have two real members right now.

138
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,520
Oh, and the other one's a spirit hunter too,

139
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,540
so I'm sure it'd work in your favor professionally as well.

140
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,010
I'll have to pass.

141
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,700
Huh? Why?

142
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,950
I don't want to associate with other people...

143
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,840
I guess his immortality really can't
be dealt with using normal methods.

144
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,460
Yes.

145
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,570
You should observe him for a while.

146
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,390
Attacking him haphazardly won't get you anywhere.

147
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:33,930
But...

148
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,510
In time, his shade half is sure to surface again,
as it did against Hiro'omi.

149
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,090
Use that opportunity.

150
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,310
Okay.

151
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,050
Also...

152
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,270
Let me offer you a warning.

153
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,380
You'd be better off keeping
your distance from Akihito-kun.

154
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,260
Oh, right.

155
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,110
Kuriyama-san.

156
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,120
Y-Yes?

157
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,050
Remember what we talked about yesterday? How about it?

158
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,000
I want to invite her to come visit the Literature Club. Is that okay?

159
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,290
She says she hasn't joined any clubs,

160
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,240
and there aren't many other spirit hunters at our school.

161
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,500
Besides, she only just got here—

162
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,630
I thought I refused already.

163
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,430
I'm scared.

164
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,070
I'm terrified of taking lives.

165
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,640
Then why don't you quit being a spirit hunter?

166
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,130
If I could...

167
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,560
If I could, I would've done so a long time ago!

168
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,260
I tried to quit!

169
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,770
I tried to quit being a spirit hunter,

170
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,900
quit killing dreamshades,

171
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,740
and live a normal life!

172
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,990
But this cursed blood flowing through my veins is anything but normal.

173
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
This power of mine...

174
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,120
The same goes for me.

175
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,050
Why would you say that?

176
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,020
Why...

177
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,810
You're an investigator from the Spirit Hunter Association's Observation Bureau?

178
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,870
That's right.

179
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,970
I'm Fujima Miroku. Nice to meet you, Nase Izumi-san.

180
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,070
So, what is your business here?

181
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,410
The Hollow Shadow.

182
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,700
Dreamshades this powerful don't show up too often,

183
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,700
so I'm here to observe it.

184
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,950
Dreams mark the way to the underworld.

185
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,710
And we call the darkness that lies within them "dreamshades," masses of human resentment

186
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,760
brought to life by the twisted human heart and all of its hatred, envy, and aggression.

187
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,070
Dreamshades will continue to exist as long as humans do.

188
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,970
So long as we can see them, we will continue to kill them.

189
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,440
Doesn't that make you feel like spirit hunting thrives on the misery of others?

190
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,480
I see you have some interesting views on the subject.

191
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,190
How so?

192
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:59,330
Having descended from a long line of spirit hunters
that have been fighting shades since antiquity,

193
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,540
I see shades the same way a farmer sees rice,

194
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,940
or a fisherman sees fish.

195
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,350
It doesn't matter what they are.

196
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,820
I see.

197
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,270
May I ask you something?

198
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,250
Go ahead.

199
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,750
What are dreamshades to you?

200
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,760
That goes without saying, doesn't it?

201
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,760
Monsters, nothing more.

202
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,760
Do I...

203
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,930
look like a normal person...

204
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,670
to you?

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,770
In my eyes,

206
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,280
you're nothing but a bespectacled beauty.

207
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,700
What... the...

208
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,130
The Hollow Shadow?

209
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,640
Kuriyama-san...

210
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,300
Hurry up...

211
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,520
And stab me!

212
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,400
It's in a weakened state right now, isn't it?

213
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,280
Chase it out of my body and you'll be able to finish it off!

214
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,730
But you'll...

215
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,830
I won't die.

216
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,320
I'm immortal, after all.

217
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,910
I won't last much longer.

218
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,250
Hurry up!

219
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,290
B-But...

220
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,670
Isn't this what you came here to do?

221
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,060
Didn't you come here telling yourself you had to do this?

222
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,170
Y-Yes, but...

223
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,470
Then don't falter now!

224
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,480
Killing it won't change anything.

225
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,920
Not the blood flowing through your veins, nor the position you find yourself in.

226
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,810
It won't change a single thing!

227
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,100
But you still came here!

228
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,190
So finish the job!

229
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,560
Don't give in to the Hollow Shadow!

230
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,610
Otherwise everything you've done
will have been in vain!

231
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,400
Stab me!

232
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,570
I'm immortal.

233
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,410
So...

234
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,020
So...

235
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,410
live on!

236
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,570
Senpai...

237
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,090
Unleash your blood.

238
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,420
Goodbye.

239
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,090
Senpai...

240
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,070
Hold it.

241
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,110
Stay back.

242
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,790
What's wrong with you?

243
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,670
You went up against the Hollow Shadow, you know?

244
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,730
Didn't you realize this was going to happen?

245
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,300
Forgive me.

246
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,950
I can't guarantee you'll survive this.

247
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,180
I know.

248
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,860
You know that Kanbara-kun's a half-shade, don't you?

249
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,830
When his body falls into a perilous state,

250
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,110
his shade half awakens.

251
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,490
Basically, this is big trouble.

252
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,360
Sen... pai...

253
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,830
The cage!

254
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,620
He can negate our spirit powers.

255
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,710
Ayaka-san!

256
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,410
I know.

257
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,760
Oh no!

258
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,400
No way.

259
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,860
Nino-san!

260
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,630
This'll only hold him for a little while.

261
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,650
Now's our chance!

262
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,060
This isn't working!

263
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,750
He's going to break out!

264
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,410
Do I...

265
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,370
look like a normal person...

266
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,620
to you?

267
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,460
The same goes for me.

268
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,580
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,940
I didn't understand a thing about you,

270
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,560
and yet I...

271
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
I have to stop you.

272
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,350
Kuriyama-san?

273
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,820
I did it again...

274
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,100
She's...

275
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,970
Senpai.

276
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,720
Sorry.

277
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,080
I'm so sorry!

278
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,030
King of Chinese

279
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,030
Thanks for the food!

280
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,840
Slow down and savor it.

281
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,290
I feel like I don't have nearly enough blood!

282
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,180
I need to replenish my iron.

283
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,660
Besides, I can't believe this isn't the Hollow Shadow,

284
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,940
Or that it's only worth 200 yen!

285
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,290
I don't think Ayaka-san would lie, though.

286
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,250
Then what's going on?

287
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,010
How would I know?

288
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,740
Aren't you going to eat?

289
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,850
Nah.

290
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,050
Where are you going?

291
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:55,990
The restroom.

292
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,910
Hey...

293
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,240
Yes?

294
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,490
Do I look like a normal person to you?

295
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,250
Let's see...

296
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,670
In my eyes, you're nothing but an
ill-mannered guy who's obsessed with glasses.

297
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,800
What the heck?

298
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,280
I've given it some thought since then.

299
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,200
I realized I shouldn't hesitate

300
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,210
\hand that I have to defeat Senpai—
the shade from beyond the horizon.

301
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
But I...

302
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:03,260
I don't want to kill Senpai.

303
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,720
I don't want to... kill him.

304
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:16,060
I heard that the lull doesn't
actually begin until midnight,

305
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,820
but for some reason, I sense tension in the air.

306
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,160
It's more stagnant than tense, if you ask me.

307
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,290
Lull, eh?

308
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,580
The name fits perfectly.

309
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:35,080
I should probably walk home
with my little sister right now.

310
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,790
She's long gone, though.

311
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,960
Why?!

312
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,790
Because she doesn't want to
walk home with you.

313
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,930
Why?!

314
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,170
Because she hates you.

315
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,240
Why?!

316
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,880
Because you keep acting like that all the time!

317
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:51,110
Senpai, I'd better hurry or I won't make it in time for the supermarket's packed meals sale!

318
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,970
Oh, okay.

319
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,720
Later!

320
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,320
Akkey.

321
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,420
Don't take this lightly.

322
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,560
I'm feeling strangely nervous.

323
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,030
Sounds like love.

324
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,790
Want a ride?

325
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,050
I'll give you one.

326
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,800
A lull, huh?

327
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,430
Why are you here?

328
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,560
I figured we could talk a bit while I drive.

329
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,310
Is that a dreamshade?

330
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,470
Yes.

331
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:52,820
Just like the Hollow Shadow, there are many powerful shades that lack a physical form.

332
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:59,700
They say this shade was born from all the resentment shown by humans over the years.

333
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,430
It is an entity formed from accumulated malice.

334
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:08,910
Apparently it'll lead the world to ruin
if left alone, or something.

335
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:16,350
This dreamshade, said to be the cause of disease, war, and natural disasters,

336
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,890
is also commonly referred to as "the one beyond the horizon."

337
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,110
Thankfully, only a fraction of it has shown up so far—

338
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,360
not enough to be harmful.

339
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,400
Why would you tell me this?

340
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,700
We believe you Nases have the information we need, but you aren't very willing to share.

341
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,420
So I thought I'd try to get it from you.

342
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,690
Looks like they haven't told you anything, though.

343
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,920
Yakiimo.

344
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,500
It's the truth!

345
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,930
So, what is being done about this shade from beyond the horizon?

346
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,350
Do you mean to tell me we Nases have been preparing in secret?

347
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,100
Do you want to know that badly?

348
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:09,320
Does Kuriyama-san have anything to do with
the shade from beyond the horizon?

349
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,860
Beats me.

350
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,450
But it would be amusing if it did,

351
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,160
don't you agree?

352
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,830
Bro!

353
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,670
Oh dear.

354
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,220
You tailed your little sister all the way here?

355
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,220
It's almost like you have a thing for her.

356
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,960
How you wound me.

357
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,740
The "almost like" part was unnecessary!

358
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,360
What are you after?

359
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,070
Ask your little sister.

360
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,370
Onii-chan!

361
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,960
That was a wonderful display of love for your brother.

362
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,970
Wh-What the heck?

363
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,940
Akihito-kun was run over...

364
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,270
...so why isn't he hurt?

365
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,370
Huh?

366
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,030
Oh, well...

367
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,230
Don't kill us!

368
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,520
Please, don't kill us!

369
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,460
Why would you say that?

370
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,130
Izumi-san?

371
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,300
You must be worn out.

372
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,850
Why are you here?

373
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,230
Get some more rest.

374
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,800
Thank you for riding with us today.

375
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
This is Hananodera Station.

376
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,200
Please make sure you have all your belongings.

377
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,210
The obvious conclusion is that the lull's taking its toll on him.

378
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:34,470
But I have a feeling that it severely weakened
not only his shade half, but also his human half.

379
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,260
Isn't there any way to make him better?

380
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,680
If he were human or shade,
there'd be several things we could do.

381
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,580
But Kanbara-kun's a half-shade.

382
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,810
Frankly speakin', he's such a rare creature that I have no idea how to treat him.

383
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,200
Senpai...

384
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:58,700
How long have Kanbara-senpai and Mirai known each other?

385
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,540
Well, I don't know all the details,

386
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,950
but they met around when
Mirai-chan came here, I think.

387
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,210
It's almost time.

388
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,300
Stay alert, Ai.

389
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,130
Okay.

390
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,130
Thank you.

391
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,400
I was lost in thought.

392
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,510
It's okay.

393
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,460
That aside, Kanbara-senpai...

394
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,970
I'm sure they'd let you stay by his side so long as you ask.

395
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,790
But it's not like I could do anything.

396
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,850
Even so, you want to stay with him.

397
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,800
W-Well...

398
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,250
How unpleasant.

399
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,530
You don't really mean it when you say "how unpleasant."

400
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,310
How unpleasant.

401
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,500
You meant it this time.

402
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,450
How can you tell?

403
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,170
Nobody can stop you from staying by Kanbara-senpai's side if you want to.

404
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:56,840
I-It's not about staying by his side.
Nothing like that.

405
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,610
I... just...

406
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,720
He loves glasses.

407
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,400
Like I said, it's not like that!

408
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,510
It's just...

409
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,640
I feel normal around him.

410
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,500
I'm part of a clan with a cursed bloodline.

411
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,400
I've got these abnormal powers.

412
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,600
But he makes me feel normal.

413
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,650
He always has, right from the day we met.

414
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,060
That's good to hear.

415
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,660
I'm glad you met him.

416
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,040
How unpleasant.

417
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,170
Now that one you didn't mean.

418
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,370
Izumi-san!

419
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,880
Senpai?

420
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
He's escaped.

421
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,930
I wonder how Akihito's shade half took over.

422
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:37,560
Ayaka-san told me while he was passed out that his human half had also grown extremely weak.

423
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,820
It must've become even weaker than his impaired shade half.

424
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,830
And as a result, his shade half
ended up taking over?

425
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,840
Yes.

426
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,710
That would explain why he wasn't as strong as usual back there.

427
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,710
So he escaped instead.

428
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,090
I'm sorry!

429
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,220
"No. 135"?

430
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:19,100
She clearly possesses that
special something unique
to all bespectacled
beauties, but her
expression's too
forced and unnatural.

431
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:19,100
Final Score: 83%

432
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,260
"Final Score: 83%."

433
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,580
"She clearly possesses that special something unique to bespectacled beauties,

434
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,820
but her expression's too forced and unnatural."

435
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,360
How unpleasant.

436
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,120
Did you see those boxes over there?

437
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,460
H-He's a pervert!

438
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,630
It's depressing to see one of the rare half-shades turn out to be like this.

439
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:35,410
I don't think someone who breaks into apartments should be passing judgment on others.

440
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,700
But this is too much!

441
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,090

Kuriyama-san's

468
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,270
Kuriyama-san's
Birthday

469
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,260
How unpleasant!

470
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,100
That text you sent me...

471
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,520
Is it true?

472
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,700
Yes.

473
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,980
The lull should impair all dreamshades, even the one from beyond the horizon.

474
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,360
If you use all of your blood and your entire body,

475
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:16,240
you'll be able to draw out Akihito-kun's
dominant shade half without killing him.

476
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,040
However, that means the shade beyond
the horizon will invade every last inch of you.

477
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,170
But that'll save Senpai, right?

478
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,920
You've already made your decision, haven't you?

479
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,090
I have.

480
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,260
This is where Akihito-kun is.

481
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,070
He'll wake up eventually.

482
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:40,010
If you truly wish to save him, go there as soon as you can.

483
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,280
Kuriyama-san.

484
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,030
Akihito-kun wants you to live on.

485
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,560
He wants you to kill him and live on.

486
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,890
I'm certain he feels that way.

487
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,530
I guess so.

488
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,910
You're still going to save him despite that?

489
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,540
Yes.

490
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,040
I'm sure he'll be upset with me.

491
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,100
If he finds out I did something like this,
he'll say that I don't understand anything.

492
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,740
Just like he did back then.

493
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,600
Serves him right!

494
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,030
Senpai!

495
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,320
Hello?

496
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,780
Where are you right now?

497
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,220
Right in front of Senpai.

498
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,280
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

499
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,290
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

500
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,920
Yes.

501
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:30,670
Hey! Hello?

502
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,340
Hey! Hello?

503
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,260
Hello?!

504
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,110
I forgot he could negate our powers!

505
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,640
Do I look like a normal person to you?

506
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,600
Kill him.

507
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,980
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

508
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,440
Live on!

509
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,640
Kuriyama-san...

510
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,810
Senpai?

511
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,480
You're awake?

512
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,950
Oh, so that's what happened.

513
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,160
Yes.

514
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,070
You gave us some trouble
after turning into a shade,

515
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,360
but thankfully nobody got hurt.

516
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,760
Oh, I see.

517
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,890
It's probably because of the lull

518
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,130
that your wounds aren't healing at all.

519
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,790
They told me you might die
if I attacked you during it, you know?

520
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,150
I was worried about that the whole time.

521
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,360
Keep your hands off the wounds!

522
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,940
They'll heal once the lull passes.

523
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,830
Don't they say there's no such thing
as good fusion cuisine?

524
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,410
It's omelette rice!

525
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,640
Omelette rice?

526
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,200
Yes.

527
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,830
Where's the egg?

528
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,450
Here.

529
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,200
Boiled?!

530
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,320
They've been wiped out!

531
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,460
Wh-What the heck is that?!

532
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,420
Sakura got it to celebrate your recovery—

533
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,900
Nobody does that!

534
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,540
First of all, just because I was unconscious doesn't mean you could go raid my fridge

535
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,040
or put a pig head inside!

536
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,630
Don't worry about all that. Just go lie down.

537
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,060
I'll go shopping and make you a proper one this time.

538
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,700
Why?

539
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,950
"Why"?

540
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,300
Well...

541
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,300
What's wrong?

542
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,400
Nothing, it's just—

543
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,110
You can't even tell?

544
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,460
Sakura!

545
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,070
When did you get here?

546
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,910
She's been taking care of you.

547
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,790
Mirai hasn't left your side
even once since you collapsed.

548
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,900
You still don't get it?

549
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,410
Get what?

550
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,980
Mirai, I think this guy's a lost cause.

551
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,490
What are you saying?

552
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,580
What are you saying?!

553
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,470
You should just tell him.

554
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,310
Tell him what?

555
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,660
Tell him what?!

556
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,380
What are you two—

557
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,570
Whoa, it's hot!

558
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,930
It's summer, after all.

559
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,640
Summer, huh?

560
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,200
What? You were here all along—

561
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,160
Whoa, glasses!

562
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:05,440
How strange. Why am I hearing Akihito's voice?

563
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,860
Am I hallucinating?

564
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,140
Way to go!

565
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,530
Even though sunglasses don't have as much—

566
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,910
Looks like you're the real deal after all.

567
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,150
You'd better leave at once, then.

568
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:21,670
Letting you ogle my swimsuit-clad body for free is humiliating, to say the least.

569
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,950
Well, I didn't ask you to put it on!

570
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,910
Jeez.

571
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,060
Akihito.

572
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,590
What?

573
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:30,850
Learn from this and take a long, hard look at yourself.

574
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:35,470
I never want to go through anything like this again.

575
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,100
Okay.

576
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,900
Also, drag that pervert over there back to the clubroom with you.

577
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,110
Hey, pervert.

578
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,570
What, pervert?

579
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,110
The days are getting shorter and shorter, aren't they?

580
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,580
Well, the summer solstice was back in June.

581
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,070
Want to read some more before we go?

582
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,160
No.

583
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,310
Hiro'omi and Mitsuki sure are taking their time.

584
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,580
They've already left.

585
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,610
What?!

586
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:07,800
Is that any way to treat someone who
just came back from the brink of death?

587
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,090
Isn't that exactly why?

588
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:13,170
I'm sure they just don't know how to face you.

589
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,350
What's wrong?

590
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,240
N-Nothing.

591
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,190
Are you free after this, Kuriyama-san?

592
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,530
I thought maybe we could get some dinner on the way back.

593
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,740
Oh, if you're broke, I'll pay.

594
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,110
R-Right...

595
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:35,950
I mean, I don't remember what happened,
but I'm sure I caused you no end of trouble.

596
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,840
I wish you'd brought it up a little earlier.

597
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,590
Today's no good?

598
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,680
No.

599
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,300
This will probably end once the sun goes down.

600
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,090
What do you mean?

601
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,560
Why...

602
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Why are you so nice to me?

603
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,230
Because we're kinda similar.

604
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,700
If I said that, would you get ma—

605
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,930
Is it that insulting?!

606
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,090
I-It's not like that!

607
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,800
You look like you can't stand
the very thought of it!

608
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,370
D-Does that make you happy?

609
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:21,500
Why would it?

610
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:28,900
Well, Mitsuki-senpai told me that you
take extreme pleasure in being bullied,

611
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,920
but I guess it's not that simple.

612
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,800
I'm glad it isn't!

613
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,720
Forget everything Mitsuki told you.

614
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,140
I don't want to!

615
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,050
I won't forget.

616
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,400
I won't ever forget.

617
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,020
What is this?

618
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,500
It's you.

619
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,030
The shade beyond the horizon—

620
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:58,410
a coalescence of human malice that
\hthey say could lead the world to ruin—

621
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,920
was the dreamshade within you.

622
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,790
That's me?

623
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:10,420
The whole reason I came to this town was to kill it.

624
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:14,260
But that didn't go too well.

625
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,340
I simply couldn't bring myself to kill you.

626
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,930
I didn't want to kill you.

627
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,270
So I...

628
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,000
When I heard that I could use my blood

629
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,120
to drive the shade from beyond the horizon
out of you during the lull,

630
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,200
I decided I had to do it at any cost.

631
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:57,140
What happened to you?

632
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:57,840
I disappeared.

633
00:44:58,970 --> 00:44:59,390
Then...

634
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,000
Then who is this sitting in front of me?

635
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,890
You haven't regained consciousness yet.

636
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:11,080
This is all a dream.

637
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,650
The little bit of my blood that's still within you
is what's showing you this dream.

638
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,870
But it's all over now.

639
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:25,920
You'll wake up soon.

640
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,660
Kuriyama-san...

641
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,200
I thought it'd be easier in a dream,

642
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,350
but it's harder than I expected.

643
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,150
Goodbye.

644
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,320
A dream?

645
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,830
Shindou Photo Studio

646
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,470
Nagatsuki Public High School

647
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:19,720
Literature Club

648
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,820
Good morning, Senpai.

649
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,810
Quite cold today, isn't it?

650
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:52,750
Senpai?

651
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,280
Senpai!

652
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:03,720
Wait.

653
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,010
Please wait, Senpai!

654
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,350
Please... wait...

655
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:30,750
Kuriyama-san...

656
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:27,760
If dreamshades are formed from human malice,

657
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,020
that makes this a mass of human hatred.

658
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,770
It's quite fitting...

659
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,900
for me.

660
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,150
Three months?

661
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,530
Yeah. You were in a coma the entire time.

662
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:43,190
That long?

663
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:44,760
Of course.

664
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,800
You're no longer immortal.

665
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,260
You were robbed of the shade beyond the horizon
that was dwelling within you all this time.

666
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,950
It's a miracle you're alive.

667
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,890
What the hell?

668
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,960
So my immortality didn't
come from being a half-shade?

669
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,530
Probably not,

670
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,420
Though I'm not sure.

671
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,440
You should talk to your mother about it.

672
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,470
So where's Kuriyama-san?

673
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,310
Kuriyama Mirai's gone.

674
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:16,920
She used up all of her blood in a bid to save you

675
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,830
and took the shade beyond the horizon with her
when she vanished from this world.

676
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,790
Are you saying she's dead?

677
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:40,510
He hasn't eaten anything for
three whole months, after all.

678
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,700
Anyway, what do you make of this as a dreamshade?

679
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,420
Akkey says he hears noises coming from the sky.

680
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:49,880
The shade inside Kanbara-kun was
the one from beyond the horizon.

681
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:55,130
Considerin' how powerful
the shade released from him was,

682
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:58,020
ain't it strange he's the only one
who can hear it at all?

683
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,900
The only plausible explanation is that the shade itself is causing this.

684
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,070
Hiro'omi.

685
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,940
Where can I find Izumi-san?

686
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,970
Only someone from the cursed bloodline could've brought down the shade from beyond the horizon.

687
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,510
That's all.

688
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:18,710
But then we ran into a problem.

689
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,330
Kuriyama Mirai said that she didn't want to kill you.

690
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,960
So I reluctantly told her of
\ha way to save you instead—

691
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,720
one that would only be effective during the lull.

692
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,120
Did you really think that explanation would satisfy me?

693
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,350
Surely you knew she'd pick that option!

694
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,770
That's right.

695
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,630
Resent me if you must.

696
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:44,360
But as a member of the Nase family,
I was duty-bound to keep everyone safe.

697
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,110
To keep this world safe.

698
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,430
Likewise, Kuriyama Mirai also had something she wanted to protect.

699
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,660
Something she valued more than her own life.

700
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,170
Something she was willing to die to protect.

701
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:01,170
And she did so of her own free will.

702
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,360
I am indebted to her.

703
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,300
If she hadn't made the choice she did,

704
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,670
we wouldn't be here right now.

705
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:15,180
In fact, neither would the rest of the world.

706
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:20,180
Toward the end, she said you'd probably be
upset with her when you woke up.

707
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,210
"Serves him right," she said.

708
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,070
The days are getting shorter and shorter, aren't they?

709
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,700
I thought it'd be easier in a dream,

710
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,830
but it's harder than I expected.

711
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,580
Goodbye.

712
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,590
What the hell?

713
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,930
If it's Mirai you want, she never came home.

714
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,430
Inami-san...

715
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:02,940
Where is she?

716
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,860
Tell me! Where is she?!

717
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,250
I don't want to see...

718
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,760
I don't want to see that pathetic back of yours.

Right now, I don't even know if you'll ever get the chance to read this.

841
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:11,550
Senpai, Kuriyama Mirai here.

842
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:17,940
I'm on my way to see you.

843
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,240
And then, I'll defeat the
shade from beyond the horizon.

844
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:30,810
I'm feeling a little strange right now.

845
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,990
I actually feel kind of happy.

846
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:43,540
Born to a clan with a cursed bloodline,
my life up until now has been anything but nice.

847
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:47,920
I always wondered why I was born,

848
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,160
and some part of me always felt
I was better off dead.

849
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:54,820
But I was sorely mistaken.

850
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:58,800
Now I'm glad I came into this world.

851
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:03,720
My powers were said to be cursed.

852
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,200
They were despised and scorned.

853
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:12,240
However, I now know they were meant not to hurt people, but to save them.

854
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,900
So I'm really glad I held on
long enough to see this day.

855
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:23,140
I'm really glad I came to this town and met you.

856
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:29,180
As it turns out, I've been blessed all my life.

857
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,460
I wasn't cursed at all.

858
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,810
Senpai,

859
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:40,170
now you too can die a normal death one day.

860
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,220
So...

861
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,970
So, from now on,

862
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,590
please live a normal life.

863
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,290
Just like you told me back then.

864
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:55,190
Senpai, I...

865
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,940
don't feel unpleasant at all.

866
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,010
Senpai, you should be hiding!

867
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,400
Senpai,

868
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,040
I'll...

869
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:44,300
I'll protect you.

870
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:21,860
What's that thing in the sky?!

871
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,570
A dreamshade!

872
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,000
Nino-san?

873
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,660
Looks like we've got another carnival on our hands.

874
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,260
What on earth is this all about?!

875
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:40,840
Inami-san.

876
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:42,500
Look.

877
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,520
Akkey!

878
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,770
Hiro'omi?

879
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,680
What are you guys doing here?

880
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,930
Come to the
Literature Club
clubroom.

881
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:47,800
Come to the
Literature Club
clubroom.

882
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,930
P.S. Kuriyama
Mirai's alive.

883
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:47,800
P.S. Kuriyama
Mirai's alive.

884
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:47,930
P.S. Kuriyama
Mirai's alive.

885
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:47,930
Come to the
Literature Club
clubroom.

886
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:48,050
P.S. Kuriyama
Mirai's alive.

887
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:48,050
Come to the
Literature Club
clubroom.

888
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,930
P.S. Kuriyama
Mirai's alive.

889
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,930
Come to the
Literature Club
clubroom.

890
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,620
We found these.

891
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,990
The dreamshade!

892
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,880
It's being sucked in.

893
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,070
Let's hurry.

894
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,270
Wait! Hold on a sec!

895
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:08,440
What?

896
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:08,970
No, get back!

897
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,450
Is it a trap?

898
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,200
Oh no!

899
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,480
Just get back!

900
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:17,580
Wh-What is...

901
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,710
Stay away! This thing's dangerous!

902
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,970
Wh-Whoops!

903
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,670
What the hell are you doing?!

904
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,180
This is no time to be messing around!

905
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,550
What was that for?

906
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:32,140
Here I'd made an amazing entrance—

907
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,230
This is what you do after showing up
for the first time in forever?!

908
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,710
Were you behind those letters as well?

909
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:38,440
What were you being so roundabout for?

910
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,040
You idiot!

911
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,940
Hey, it takes one to know one, you know.

912
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,080
Who's that?

913
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,980
Akkey's mother.

914
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:44,190
Really?

915
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,700
Is Kuriyama-san really alive?

916
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,890
Yes, she's alive.

917
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:52,550
Mirai-chan is fighting all by herself right now.

918
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:54,510
I'm not supposed to be helping you out,

919
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:58,070
but the world will end if the
shade beyond the horizon wins this battle.

920
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:01,960
So I decided to consider this an emergency and act accordingly.

921
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:04,920
Anyway, how can we save Kuriyama-san?

922
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,970
Before we get to that, let me ask you something.

923
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,220
Guys, do you wanna go to
\hwhere Kuriyama Mirai is—

924
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,430
Lay off the nonsense and just tell us already!

925
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:17,270
Okay, okay.

926
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,140
Down there.

927
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,520
A shadestone?

928
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:26,820
What is this?

929
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:30,780
Don't tell me...

930
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,510
Right.

931
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,030
This stone is a part of Akkun.

932
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,250
In other words, it's also a part of
the shade from beyond the horizon.

933
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,190
Inside that shade is something Kuriyama Mirai created:

934
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:07,110
a puppet of Akihito formed by her intense emotions.

935
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:10,110
Grab hold of it with everything you've got.

936
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,620
That shadestone will do the rest.

937
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,620
How do you know all this?

938
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,980
Who do you think I am?

939
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,130
I'm your mother—the Kanbara Yayoi.

940
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:34,200
Someday you'll have to tell me all about myself. Got that?

941
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,780
Jeez, that made me jump!

942
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,900
Kanbara Yayoi!

943
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,750
Don't scare me like that, Izumin!

944
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,020
Now, hurry up and go!

945
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,350
Wait.

946
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,760
What do you plan to do
once you get there?

947
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,770
You're no longer...

948
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:49,280
...immortal.

949
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,320
I know.

950
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:58,540
But I'm still a pervert who's willing to do anything for the sake of glasses and bespectacled beauties!

951
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:02,000
Kodoku na hoho wo nurasu

952
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:02,000
My cheeks are stained with tears

953
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,360
Tears of solitude

954
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,360
Nurasu kedo

955
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:06,040
Sorry to say this, but it's our turn now.

956
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:09,400
But I can sense the coming of dawn

957
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:09,400
Yoake no kehai ga shizuka ni michite

958
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:11,800
How unusual for you to cave.

959
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:14,760
Watashi wo sora e maneku yo

960
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:14,760
It beckons me to the skies

961
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:13,340
Kanbara-senpai!

962
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,830
Keep your dropkick ready and waiting!

963
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,880
Kibou ga kanata de matteru

964
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,880
Hope's waiting for me on the other side

965
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:17,910
I'll bring her back for sure!

966
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:23,150
That is why I'll fly

967
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:23,150
Sou da yo iku yo

968
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:19,640
Okay!

969
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,760
Mayoi nagara mo

970
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,760
Despite losing my way

971
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,260
Kimi wo sagasu tabi

972
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,260
I continue to look for you

973
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:35,600
My hands sense the thoughts you left behind

974
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:35,600
Surechigau ishiki te ga fureta yo ne

975
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:41,860
I'll grab hold of you and never let go

976
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:41,860
Tsukamaeru yo shikkari

977
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,960
Two hearts seeking each other

978
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,960
Motome au kokoro

979
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,840
Sore wa yume no akashi

980
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,840
That's what dreams are made of

981
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:56,470
Tagai wo uketomeru tabi ni hikareteku

982
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:56,470
Supporting one another draws us closer every time

983
01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:01,230
We don't need to live lives of sorrow anymore

984
01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:01,230
Kanashii hibi wa mou iranai

985
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:06,560
Tagai wo uketomete ikiru yorokobi ni

986
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:06,560
There's joy in supporting one another as you live

987
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:11,110
Kitto kitto futari

988
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:11,110
I'm sure the two of us

989
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:09,480
Kuriyama-san!

990
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:16,370
Mezameru yo

991
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:16,370
Will come to realize that

992
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,960
Mayoi nagara mo

993
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,960
Despite losing my way

994
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:25,980
Kimi wo mitsuketa yo

995
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:25,980
I found you

996
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,010
Senpai?

997
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,520
Kuriyama-san...

998
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,270
Serves you right!

999
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:56,830
Senpai?

1000
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:57,840
Why?

1001
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,950
Why did you come here?

1002
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:02,790
Now everything I did was in vain!

1003
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:03,910
Why do you think I—

1004
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:05,410
Shut up!

1005
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,090
"Live on"?

1006
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:11,670
"Become a normal person"?

1007
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:13,380
Who the hell wished for that?

1008
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,830
Who the hell asked for that crap?!

1009
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,100
How unpleasant!

1010
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,220
How utterly unpleasant!

1011
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,380
I'm the one who should be feeling unpleasant!

1012
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,890
Anyway, I refuse to stand for this!

1013
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,430
I don't want a life that was
built on your sacrifice.

1014
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,320
A future like that...

1015
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,520
holds no meaning at all!

1016
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,360
Why don't you understand that?!

1017
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:38,030
Why was that so difficult for you to understand?

1018
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,650
Jeez!

1019
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:51,960
How can anyone call that
absurd thing a dreamshade?

1020
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,940
Don't ask me!

1021
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,550
You were the one who was harboring it to begin with!

1022
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,100
That's just the core.

1023
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,450
In truth, everything around us was inside you.

1024
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,580
Senpai,

1025
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:09,600
have you come up with anything yet?

1026
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:11,460
What do you mean?

1027
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,900
Like a weakness or something!

1028
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,610
You know, maybe it has
sensitive armpits like you.

1029
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:18,690
Armpits?

1030
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:19,820
Where exactly?!

1031
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:23,520
Then... do you have something you hate?

1032
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,700
Anything will do.

1033
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,680
Something I hate, huh?

1034
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:29,790
Capelin with roe?

1035
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:34,750
Capelin with roe!

1036
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,500
Think it's mad now?

1037
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,630
Don't ask me!

1038
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,640
Kuriyama-san!

1039
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,550
Did you just do that?

1040
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:08,740
I think so.

1041
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:12,210
Wait, you have a shade hand now?

1042
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:21,060
That shadestone was a part of the
shade beyond the horizon—a part of you?

1043
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:26,510
Senpai, you hold a part of its powers in your hand right now!

1044
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,930
I'm not sure how we'll manage,

1045
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:32,770
but if you can stand up to it...

1046
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:36,250
...then it might be worth getting closer.

1047
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,030
On the handlebar?!

1048
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:45,320
There are dreamshades up ahead.

1049
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,860
From below, too!

1050
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:55,760
Way to go, Kuriyama-san!

1051
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,310
So do I just keep going straight?

1052
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:00,030
I don't know.

1053
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:01,920
But you better go as fast as you can!

1054
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:03,840
After all,

1055
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:07,140
it's too late to hit the brakes!

1056
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:10,390
Senpai!

1057
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:29,980
No way!

1058
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:42,300
Senpai!

1059
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:50,090
That was absurd.

1060
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:52,640
This whole place is absurd.

1061
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,750
In other words,

1062
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,300
you're absurd.

1063
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:55,890
Me?!

1064
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,980
Somehow we made it, though.

1065
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:04,080
Where are we?

1066
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:06,100
Huh?

1067
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,740
Our opponent's in a panic too.

1068
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:11,620
You can tell?

1069
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,210
I can't.

1070
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:16,140
But that's how I feel.

1071
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:18,620
I'm sure things will work out!

1072
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:21,130
That's kind of unlike you.

1073
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:24,030
I don't know what you're talking about.

1074
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,810
That said,

1075
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,470
I, Kuriyama Mirai,

1076
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:32,890
am feeling optimistic to an unpleasant degree!

1077
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,500
Go for it, Kuriyama-san!

1078
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:33,110
Kuriyama-san...

1079
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:34,490
Akkey...

1080
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:42,880
Kuriyama-san?

1081
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,670
Kuriyama-san.

1082
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:45,960
Kuriyama-san!

1083
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:50,970
Don't kill us.

1084
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:52,220
Disgusting.

1085
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:54,220
I'm so scared.

1086
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,380
You monster.

1087
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:54,220
Don't kill us.

1088
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:56,470
Are these my memories?

1089
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,930
Senpai?

1090
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,370
Wh-What's going on?

1091
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:09,190
It's probably something similar to what showed up back in the Hollow Shadow.

1092
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:11,460
Close your eyes, Kuriyama-san.

1093
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,320
Just do it.

1094
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:14,700
Okay!

1095
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,270
Don't be swayed.

1096
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:26,230
They say that dreamshades are formed from the twisted human heart and the hatred within, right?

1097
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:30,320
Well, this is a manifestation of the weakness in our hearts.

1098
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:33,550
Didn't I tell you back when we first met?

1099
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,250
I told you that the same goes for me.

1100
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:39,720
I'm here by your side.

1101
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,720
We met each other.

1102
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,190
You're not alone anymore.

1103
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:48,190
Senpai!

1104
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,690
Open your eyes.

1105
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,320
W-What...

1106
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:00,620
The hell?

1107
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,030
Let's take them out.

1108
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,500
All of them?

1109
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,160
Do you have a better idea?

1110
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,620
How unpleasant.

1111
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:23,740
Did we get them all?

1112
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:24,910
Who knows?

1113
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,250
Pretty, isn't it?

1114
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:35,820
Y-Yeah.

1115
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:45,610
What are you so terrified of?

1116
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,880
It's okay.

1117
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,060
Every last bit of you is me.

1118
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:54,190
All of it used to be inside me.

1119
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:57,500
Including that sickening envy,

1120
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:02,620
the despair over the fact that I'll never be human,

1121
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:04,990
the sorrow of being abandoned,

1122
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:06,580
and the regret over hurting someone!

1123
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:08,750
Senpai...

1124
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:13,920
And the selfishness, doubt, hatred, resignation, pettiness, and self-preserving attitude!

1125
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:18,400
I won't let any of it outside!

1126
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,800
It all belongs to me!

1127
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,300
I'll be the one to carry it all!

1128
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:30,100
I'm the immortal half-shade, you know?

1129
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:43,540
Senpai...

1130
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:54,750
Senpai,

1131
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:58,280
could you come over here?

1132
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,010
I'm sorry.

1133
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,010
Er, um, uh...

1134
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:08,140
I have...

1135
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:10,140
a request...

1136
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,420
A request?

1137
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:15,690
Um...

1138
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:19,540
Please hold out your hand.

1139
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:20,400
My hand?

1140
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:22,170
Yes.

1141
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:32,290
Please pat my head.

1142
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:35,580
I want you to pat my head.

1143
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:48,140
Kuriyama-san...

1144
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,390
Say "thank you."

1145
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,740
Thank you.

1146
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:58,200
Say it like you mean it.

1147
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,530
Thank you.

1148
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:08,950
So happy...

1149
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:12,120
I'm so happy!

1150
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,080
Kuriyama-san!

1151
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,460
I'm so happy!

1152
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,670
I'm so happy!

1153
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:21,150
Kuriyama-san, your legs...

1154
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:25,010
The shade beyond the horizon
has gone back to you,

1155
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:28,580
So this place will crumble away soon,

1156
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:30,390
and I'll probably disappear along with it.

1157
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:35,250
Now that it's gone back to you,

1158
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:38,000
I won't be able to exist.

1159
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,820
The real me is long gone, after all.

1160
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:45,190
I'm truly glad to have met you!

1161
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:45,740
Stop it!

1162
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:49,740
I'm truly glad to have fallen in love with you—

1163
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:51,160
Stop! Don't say it!

1164
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:56,660
Thank you so very much!

1165
01:13:58,210 --> 01:13:59,830
Kuriyama-san!

1166
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:02,210
Hang on! This can't be happening!

1167
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:04,630
Kuriyama-san!

1168
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,720
Kuriyama-san!

1169
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,700
Nobody knows if this was all predestined from the start,

1170
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:30,280
or if it only happened thanks to Kuriyama-san's efforts.

1171
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,620
But I definitely want to believe it was the latter.

1172
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:38,080
Anyway, the shade from beyond the horizon came back to me,

1173
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:41,170
and peace was restored to the world.

1174
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:44,270
100 yen? Are you for real?!

1175
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:45,860
I'm off!

1176
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:47,760
Oh, morning!

1177
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,920
Good morning.

1178
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,090
Be careful out there.

1179
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:53,050
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1180
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:54,050
She dozed off!

1181
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:57,220
Come on, Sakura-chan! Wake up!

1182
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:58,410
Dreamshades exist as they always have,

1183
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:02,730
and spirit hunters make a living off them as they always have.

1184
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:06,280
Ayaka-san and Ai-chan went back to their place, too.

1185
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:15,660
Banana
Au Lait

1186
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:15,660
80% Milk

1187
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:10,070
Fujima Miroku went missing.

1188
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:16,830
One thing did change: Hiro'omi replaced Izumi-san as the head of the Nase family.

1189
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:19,600
But that didn't affect our lives much.

1190
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,580
Nee-san...

1191
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:24,110
One day, you will also come to understand.

1192
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:26,970
Forgive me.

1193
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:31,380
As usual, Mitsuki remains cooped up in the clubroom and showers me with verbal abuse.

1194
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:31,380
Literature Club

1195
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:37,640
If you know that good will prevail over evil in the end,
isn't it a waste of time to continue reading?

1196
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,740
That's what entertainment's all about, don't you think?

1197
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,140
Cut it out!

1198
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:44,980
Hey, it's only natural to keep one's hands warm in winter.

1199
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,780
There's nothing strange about what I'm doing.

1200
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:48,070
It's totally creepy-crawly!

1201
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:49,120
Three out of ten.

1202
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:55,570
However, Kuriyama Mirai's no longer here.

1203
01:15:56,210 --> 01:16:00,010
In the end, I lost.

1204
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:02,210
TARGET: 50,000 YEN

1205
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:04,210
A future built on Kuriyama Mirai's sacrifice holds no meaning at all.

1206
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:10,700
That's what I yelled out back then, but here I am, having accepted—and living in—that very future.

1207
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,890
I'm sure this is what Kuriyama-san's saying right about now:

1208
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:15,980
"Serves you right."

1209
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,430
How unpleasant.

1210
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,270
I...

1211
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:27,100
still have you.

1212
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,780
Just as there is light even at night,

1213
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:38,870
just as there are shadows during the day,

1214
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:42,120
the world will never be free of darkness.

1215
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:45,870
At the same time, it will also never be overcome by it.

1216
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:52,480
Dyed in that half-baked hue, the universe will continue to move on and set events in motion.

1217
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,220
And in the midst of all that, I...

1218
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:14,890
Seijaku wo kirisaku you

1219
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:14,890
Tearing the silence to shreds

1220
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:17,950
Otozureta no wa

1221
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:17,950
The time has come

1222
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,490
U-Um...

1223
01:17:17,950 --> 01:17:20,490
Hitsuzen to shite no kaikou

1224
01:17:17,950 --> 01:17:20,490
For us to cross paths

1225
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:23,670
It's a meeting we were fated to have

1226
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:23,670
Bokura no tame ni

1227
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,540
Bespectacled...

1228
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:28,570
My eyes filled with regret, I see you

1229
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:28,570
Koukai wo nageku me ni utsuru kimi wa sou

1230
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:29,290
Basically, I love the bespectacled Kuriyama-san!

1231
01:17:28,570 --> 01:17:31,310
Urei wo matotte

1232
01:17:28,570 --> 01:17:31,310
Clad in anguish

1233
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:34,890
Utsukushiku saita

1234
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:34,890
Blossoming beautifully

1235
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:39,510
Dareka no seimei ni tokeru hana

1236
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:39,510
I can see the flower bringing joy to people's lives

1237
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:45,450
Nee kimi ni mo mieru darou

1238
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:45,450
Can you see it too?

1239
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:43,850
How unpleasant.

1240
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:46,700
Nobody knows if this was all predestined from the start,

1241
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:47,270
Kitto

1242
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:47,270
I'm sure you can

1243
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,440
or if it only happened thanks to Kuriyama-san's efforts.

1244
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:54,730
Let's paint over all the mistakes we've made

1245
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:54,730
Kasaneta ayamachi nurikaeyou

1246
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:54,940
Maybe my feelings for Kuriyama-san reached her.

1247
01:17:54,730 --> 01:18:00,290
Nando demo ii sa kurikaeshiteku Start Line

1248
01:17:54,730 --> 01:18:00,290
We'll start over and over again until we succeed

1249
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:58,620
And that's how I reunited with Kuriyama Mirai.

1250
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:02,890
If our story had ended after a reunion like that,

1251
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:05,970
Kako to wa chigau asu wo

1252
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:05,970
For the sake of a fresh future

1253
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:06,830
I don't think any story in this world would be worth telling.

1254
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:11,890
Futari dake no kibou egaku Start Line

1255
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:11,890
We'll start realizing our very own hopes and dreams

1256
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:09,840
Oh right, Kuriyama-san.

1257
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,450
You forgot something.

1258
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:15,420
I never say goodbye

1259
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:15,420
I have never said goodbye

1260
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,510
Itsudatte sou sa

1261
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,510
And I never will

1262
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:20,840
Could you do me a favor and put these glasses on?

1263
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,860
Continuing crystallization of proof

1264
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,860
Keizoku shite iku shoumei to shite no kesshou

1265
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,710
Beyond the Boundary

1266
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:34,520
Honoka ni yureru hi wo yadoshite

1267
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:34,520
Sheltering a faintly flickering flame

1268
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:39,760
Past Volume

1269
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,660
Kousai wo hanatsu mirai

1270
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,660
Emblazoned with a future radiating brilliance

1271
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:40,170
Yakitsuketa kimi no me wa sukoshi kanashisou de

1272
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:40,170
Your eyes seem to hold a little bit of sadness

1273
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:42,930
Take a look into my eyes

1274
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:45,860
Wipe away that final tear

1275
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:45,860
Saigo no hitoshizuku wo nugutte

1276
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:48,580
Every time you wanna see call me

1277
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:48,580
Every time you wanna see me, call me

1278
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:51,470
Saisho ni deatta ano basho de sa

1279
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:51,470
I’ll be at the place where we first met

1280
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:55,700
Chiriyuku unmei ni aragatte

1281
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:55,700
Fight against the fate that befalls you

1282
01:18:55,700 --> 01:19:01,650
Sou azayaka ni sakihokore

1283
01:18:55,700 --> 01:19:01,650
Yeah, bloom vibrantly, with glory

1284
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:04,290
Always

1285
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:10,900
Connected to your singing voice

1286
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:10,900
Kimi no utau koe to tsunagaru you

1287
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:16,560
Kokoro no oku narihibiita boku no ne

1288
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:16,560
My sound rings out and echoes deep within my heart

1289
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:22,260
Inori ni ukabu asu wa

1290
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:22,260
The tomorrow that surfaces in my prayer

1291
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:27,620
Ikiru imi wo kibou ni kaeru kara

1292
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:27,620
Transforms a reason to live into hope

1293
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:32,250
I wanna be with you

1294
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,500
Nido to wa nai ima no genjitsu wo

1295
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,500
To make a sacrifice to gain possession of

1296
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:38,110
This present reality, impossible to repeat

1297
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:38,110
Te ni ireru tame no gisei nante

1298
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:40,900
Kesshite kodoku to ketsubetsu shikirenai

1299
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:40,900
The act is unbreakably bound to loneliness

1300
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,980
Ima no boku ni hakarenai

1301
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,980
I can’t measure that weight as I am now

1302
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,740
Sore demo ii nda

1303
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,740
But even so, that’s fine

1304
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:47,550
Hibikiwatare inori yo

1305
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:47,550
Echo far and wide, my prayer

1306
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:51,010
Our reverberating singing voices

1307
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:51,010
Kodama suru bokura no utagoe

1308
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:53,610
Issun no hikari wo egaita

1309
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:53,610
Painted a momentary light

1310
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:56,460
Terashidasu ichirin no hana yo

1311
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:56,460
Illuminating a single flower

1312
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:59,940
Kimi to futari te wo tsunaide

1313
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:59,940
I want to keep our hands connected

1314
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:02,130
Zutto itai nda

1315
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:02,130
And always be with you

1316
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:04,090
I can't hear you...

1317
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,370
I can't hear you...

1318
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:34,410
Who...

1319
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:43,130
Kuriyama-san?

1320
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:48,140
Who...

1321
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:49,640
Am I?

1322
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:57,330
Kuriyama-

1323
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:58,100
Who...

1324
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:01,610
Are you?

1325
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,370
Kuriyama-san...
