00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:49,458
Captain Sakaki, please reply. </font>We can communicate.</font></font>

3
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,083
My demand is to leave the planet Tau-e immediately,</font></font>

4
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,542
and abandon the project migration.</font></font>

5
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,792
Until I hear from Captain, I'm not moving from here.</font></font>

6
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:02,958
Migration decision Tau-e made by the Central Committee.</font></font>

7
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:07,125
Your intervention will be classified as a first offense.</font></font>

8
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,875
People will not exist on the planet!</font></font>

9
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:13,792
If I was a criminal, then the members of the Committee are killer!</font></font>

10
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:14,833
Look this.</font></font>

11
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:18,542
This migration list include volunteers.</font></font>

12
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:20,042
Why do you interfere?</font></font>

13
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:20,958
Shut!</font></font>

14
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:25,917
You gather the old men and women, pressed them, and call that volunteer activities?</font></font>

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,958
I'll kill them!</font></font>

16
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,208
All you want to do is reduce the mouth to eat!</font></font>

17
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,875
Watch your words, Captain!</font></font>

18
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,375
We are communicating through an open channel.</font></font>

19
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,083
Tất cả mọi người trên con tàu này có thể nghe chúng ta, đúng không?

20
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:43,792
Ngay bây giờ, con tàu này đang cố gắng để từ bỏ những người cao tuổi.

21
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,792
Chúng tôi có thể thiếu tài nguyên.

22
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:48,125
Nhưng điều này có thể được tha thứ?

23
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,625
Chúng tôi đã không tìm kiếm đất hứa sẽ cứu chúng ta?

24
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:57,125
Bạn có thể thực sự từ bỏ những yếu kém và tiếp tục giữ đầu của bạn lên cao?

25
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,125
Thuyền trưởng Sakaki.

26
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,042
Tôi sẽ chờ đợi một giờ.

27
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:05,875
Nếu con tàu này không thay đổi khóa học, tôi sẽ thổi lên đưa đón này.

28
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:07,917
Tao không đùa!

29
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,292
Làm ơn dừng lại đã, thuyền trưởng Sakaki.

30
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:22,375
Đó là sự thật mà chúng tôi, các tình nguyện viên, thực sự muốn đi tàu-e.

31
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,958
Chúng tôi không phải bị đuổi ra hoặc bất cứ điều gì.

32
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,458
Đừng dại dột! Điều này là tự sát!

33
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,625
Chúng tôi đã trên con tàu này trong hơn 20 năm trong khi lang thang qua không gian.

34
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,708
Những người trẻ tuổi có thể chịu đựng điều này.

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,542
Nhưng đối với chúng tôi, chúng tôi giới hạn của chúng tôi.

36
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:45,292
Nhưng... nếu bạn từ bỏ, sau đó...

37
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,542
Haruo.

38
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,250
-.. .thì nó là tất cả hơn! -Haruo!

39
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:51,542
Không sao đâu.

40
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:56,208
Ít nhất, khi tôi chết, tôi muốn đứng trên mặt đất.

41
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,583
Nó có thể trên bất kỳ hành tinh.

42
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,417
Ông nội.

43
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:38,125
HÀNH TINH CỦA QUÁI VẬT

44
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,500
Nó bắt đầu vào cuối mùa hè của thế kỷ 20.

45
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,375
Nhìn vào mà! Đó là một con quái vật! Đây là một cảnh không thể tin được.

46
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,708
Lần đầu tiên...

47
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:59,917
nhân loại nhận ra họ không phải là những người cai trị của hành tinh này nữa.

48
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,542
Con quái vật.

49
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:11,000
Từ độ sâu của trái đất và biển, hoặc thậm chí từ một huyền thoại thần thánh bị lãng quên,

50
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,708
họ giữ xuất hiện, không ngừng.

51
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,125
Nhằm đem lại một kết thúc với sự thịnh vượng của nhân loại.

52
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,125
HQ Countermeasure của Liên Hiệp Quốc đã đặt tên cho nó "Godzilla."

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,208
Và sau đó, cuối cùng, cơn ác mộng tồi tệ nhất của chúng tôi xuất hiện.

54
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,208
Godzilla.

55
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,958
Con người hay quái vật, nó đốt tất cả mọi thứ trong tầm nhìn.

56
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,542
Avatar phá hủy.

57
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:39,792
Lúc 2:30 EST, một cuộc tấn công hạt nhân quy mô lớn được tung ra chống lại Godzilla, nhưng thất bại.

58
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:45,708
Lúc nửa đêm, lực lượng đồng minh EC đã thông báo họ đã bắt đầu sơ tán...

59
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:48,500
Trái đất sụp đổ và bầu trời mưa lửa.

60
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:55,417
Và sau đó, nó không phải chỉ con người trái đất những người sợ sức mạnh phá hoại của nó.

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,750
Ở trên Liên Hiệp Quốc xây dựng, bí ẩn các đối tượng đang bay...

62
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,250
Người dân của trái đất, chúng tôi là Exif.

63
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,125
Chúng tôi đang quan sát và dự đoán.

64
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,042
Chúng tôi đã đến để nói với bạn về số phận của bạn.

65
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:12,792
Thời gian hủy diệt là hô. Bạn phải khám phá ra một con đường để cống hiến.

66
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,875
Chúng tôi là Bilusaludo.

67
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,167
Hành tinh của chúng tôi, hành tinh thứ ba trong các Bilusaludia nhị phân hệ thống,

68
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,500
nuốt chửng bởi một lỗ đen accursed và bị phá hủy.

69
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:27,458
Chúng tôi đang yêu cầu nhập cư đến hành tinh thứ ba này hệ thống năng lượng mặt trời.

70
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:34,500
Nếu bạn chấp nhận, chúng tôi hứa hẹn để diệt trừ mối đe dọa lớn nhất của bạn, Godzilla.

71
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:39,417
Những người từ một thiên hà xa, những người sau khi hành tinh xanh này cho mình,

72
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,625
không đợi thiên đường này của oxy và nước để trở thành đất scorched.

73
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,875
-Godzilla đã thông qua các đường dây quốc phòng! -Các bức tường sẽ cung cấp cho chúng tôi một thời gian.

74
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,792
A3 và A5 khối AIs là im lặng!

75
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,083
-Mecha-Godzilla sẽ không kích hoạt! -Tại sao nó sẽ không kích hoạt?

76
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,542
Nguyên tử hơi thở phát hiện! Đến!

77
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,125
Thiết giáp tường thứ tư rồi! Mọi chuyện đã xong!

78
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,750
Chúng tôi không có lựa chọn. Di tản!

79
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,417
Tất cả các đơn vị, di tản! Nhanh lên!

80
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,167
Đợi! Nếu chúng ta có thể kích hoạt Mecha-Godzilla, chúng tôi có thể đánh bại nó!

81
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,667
Chúng ta đi, Galu-gu!

82
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:12,250
Tuy nhiên, ngay cả với hợm thu thập tình báo,

83
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,167
quyền lực của tàu khu trục choáng ngợp với chúng tôi hoàn toàn.

84
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,875
Mẹ và cha ở đâu?

85
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:35,208
Họ sẽ bắt kịp sớm. Thấy không? Đó là xe buýt.

86
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,708
Hey, đó là cái gì?

87
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,125
Godzilla là nó!

88
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,792
Godzilla của ở đây!

89
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,417
Haruo! Khẩn trương lên!

90
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,917
Tôi nhớ những ngọn lửa đốt cháy trên bầu trời,

91
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,375
và chìm đắm, despaired khuôn mặt của người lớn.

92
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,083
Chúng tôi rời với hy vọng sẽ tìm thấy hành tinh inhabitable.

93
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:50,875
Tuy nhiên, chúng tôi sẽ sớm phải trả giá cho lạc quan ngu ngốc như vậy.

94
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,708
Trong không gian đông lạnh, màu đen,

95
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,500
đây là một loại địa ngục tồi tệ hơn so với hành tinh chúng ta phá hủy trong lửa.

96
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:12,292
Có những ngày vô tận của đau khổ từ nạn đói, khát, và cảm lạnh.

97
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,250
Một số ngã bệnh.

98
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,875
Và những người khác dần dần mất đi sự tỉnh táo của họ.

99
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,750
Anh trai chúng tôi con số giảm mạnh trong nháy mắt.

100
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:34,375
Thậm chí, những người vẫn còn sống không có thời gian để tang người chết.

101
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:40,125
Nhân ái và niềm tự hào đang xa xưa những câu chuyện của quá khứ.

102
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:51,708
Một câu chuyện cổ tích từ thời gian chúng tôi từng có quyền truy cập không giới hạn vào nước và ôxy.

103
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:57,083
Chúng ta đi đâu... và vì lý do gì?

104
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:03,208
Chúng tôi phải chịu đựng đau khổ của việc có kéo dài cuộc sống của chúng tôi

105
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,708
bằng cách hy sinh những người khác?

106
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,083
Tại sao chúng ta đang sống?

107
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,667
Tại sao?

108
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,667
Tại sao?

109
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,958
Bạn đã có một cơn ác mộng?

110
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:34,125
Vì vậy, bạn đang ở đây, là Metphies.

111
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,333
Nó cũng là công việc của tôi để lắng nghe lời thú nhận của một tù nhân.

112
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,750
Vì vậy, tôi có nên ăn năn với Đức Chúa trời của bạn?

113
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,208
Tôi sẽ giải quyết cho một lời thú nhận giả, quá.

114
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,875
Dưới đây là các dữ liệu mà bạn yêu cầu.

115
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,375
Cảm ơn bạn.

116
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,167
Bạn có khá kiên trì.

117
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:58,708
Tôi không có bất cứ điều gì khác để làm.

118
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,125
Bạn sẽ không nhận được vào rắc rối nếu họ tìm ra bạn đang giúp đỡ?

119
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,125
Tôi có một quan tâm đến sự nhiệt tình của bạn.

120
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,208
Tại sao các bạn rất tò mò về đào lên dữ liệu bị Cấm

121
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:12,500
bất cứ ai cũng sẽ không muốn quên tồn tại?

122
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,958
"Tại sao," bạn yêu cầu?

123
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:18,708
Tôi cũng đang nghĩ "tại sao."

124
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:24,417
Kể từ khi tôi đã ném ra đây, từ đó sẽ không nhận được ra khỏi đầu của tôi.

125
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,667
Tại sao chúng tôi đã trở thành đau khổ như vậy?

126
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,833
Nó là không thể tránh khỏi? Một hình phạt hợp lý?

127
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:33,958
Không.

128
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:38,667
Lý do chúng tôi đang đau khổ là vì chúng ta thua thằng khốn đó.

129
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:42,042
Chúng tôi đã không chiến đấu để kết thúc, nhưng đã từ bỏ và bỏ trốn.

130
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,208
Tất cả mọi thứ là số phận.

131
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:51,083
Chúng tôi hợm không có cách để chiến đấu quái vật đó.

132
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,750
Tôi không đồng ý.

133
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,833
Và tôi sẽ cho họ.

134
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:04,375
Chúng tôi chỉ cần phải chiến lược và lập kế hoạch,

135
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,542
và nhân loại có thể đã đánh bại nó.

136
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,125
Tôi sẽ chứng minh điều đó.

137
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,208
Đó là một điều lạ.

138
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:19,333
Không giống như những người trẻ tuổi, thế hệ của bạn có kinh nghiệm firsthand tai.

139
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:26,875
And yet, it's as if you want to see that creature again.

140
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:37,125
Based on the Gematron calculation, the predictions look disappointing.

141
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:43,792
The possibility of finding a habitable planet in 20 years is 0.1%.

142
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:48,125
If we want better results than Tau-e, the outlook is even grimmer.

143
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,500
The lack of resources is severe.

144
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:56,083
Even doubling the discomfort index, life will be unsustainable in eight years.

145
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,292
The landing ship explosion the other day was a significant psychological blow.

146
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,292
- This is getting... - Indeed.

147
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,042
We need to examine scenario number three in a realistic way.

148
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,500
Returning to Earth. It's already 11.9 light years away.

149
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,417
There's no precedent for traveling so far. It's too risky.

150
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,333
Gematron's guidance isn't bound by time or distance.

151
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,583
As long as the nuclear reactor has sufficient energy, travel is possible.

152
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:29,167
According to the ship's simulator, it requires 170% of its operation ratio.

153
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,958
I don't know if we can mobilize the manpower.

154
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:36,083
Would it be a constructive decision to abandon the emigration?

155
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,458
That's the problem.

156
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,042
If we return to Earth, would we be able to survive?

157
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,958
It is currently impossible to calculate how much time has passed on Earth.

158
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,292
At the very least, a few thousand years.

159
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:54,083
Since we fled Earth, the environment should have calmed down.

160
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,667
It's possible it could've gotten worse.

161
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:03,625
The problem is that strange thesis published on the shared server.

162
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:07,875
Why would that research thesis appear at a time like this?

163
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,417
The writer remains anonymous,

164
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,458
but it contains information that requires special log-in credentials to access.

165
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,958
The author aside, there's probably an informant in the Central Committee.

166
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:22,292
R-Ridiculous!

167
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:29,292
There's an electromagnetic shield under the body's surface?

168
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,917
It's not a normal organism?

169
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,292
No, its whole body is like a giant coil.

170
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:35,958
Is that true?

171
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,208
So, what happened in the end?

172
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,583
It's kind of weird.

173
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:44,083
A new Gematron code is using 80% of the calculation server's power.

174
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:45,250
Eighty percent?

175
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,625
Isn't it the analysis for predictions?

176
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,083
Still, for a simulation, it's too much.

177
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,292
So, the rumor of returning to Earth is true?

178
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:57,292
It's 11.9 light years in one go.

179
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,625
Is a subspace jump-warp even possible?

180
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,542
It's not a problem if we use Gematron calculation.

181
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,750
I heard it directly from Navigation.

182
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,917
Gematron, huh?

183
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,833
The ship leaders turn to the gods, as usual.

184
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:15,375
Maybe even that new anti-Godzilla tactic was a leak from the higher-ups?

185
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:18,167
Man, are we going to fight it again?

186
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:23,042
It's a monster that withstood an attack of 150 nuclear warheads at once.

187
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,375
That's 40 megatons of nucleoplasm total.

188
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,833
But the thesis contained new strategies on how to fight it.

189
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:30,750
Huh?

190
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,333
It's me.

191
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,833
Hey, come in.

192
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:52,833
So, the Central Committee is leaning towards going to Earth, huh?

193
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,458
Not entirely.

194
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,042
To give up searching for a habitable planet

195
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,917
means someone has to bear that responsibility.

196
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:06,417
If they're so weak they give up drifting after only 20 years, it can't be helped.

197
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,958
Well, I do sympathize.

198
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:14,417
They haven't dealt with the loss of their home planet as long as we have.

199
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,958
And then, there's your practical joke.

200
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,875
Obviously, it's a headache for Mori.

201
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,000
I uploaded a new version this morning. Did you read it?

202
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:30,083
Yeah. When I downloaded it, it already had over 400 views.

203
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,167
Though the file was deleted three seconds later.

204
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:36,833
Our delinquent captain sure is popular.

205
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:41,917
When there's rumor of returning to Earth, we get more talk of Godzilla.

206
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,958
It's effective for ridiculing the Central Committee.

207
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,417
Haruo is unaware of the Central Committee's expectations.

208
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:53,042
He was researching Godzilla purely for personal interest.

209
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,500
But this thesis has content that will support our plan to return to Earth.

210
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:03,208
Its claim is that Godzilla can be defeated by human hands.

211
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:07,833
If you can't understand its contents, it just sounds like crazy prattling.

212
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,333
Earthlings harbor that much fear of Godzilla.

213
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,208
So, do you think it's just crazy prattling?

214
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,583
This analysis report?

215
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,708
No, it's actually quite interesting.

216
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,000
So much so, I think better of him.

217
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,417
Godzilla is not invincible.

218
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:30,083
It's humanity's fault for giving up on the fight.

219
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,208
That's what Haruo thinks.

220
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,958
He analyzed that old data because of you Exifs' Gematron calculation.

221
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,250
It was impossible for Earthlings at the time.

222
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,958
Are you saying that, if the weak-point analysis had been made in time,

223
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,458
that humanity still wouldn't have been victorious?

224
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,375
And if they did defeat Godzilla,

225
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:59,333
then it was only a matter of time until Exif's cult took over Earth.

226
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:03,583
Even if Bilusaludo's Mecha-Godzilla had defeated Godzilla,

227
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,958
no one knows who it would have bared its fangs at next.

228
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:14,583
However, we failed in the construction of Mecha-Godzilla.

229
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:18,083
And you couldn't brainwash Earthlings with your religion.

230
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,750
That's history now.

231
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,208
The what-ifs are only fairy tales.

232
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,250
Subspace jump-warp procedure, now entering phase two.

233
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,500
Activating shields for all ship sections.

234
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,917
Bypassing electricity for the gravitational coil engine.

235
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,250
Initiating Gematron calculation and gravitational coils controller.

236
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:45,208
Begin cluster connections with Gematron calculation crystal and central AI.

237
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,708
Gravitational coil engine for all sections functioning normally.

238
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,000
Preparations for spin complete.

239
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:54,167
Subspace coordinate system render will be displayed on the central hologram.

240
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,000
Attention all personnel.

241
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,750
This ship, Aratrum, will soon initiate subspace jump-warp.

242
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:04,250
Estimated emergence coordinates are near the solar system's third planet, Earth.

243
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:08,167
Based on the ship's time, 22 years have passed since our departure.

244
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,667
This subspace jump-warp will be the longest we've traversed.

245
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,292
Finally. The real Earth!

246
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,875
I wonder if we can see the ocean?

247
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,500
That'd be awesome if we can!

248
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:23,125
The longest? Is this really safe?

249
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,792
...no idea what changes Earth's environment has undergone.

250
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,042
After an investigation,

251
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,750
if we conclude the environment has become unfit for human survival,

252
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,458
we will collect resources...

253
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,833
Hey, is the real Earth prettier than the hologram?

254
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:39,708
Yes, it is.

255
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:44,750
Entering Gematron-predicted coordinates. Suspending main propulsion drive.

256
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:47,375
We now have all the Gematron numbers.

257
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,583
Irrational numbers converted to integers. Computing time-space recon point.

258
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:54,667
Chances of a wormhole appearing is 440% in a simulated observation.

259
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,167
Releasing gravitational coil output for each section of the ship.

260
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,125
Maximum spin.

261
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,042
Captain, on your order.

262
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,000
Initiate jump-warp.

263
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,375
Jump-warp initiated. Commence shift into phase one space travel.

264
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,583
Gravitational coil at max speed, running stable.

265
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:41,375
Arriving at launch point required for final trajectory.

266
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,000
Breaking through subspace.

267
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:12,333
Amazing.

268
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,875
Hey, it's really blue!

269
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,083
- That's the ocean? - It's beautiful.

270
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,667
That's Earth?

271
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,417
Yes, that's right.

272
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,958
It really is blue!

273
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:25,000
To think that I'd see it again.

274
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,375
Disabling shields in all sections. Normal travel mode stable.

275
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,167
Distance from Earth, 1,800 kilometers.

276
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,125
Recalculating low orbit entrance errors.

277
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,958
Our Earth that was taken from us.

278
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,500
Orbit errors corrected.

279
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,500
Now entering low Earth orbit.

280
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,750
If we can't land on Earth, we'll have a revolt on our hands.

281
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:58,333
It's too soon to be pessimistic.

282
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:01,250
Let's just wait for the scouting report.

283
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,750
Unmanned recon drones launching in sequence.

284
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:11,208
All drone feedback systems are stable.

285
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,542
Begin dispersion to specified areas for surveillance.

286
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:21,625
Entering the stratosphere. Drone temperature stable.

287
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,750
Altitude 30,000 meters, beginning descent.

288
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:30,625
Altitude 15,000 meters, entering the troposphere.

289
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:33,792
Stellar observation parallax calculated.

290
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,125
Elapsed time for the solar system is approximately 10,000 years.

291
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,667
It's been 10,000 years? That long?

292
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,375
It's more than I imagined.

293
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,167
This could be good news.

294
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,542
With that much time, the ecosystem must have changed.

295
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,667
Not even Godzilla...

296
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:48,875
I wonder.

297
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:51,542
It's possible it could've multiplied.

298
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,500
That thing is a genetic aberration. It's impossible!

299
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,708
Recon drones are at a scouting altitude of 2,000 meters.

300
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,083
Receiving visuals.

301
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,792
Drone six displaying sound signal monitor.

302
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,250
Just the sound of the wind?

303
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,625
We can't see anything. Can you lower the altitude?

304
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,000
All drones descending.

305
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,917
There are thick particles floating in the atmosphere.

306
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:18,625
Average visibility less than 300 meters.

307
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:22,458
This is... Picking up electromagnetic interference.

308
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,417
This isn't just a normal fog.

309
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,792
Switching drones to sensor monitors.

310
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,208
Each drone's altitude at 500 meters.

311
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:34,208
Atmospheric density is increasing.

312
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:36,917
Further descent by remote is impossible.

313
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,042
Is this a forest?

314
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,917
Or some kind of complicated terrain.

315
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,250
Can you increase the scan power?

316
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,625
Its reflection is diffused, so this is the limit.

317
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,542
What's that?

318
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:52,333
It's moving.

319
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,375
Drone six, switching to sound wave reconnaissance.

320
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:59,125
Temperature around drone six is increasing drastically!

321
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,792
- What? - What's happening?

322
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,958
Drone six, lost!

323
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,667
Estimated energy output around drone six approximately 180 gigawatts.

324
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,500
High probability of high-energy electron particles, or atomic breath!

325
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:26,417
M-Maybe it was thunder or...

326
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,833
Idiot! No one would ever forget that roar!

327
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:35,583
Damn it. It's still on this planet.

328
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,250
You're there, aren't you?

329
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,625
You're still there!

330
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:58,292
If the characteristics match this closely, then that was Godzilla,

331
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,875
or a threat similar to it, and it must be eliminated.

332
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:08,042
Our one advantage is that it acts independently rather than in a pack.

333
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:10,417
How can you say that for sure?

334
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,458
The concentration of radiation.

335
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:18,958
As you're aware, Godzilla is a creature that scatters heavy radiation in its wake.

336
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:23,458
However, even though the terrain has undergone change,

337
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:27,167
the toxins present in the atmosphere are maintaining stable numbers.

338
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,167
If we reverse calculate the emission data gathered in the past three days,

339
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:35,000
multiple Godzillas seem unlikely.

340
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:39,250
Even now, Godzilla is a unique genetic defect

341
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:43,917
and cannot be considered a normal living creature, is what I mean.

342
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,250
However, it's been 10,000 years. How can it still be alive?

343
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:52,417
There are cases where lotus seeds survived for 2,000 years.

344
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:57,167
It also may be repeating cycles of dormancy every few thousand years.

345
00:25:57,417 --> 00:26:00,125
Or, over 10,000 years, it could have multiplied

346
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:04,333
and diminished in number, with this being the last surviving one.

347
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:10,042
Godzilla's biology is beyond every known aspect of life science.

348
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:14,333
And we can't ignore the possibility that it could be immortal.

349
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:18,083
Studies and research aren't this meeting's main subject.

350
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:21,792
We humanoids cannot coexist with Godzilla.

351
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:26,500
However, if that is indeed Godzilla, and the last one,

352
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,833
then there is only one option.

353
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,667
Complete extermination.

354
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,250
Are you utterly insane?

355
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:40,500
As you are all aware, we have drafted anti-Godzilla strategies.

356
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:44,167
You mean that anonymous thesis?

357
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,375
We don't even know who wrote it!

358
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:51,125
It's from a specialist's investigation.

359
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,708
It's deemed as promising information.

360
00:26:53,917 --> 00:27:00,625
I am also prepared to release the name of the person who wrote it, right here.

361
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,833
However, there are conditions.

362
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,417
And what would those conditions be?

363
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,208
To drop the charges regarding the stolen secret information, and then...

364
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,208
release Captain Haruo Sakaki on bail.

365
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:17,167
Captain Sakaki? It was him?

366
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:20,417
You got us, Metphies.

367
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:26,083
All shall be according to God's will.

368
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,958
It's your turn.

369
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,833
Haruo.

370
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:49,958
It's here. This waveform is generating the electromagnetic metamaterial.

371
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:55,042
Since each of Godzilla's cells can function as a powerful electromagnet,

372
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,583
it emits a high-output, high-frequency electromagnetic pulse

373
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:01,583
and generates an asymmetrically permeable shield.

374
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,125
A physically impervious shield?

375
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:08,583
It may be enormous, but can a creature even do that?

376
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:12,792
And if that were true, how can we even begin to fight it?

377
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:17,583
It's only for about 1/10,000 of a second, but it emits a noise periodically.

378
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:20,833
If we use an interference wave, we can amplify that noise

379
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:25,917
to fracture the metamaterial, and we'll target that point.

380
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:31,375
So by attacking a single point, we can take that colossal thing down?

381
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:35,417
There should be an organ amplifying the electromagnetic pulse.

382
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,458
If we destroy that, we can neutralize the shield.

383
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,000
And where is it?

384
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,292
Unknown.

385
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,667
There isn't enough data in our visual records.

386
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:49,125
We need to observe Godzilla and analyze the emission pattern.

387
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,292
As you know from past battles,

388
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,125
we can confirm Godzilla has tremendous regenerative abilities.

389
00:28:56,625 --> 00:29:01,500
The destroyed organs will regenerate, and in the seconds before the shield goes up,

390
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:06,042
we need to shove an EMP probe into its body and destroy it from within.

391
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:09,875
The main issue with this operation is the changed atmosphere,

392
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,708
and the electromagnetic wave interference.

393
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:15,667
To observe and find Godzilla's weak point,

394
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,667
we need detailed coordination with accurate attacks,

395
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,167
so close quarters combat is required.

396
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,875
And for each process,

397
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:26,083
we need manpower, otherwise we cannot succeed.

398
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,292
Preposterous!

399
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:31,708
Even if we gather all the races, there are only 4,000 of us.

400
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:35,167
I cannot approve an operation where lives can be lost.

401
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,958
Captain Sakaki.

402
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,792
I'll be blunt.

403
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:43,750
In order for your operation to work, how many people do you need?

404
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:48,458
Combat engineers, infantry, and special forces, so three battalions.

405
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,208
If I form two companies from each,

406
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:53,500
we're looking at about 600 people.

407
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:56,667
Out of the question.

408
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:05,125
Those who do not fight, know not how to fight evil.

409
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:09,417
Those gathered now, unified as one, shall come to know God's mercy.

410
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,167
Give praise to God. All shall lead down the devoted path.

411
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:18,833
Garbetrium guidance be with you all.

412
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:24,958
This is Colonel Elliot Leland, commander of the Earth Landing Brigade.

413
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:27,333
Everyone, continue your tasks and listen.

414
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:32,042
All 600 gathered here are the chosen elite forces

415
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:36,958
who have decided to give their lives to fight against Godzilla.

416
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,292
Everyone correctly understands

417
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:46,333
that there will be no constructive outlook if you're trapped in an old society.

418
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,958
Instead of a fake promised land,

419
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,625
we will take back our homeland,

420
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,958
and promise prosperity to the next generation.

421
00:30:55,917 --> 00:31:00,458
For the sake of humanity's future, I look forward to everyone's efforts.

422
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,208
All assembled landing ships have exited the gates.

423
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,583
Now closing the first launch gate station.

424
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:22,250
That speech sounded like you wanted to pick a fight with the Committee.

425
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:24,708
Hey, Haruo.

426
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:29,875
Didn't you also want to get the Committee members frustrated?

427
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:34,708
With the current system, those members will just dry up and die.

428
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,875
There aren't any comfortable chairs for us.

429
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,208
But if we defeat Godzilla, then the story will be different.

430
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,750
A new hero will arrive.

431
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:46,875
Our era will come.

432
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,250
A hero, huh?

433
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,875
You're just like when you were a kid.

434
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:56,792
Don't take it the wrong way. You're still on bail status.

435
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:00,250
We went through a lot just to get you back out.

436
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,167
Commander.

437
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:04,750
All landing ships have assembled in low orbit.

438
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,750
All ships, enter in sequential order.

439
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:09,667
Roger.

440
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,750
All ships, begin entry in sequential order.

441
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:18,125
Ship ten, ignite engine.

442
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,958
Deploy anti-aerodynamic drag and heat shield.

443
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,583
You look unhappy.

444
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,125
Even though your wish is being granted.

445
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:30,292
I wonder if everything will go according to plan.

446
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:34,917
It'll be okay. As long as we have the hero who will guide them.

447
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,792
Are you a Leland sympathizer?

448
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:42,125
Well, the one I put my hope in is you,

449
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:43,667
Haruo.

450
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,708
The one true path to glory can only be opened through devotion.

451
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,208
This is our, the Exif's, creed.

452
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:57,083
There are only a few Earthlings who embody that.

453
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,042
You're a rare exception.

454
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:02,667
You overestimate me.

455
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:07,250
You are the one who is worthy of fighting Godzilla.

456
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:11,250
The time will come soon enough when that can be proven.

457
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,458
Ship temperature stable.

458
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,583
Passing the stratosphere.

459
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,375
Altitude 30,000 meters.

460
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:32,250
Igniting arc jet thrusters for cruising.

461
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:46,583
Once we go under those clouds, we won't see the sun anymore, huh?

462
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:49,542
This planet has been completely changed, too.

463
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:52,667
Now entering the troposphere.

464
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:58,083
Altitude 2,000. All ships, begin navigating towards landing zone.

465
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:00,833
The visibility's terrible.

466
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,667
Switching the ship's probes to ultrasonic.

467
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,458
Begin image processing.

468
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:09,250
Company A, landing zone confirmed.

469
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,833
Obstacles detected.

470
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:15,042
As the reconnaissance drones reported, this is a thick forest.

471
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:18,875
Securing landing point now. Prepare the thermobaric bombs.

472
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:21,417
Roger. Dropping thermo-pressure warheads.

473
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,458
They're being grandiose over there.

474
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:38,667
Well, the special forces will land on impeded terrain.

475
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:40,292
What?

476
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,417
An obstacle collided with the ship's exterior.

477
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,833
No issues so far with power and steering.

478
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:48,500
An obstacle?

479
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:02,333
Lieutenant Colonel Galu-gu, Company E has also landed.

480
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:05,792
We will now set the combat engineers' traps.

481
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:06,708
Okay.

482
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:10,833
The old Tanzawa Pass, huh?

483
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,667
If it was sunny, it would've been beautiful.

484
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:19,292
With this heavy fog, a visual battle would be impossible.

485
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:23,875
Lieutenant Colonel Galu-gu, please look.

486
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:24,875
This is...

487
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:27,708
Doesn't it look like something scratched it?

488
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:31,208
I hope the others are okay out there.

489
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:34,792
Get the transmission balloons!

490
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,583
You don't need to unload the medical supplies.

491
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,875
Transmission balloon reception favorable.

492
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:54,250
Companies B and C special force units will reach their destination on schedule.

493
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:59,750
Companies D and E will deploy artillery as the combat engineers lay down traps.

494
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:03,583
Okay, the first battle formation is going according to plan.

495
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:08,542
Whichever company finds Godzilla first, open fire with the special forces.

496
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,542
Provoke it and divert its course.

497
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:16,208
What's important is to observe Godzilla's electromagnetic waves when it's attacked.

498
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:21,667
We'll analyze this data to see which organ emits the electromagnetic wave.

499
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,333
Once we destroy that, we can neutralize the asymmetrically permeable shield.

500
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:31,167
And finally, we'll chase Godzilla into this Tanzawa Pass,

501
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:34,208
and slow it with traps set by the engineers.

502
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,667
The artillery unit will then open fire from a close range.

503
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:43,042
We'll amplify the pulse noise, attack all at once, and destroy the organ.

504
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:49,000
The shield will go down for a few seconds, and then we'll use EMP probes to end it.

505
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:54,167
If we can't find the amplifying organ, we can't place the infantry.

506
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:55,458
Exactly.

507
00:36:56,208 --> 00:37:00,417
The special forces analysis of the pattern will influence the plan.

508
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:05,500
So they'll spread out into a wide area, and advance while analyzing the enemy.

509
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:07,292
Cooperation is key.

510
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:13,167
But who knew we'd have to rely on something this pathetic to communicate?

511
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:17,125
If we can transmit through this convection cloud,

512
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:21,458
the drones in the stratosphere will relay our communication with no issues.

513
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,500
But in this fog, electronic communication will be limited.

514
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:28,833
What is going on with this planet's atmosphere?

515
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,583
That's what we're trying to find out.

516
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,208
Colonel, I'd like to form an investigation team.

517
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:38,125
If I can borrow three teams, as planned.

518
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:41,875
The scouting team takes priority. I'll give you two teams.

519
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:43,583
All right, then.

520
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:48,458
I'd like to go, too. I want to see with my own eyes how this terrain has changed.

521
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:49,708
You heard him.

522
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:52,667
- Master Sergeant Yuko Tani, you're up. - Yuko?

523
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,167
You'll be his handler. As you know, he's been released on bail.

524
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,500
So be careful handling him.

525
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:04,708
Understood.

526
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:28,875
Unbelievable. Are these really the plants growing on Earth?

527
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:32,667
Is this what I saw in the ship's records? Trees, was it?

528
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:34,583
They look different, though.

529
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,208
Don't touch it!

530
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,583
In some places they're sharp as razors.

531
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,458
It'd be deadly if your airtight suit got a hole in it.

532
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,250
Why did you request to join this mission?

533
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:27,375
Because you're involved, Captain Sakaki, and set up the operation.

534
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:30,917
Please don't call me that. Just Haruo is fine.

535
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:37,458
I've always wanted to meet you so we could speak in person.

536
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:43,958
I wondered if it's because of you, Cap... Haruo, that grandpa died at Tau-e.

537
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,083
I...

538
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:48,417
The bombs that you brought inside the shuttle,

539
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:53,167
I heard from security that they were definitely all removed.

540
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,917
But then the emigration group...

541
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,875
Do you think it was an accident?

542
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,083
You don't think it was?

543
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:07,833
You said the Central Committee wanted to reduce passengers.

544
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:12,292
They could have used some trick so the emigration group wouldn't...

545
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,708
The Central Committee isn't that corrupt!

546
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,125
That's what I want to think. I don't want to be suspicious of my comrades.

547
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:21,625
Haruo.

548
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:28,167
No, that's not it. I couldn't forgive myself for wanting to be suspicious.

549
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:31,167
I don't want to be so judgmental of humans.

550
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:36,167
But being on that claustrophobic ship and living on minimal supplies,

551
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:39,000
it's normal for people to become mistrustful.

552
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:44,542
Godzilla didn't just steal Earth away from us.

553
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:49,000
Justice, faith, and the basic pride we have as humans...

554
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,875
we've come to lose them, too.

555
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:57,167
And that's why we need to fight Godzilla again.

556
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,167
So we can take back the dignity we lost.

557
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:08,875
This is...

558
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,875
Professor! Please come!

559
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:13,458
Over there!

560
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,417
Ruins?

561
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:25,417
But they couldn't have lasted 10,000 years.

562
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:28,000
Captain Sakaki!

563
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,833
I see.

564
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:40,667
The lichen used the building's surface as a seedbed and became fossilized.

565
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,875
Afterwards, the building materials weathered away,

566
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:47,333
but the fossilized fungus must have retained the shape.

567
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:53,042
This is Earth's civilization. People used to live here?

568
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:57,458
Haruo?

569
00:41:58,833 --> 00:41:59,792
It remembered.

570
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:08,250
Although we've forgotten, this planet has always remembered us.

571
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:16,125
Of course. Even after undergoing change, this is still our Mother Earth.

572
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,958
The planet that belongs to humans.

573
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:22,792
We'll take it back... no matter what.

574
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,500
With our own hands.

575
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:36,125
Where's the scouting team? Haven't they responded yet?

576
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,500
It's probably the electromagnetic waves.

577
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:40,708
The reception area is five kilometers, right?

578
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:41,625
Yes.

579
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:44,375
Unexpected atmospheric changes are also possible.

580
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:47,417
There are reports of geomagnetic storms.

581
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:51,083
But we're connected with Martin's investigation team. It's strange!

582
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Hey, what's that?

583
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:03,458
Is it the scouting team?

584
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:32,417
What?

585
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:34,792
Damn it! Kill it!

586
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,208
- What? - Something happened at the camp!

587
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:45,458
- Professor Martin! - Let's go back, now!

588
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:09,750
This doesn't correspond to any of Earth's primary species records.

589
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,667
It must be a sudden variant,

590
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:17,000
otherwise, how could something evolve into a form like this?

591
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,542
Would living organisms go through such a change,

592
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:23,083
even if 10,000 years have passed?

593
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:26,083
We collected and analyzed the forest's plants,

594
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:30,458
and by using carbon dating, I know how much time has passed.

595
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:35,375
And it looks to be within a 50-year range of 19,200 years.

596
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:38,500
So our time away keeps increasing.

597
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,958
The special cell characteristics of this beast and the plants are interesting.

598
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:46,917
Okay, it came off.

599
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:54,083
The flora and fauna have differences, but also similar, wide-ranging traits.

600
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:57,625
Along with characteristics very similar to metal,

601
00:44:57,708 --> 00:45:00,458
they have bodily functions that exert powerful magnetism.

602
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,125
The same as Godzilla?

603
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:07,625
Yes. This beast is small, but it may be in the same family as Godzilla.

604
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:12,917
What's surprising is that the plants also have strikingly similar characteristics.

605
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,917
So this fog causing the electromagnetic disturbance...

606
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:20,500
The particles in the air are the pollen of this forest's plants.

607
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:23,417
It could also be their natural chaff.

608
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:27,000
If the fog's caused by the organisms and not the weather,

609
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:31,333
we have to burn the entire forest down to disperse this fog?

610
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:35,875
So, we have no choice but to abandon our first plan of waiting

611
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:39,250
for the weather to clear up a bit before we attack.

612
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:40,542
That's not all.

613
00:45:40,792 --> 00:45:43,250
If dangerous beasts are wandering around,

614
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:45,958
I have to split up our troops for camp defense.

615
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:49,333
We can reassign groups to join the special forces.

616
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:50,542
Don't be ridiculous!

617
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:55,042
You want everyone to wander in this unknown environment without a plan?

618
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:56,542
Then what's your plan?

619
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,208
Retreat.

620
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:01,708
Logically, that's our only choice.

621
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,083
What are you saying?

622
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:07,458
The water and plants are toxic, and the wild animals are hostile.

623
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:10,708
The only benefits here are air pressure and gravity.

624
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:15,625
It'd be the height of stupidity to fight Godzilla to reclaim this planet.

625
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:20,042
This is our home!

626
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:24,042
You're giving up? Not only once, but twice?

627
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:29,917
We can settle on the surface of the moon, and collect resources from Earth.

628
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:33,833
If we're thinking about safety, it's a more realistic plan.

629
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:38,375
Weren't you going to defeat Godzilla and become a hero?

630
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:43,167
I underestimated the situation. My eyes are open now and I've learned!

631
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,542
You're going to be a coward now?

632
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:50,833
From wild beasts alone, we have 12 dead and 35 critically injured!

633
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:53,750
Without even seeing Godzilla, this is the outcome!

634
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:58,208
We can't play war with new soldiers who've never fought in actual combat.

635
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:00,542
Retreat?

636
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,417
I do agree with the commander's decision, but the problem is, how do we retreat?

637
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,708
That attack just now

638
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:12,792
left us with heavier equipment loss than human casualties.

639
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,833
Is that so?

640
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:19,917
Frustratingly, those lizard things destroyed four landing ships.

641
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:25,667
Ship one and two's fuel systems and ship three and four's engines are dead.

642
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:29,542
We can't return to the mother ship orbiting this planet anymore.

643
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:33,625
If that's the case, we need to gather Company A,

644
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:39,042
and join the company with enough transit power to get us all back to space.

645
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:43,875
Companies B and C are special forces like us, so they can't do it.

646
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:48,125
So we must join the artillery unit and the trap materials unit,

647
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:50,667
which are Companies D and E.

648
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:56,625
In order for us to escape the wild animals' habitat,

649
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,375
we must move through this old Tanzawa Pass.

650
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:06,167
And our first plan was to go through the projected encounter area for Godzilla.

651
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,375
That's correct.

652
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,500
We need to pass the area where Godzilla appears frequently.

653
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:20,875
Of course, if we run into Godzilla, that would be extremely awful for us.

654
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:23,292
In order to secure safe passage...

655
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:27,542
We would need backup from Companies B and C.

656
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:33,250
However, if we join up and form a cluster, we'll be open to an atomic breath attack.

657
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:35,750
What's the safest plan?

658
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,375
While remaining spread out,

659
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:43,667
repeatedly reciprocate the threat and keep securing each other's safety.

660
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:48,750
Yes. This is, however, quite close to Captain Sakaki's original plan,

661
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:51,875
with very few changes.

662
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:58,875
Listen here. This is a retreat tactic, no matter what.

663
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:02,208
We will not take any action to lure out Godzilla.

664
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:07,583
Once all units reach the gathering point, we complete the mission,

665
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:09,542
and return to the mother ship.

666
00:49:10,792 --> 00:49:12,375
Be careful of that crack.

667
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,792
Okay, that's good. This way!

668
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:19,708
There's no fuse, but it could still explode, so be careful.

669
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,708
- That's a high explosive. Be careful. - Yeah.

670
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:27,292
Company B, C, and all landing ships, heading to Company D camp.

671
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:29,708
- Confirm landing zone. - Landing zone confirmed.

672
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:32,250
All ships rotate bearing to 202.5 degrees.

673
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,583
- Marker lock. - Roger.

674
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:36,083
So what's the situation?

675
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:38,375
Company B, Company C reserves,

676
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:43,375
and Company A hover squads are to join with Company D and stand by.

677
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:47,417
What's going on? Is the plan a go, or no?

678
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:51,042
Based on Commander Leland's orders to the hover squads,

679
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:53,542
special forces will abandon the base camps.

680
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:57,375
After all units reach the final gathering point, we'll retreat.

681
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:02,042
We'll follow our original path, but we won't search for Godzilla.

682
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:08,125
So, what? Did we come down to Earth just to display our marching orders?

683
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,500
Company A's damage must have been that severe.

684
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:15,125
I heard there were smaller Godzilla-like creatures.

685
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:18,208
They were strong enough to destroy a power suit.

686
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:22,375
Leland, that coward. If he's going to go along with Haruo's madness,

687
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:25,208
he has to resign himself from the beginning.

688
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,792
They had us design this,

689
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,542
and now we have to abandon it because of overcapacity?

690
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:40,792
Approaching Godzilla's projected contact area.

691
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:44,167
Hurry! We need to get through this area quickly!

692
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:51,167
Can't this thing pump out any more speed?

693
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:54,500
By shifting parts around, we got ship two moving.

694
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:57,500
It's all we can do to keep it hovering.

695
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:00,292
I guess I'm thankful that it's moving.

696
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:03,583
I wouldn't want to walk through this forest at all.

697
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:06,375
Are you having foreboding thoughts?

698
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:11,750
If this ends without us encountering Godzilla, then why did I come here?

699
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:15,083
Were you hoping to depend on luck?

700
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:17,833
It's fine if we're actively searching,

701
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:22,167
but if we pass by in a rush, then we won't even find anything.

702
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:27,417
That's if we were actively searching for Godzilla, right?

703
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:30,000
You and Colonel Leland

704
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:33,917
still don't understand one crucial aspect of that thing.

705
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,542
It will never let humanity escape.

706
00:51:37,667 --> 00:51:41,542
Even more so if we've come to provoke it without a trace of fear.

707
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:44,167
So, it will be searching for us?

708
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,958
Is that some divine message from god?

709
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:50,458
It's a legend.

710
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:55,542
We Exif have been wandering through space as vagrants

711
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:57,458
far longer than Earthlings have,

712
00:51:57,542 --> 00:52:00,417
and we've witnessed many civilizations destroyed.

713
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:07,333
Many have been regretfully destroyed by creatures similar to Godzilla.

714
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:08,625
What's that?

715
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:12,667
He is the punishing iron hammer for the arrogant.

716
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:16,917
For the species who pronounce themselves as lords of creation,

717
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:19,542
a divine avenger will pay them a visit.

718
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:21,250
And so, he will...

719
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:25,750
What was that?

720
00:52:26,667 --> 00:52:27,583
An earthquake?

721
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:39,667
Sound wave analysis! All units, prepare for battle!

722
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:46,042
Movement detected at two o'clock! It's approaching!

723
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:56,833
Evade! Evade, now!

724
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:07,625
We can't evade in time!

725
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:24,833
Run, Haruo.

726
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:28,125
Do as your soul cries out to do.

727
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:29,708
Yeah.

728
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,500
The propellant is leaking! It's going to explode!

729
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,833
Hurry!

730
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:32,375
I'll get you for this!

731
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:36,292
That idiot.

732
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:38,375
Haruo, why?

733
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:42,792
He's going to record the moment Godzilla activates its shield.

734
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:45,750
And to do that, you have to attack it.

735
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:54,250
Damn it, the electromagnetic sensor isn't responding. Why?

736
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:58,500
What are you doing? Let's go!

737
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:00,417
But then, Captain Sakaki...

738
00:55:02,417 --> 00:55:03,708
Then, get out.

739
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:07,625
Again! This time, at a closer distance!

740
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:12,167
Damn it!

741
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:13,167
I see.

742
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:16,958
Such light damage won't cause the shield to activate.

743
00:55:17,292 --> 00:55:18,333
Professor Martin!

744
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:22,083
Please record this next attack with the sensor.

745
00:55:22,417 --> 00:55:24,208
Captain! What's your plan?

746
00:55:24,292 --> 00:55:27,417
I'm going to nose-dive and slam into it.

747
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:28,792
What?

748
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:38,000
You bastard, I will...

749
00:55:49,792 --> 00:55:50,833
What?

750
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:11,125
This planet can go to hell.

751
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:24,208
Leland.

752
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,000
Colonel Leland was killed?

753
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:56,250
Yes. According to rank, the command will now fall to me, though...

754
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:57,583
Can you do it?

755
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:02,792
I'll need to reassign a subordinate who has disobeyed military regulations.

756
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:05,375
This is an emergency, so please understand.

757
00:57:06,042 --> 00:57:09,750
For this occasion, fine. Bring back as many people as you can.

758
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:11,208
Understood.

759
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:17,375
Did you analyze the data sent to us?

760
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:18,583
Finished just now.

761
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:21,833
The electromagnetic metamaterial's output has been recorded.

762
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:25,000
Just as you surmised, a shield exists.

763
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,958
The noise in question was confirmed.

764
00:57:28,542 --> 00:57:30,500
It's not unified across its body.

765
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:32,667
There's clearly a concentrated spot.

766
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,667
The dorsal fin?

767
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:38,792
This is where the shield is generated. Leland gave his life for this information.

768
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:46,417
Everyone, during that earlier encounter, Colonel Leland died an honorable death.

769
00:57:47,542 --> 00:57:51,208
And so, as the Central Committee's direct priest,

770
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:54,458
I have accepted full responsibility for this operation.

771
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:59,750
However, I cannot say that I am the best man for this job.

772
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:05,667
All people are born to accomplish the task they were meant to do.

773
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,458
This has been established in our scriptures,

774
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:14,625
and as I shoulder the burden of a priest, I cannot turn my back to this truth.

775
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:19,583
With the premise of taking full responsibility,

776
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:22,750
I will now entrust all decision-making...

777
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:27,167
to Captain Sakaki, as the commander.

778
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:30,958
Okay, Haruo.

779
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:32,875
Your orders.

780
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:34,250
But that's insane!

781
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:49,750
The situation is dire, so I'll skip the pleasantries.

782
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:54,625
I don't have an outlook for humanity's future,

783
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:59,875
and I don't have enough of a strategy to estimate our chances of winning.

784
00:59:00,792 --> 00:59:02,792
However, I can say this.

785
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:08,208
Those who didn't yield to Godzilla can proudly welcome another day.

786
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:12,375
This is not only a battle to kill Godzilla.

787
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:16,917
What we are about to fight is a humiliating future

788
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:20,667
with no choice but to accept despair and resignation.

789
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:28,542
If we can reject and fight that, we can once again dream of hope and pride.

790
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,833
Just as our ancestors did, who thrived here before us.

791
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:37,167
That's right. If we don't retreat now, if we don't show fear,

792
00:59:37,417 --> 00:59:41,000
and if we put our lives on the line, we've already won.

793
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:43,625
All we need to do is finish it.

794
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:48,875
Humanity's 22-year-long nightmare, and Godzilla's 20,000-year era.

795
00:59:51,792 --> 00:59:55,083
I look forward to your brave efforts. That is all.

796
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:08,375
We'll begin our operation.

797
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:11,083
Yuko, you know Godzilla's position, right?

798
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:14,375
Yes. It's about 80 kilometers north-north-east.

799
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:17,083
Moving southwest at 40 kilometers an hour.

800
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:20,875
Set up transmission balloons every 3,000 meters on the battlefield.

801
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:23,792
- We need optimal communicative reception. - Roger.

802
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:27,875
Major Belu-be, provoke Godzilla from a distance and watch its reaction.

803
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,542
Maintain that distance.

804
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,125
Sure, leave it to me.

805
01:00:31,542 --> 01:00:33,458
Adam, watch for the atomic breath.

806
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:35,875
If electric potential rises, escape immediately.

807
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,833
Understood.

808
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:38,208
Galu-gu.

809
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:42,292
I'll move to the trap point and command the power suit team directly.

810
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:43,375
What?

811
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:47,833
I'll determine the EMP probes' target point on-site.

812
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:49,458
However...

813
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:52,083
Galu-gu, how are the trap placements?

814
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:53,792
All according to plan.

815
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:56,333
Its weak point is the dorsal fin, its back.

816
01:00:56,458 --> 01:00:59,708
Since we need to concentrate our fire at a close distance,

817
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:04,833
we have to let it pass the line of fire, and lure it deeper into the valley.

818
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,208
So we only have one chance.

819
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:11,667
To make this plan work, we need to place the traps deeper in the valley.

820
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,417
Artillery units are all in position.

821
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:25,625
We're ready.

822
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,750
Can we really lure it all the way out here?

823
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:31,625
We have no choice but to believe in them.

824
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:38,333
Power suit team, move to the trap point. We'll stand by.

825
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:42,833
I'm leaving the diversion to you, Belu-be.

826
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:44,208
Roger.

827
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:50,250
All squads, ascend to planned altitude. Cross-delta pattern formation.

828
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:04,000
Godzilla detected at the projected contact area.

829
01:02:04,792 --> 01:02:07,208
All units, commence the diversion plan.

830
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:09,083
Right wing, squad one, attack!

831
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:13,917
Godzilla sighting confirmed!

832
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:14,958
Fire!

833
01:02:17,917 --> 01:02:18,875
All units, turn!

834
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:32,250
Ascend in battle formation. We'll attack as long as possible!

835
01:02:40,792 --> 01:02:42,583
Target successfully diverted.

836
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,167
We can do this!

837
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,083
Evade!

838
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:57,000
Damn it! Adam! Take the left wing!

839
01:02:57,167 --> 01:02:58,792
Roger, left wing, squad one.

840
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,833
- The impact area is bigger! - It's hard to evade!

841
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:05,333
The evading maneuvers are just a second delayed. Let's go!

842
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:17,917
- Right wing, squad two, follow and attack! - Roger!

843
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:33,083
These guys aren't part of the plan!

844
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:34,458
What's wrong?

845
01:03:34,542 --> 01:03:36,917
Major Belu-be! It's what attacked Company A!

846
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:41,208
What? All squads provide cover fire from a higher altitude.

847
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:44,542
Shoot them down before more come from the forest!

848
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,792
Left wing, squad two, counterattack!

849
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:05,625
We have no time for the small fish.

850
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:08,625
Left wing, squad two, continue the diversion!

851
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:21,250
Belu-be, are you okay?

852
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,292
It seems like you're in trouble.

853
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:27,625
Like the simulations predicted, we should be able to lure it to the spot.

854
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:29,167
But we need more firepower.

855
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:32,125
It'll be night soon. Can you hasten the process?

856
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:35,625
Ten have gone down. Ammo and gas are almost depleted.

857
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:37,375
Adam. Do you copy?

858
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:40,042
Yes. Captain, I copy.

859
01:04:40,542 --> 01:04:42,958
- I'm reassigning you. - What, right now?

860
01:04:43,042 --> 01:04:46,000
I'm shortening the time allotted to lure Godzilla.

861
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:48,208
What? How can we do that?

862
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:52,458
I'll use the landing ships for a bombardment to create a path.

863
01:04:52,542 --> 01:04:55,125
What? Send the landing ships to the frontline?

864
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,375
It's too dangerous.

865
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,917
If they get shot down, how will we return to the mother ship?

866
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:01,917
But we're already home.

867
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:06,792
There's nowhere else to return to but here. Isn't that right?

868
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:09,167
Have you lost your mind?

869
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,375
Let's do it.

870
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:13,542
It'll be useless to prepare an escape route.

871
01:05:14,042 --> 01:05:16,792
In order to win, we need to play every hand.

872
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:20,833
This is why belligerent species are difficult to deal with.

873
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:25,875
Adam, select five elite pilots. Prepare the landing ships for takeoff.

874
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:27,125
Roger.

875
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:30,792
Major Belu-be, Second Lieutenant Adam Bindewald, withdrawing!

876
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,958
Hurry and go! We'll handle this somehow!

877
01:05:34,917 --> 01:05:37,042
Right wing, squad one, charge again!

878
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:41,917
Don't fall behind!

879
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,583
Six elite pilots, standing by!

880
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:58,333
We can go anytime!

881
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:00,667
Load all ammunition, even the reserves.

882
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,167
If we mess up, that's it.

883
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,292
Roger!

884
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:05,375
All landing ships, depart!

885
01:06:06,042 --> 01:06:10,083
Starting from Godzilla's position, create a path until the signal is given.

886
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:12,667
Fire at will, if you must.

887
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:15,250
Eliminate any obstacles in its way.

888
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:18,292
Commencing final diversion.

889
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:22,083
This is the point of no return. We'll end this, now.

890
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:27,375
Listen up, the landing ships' mobility can't evade an attack in time.

891
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:30,167
Once you know you're targeted, abandon ship!

892
01:06:30,458 --> 01:06:32,250
Captain, you're being lavish!

893
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:36,708
Hover squads, save ammo until the route is open. Minimize losses.

894
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:40,833
Roger. We're almost out of gas. So there's no second chances!

895
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:43,792
Turn!

896
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:53,583
The landing ships are almost here!

897
01:06:53,667 --> 01:06:56,000
Spread out to avoid the bombardment!

898
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:02,333
All ships, drop the thermobaric bombs! Scatter all that you have!

899
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:15,417
All landing ships, disperse! Spread out!

900
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,875
So who drew the short straw?

901
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,250
It's me, huh?

902
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:43,125
Okay! Godzilla is on the diversion path!

903
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:47,083
Now! All hover squads, fire everything you have! This is it!

904
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:51,292
Roger! All squads, resume the diversion! Increase attack frequency!

905
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:58,542
Damn it!

906
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:02,458
It's no good! I can't speed up!

907
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:08,667
All squads! Join the left wing! Just a little more!

908
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:12,500
Diversion is in progress.

909
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:15,500
Godzilla is accelerating toward the trap point!

910
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:17,458
Haruo, please hurry and board.

911
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:18,417
Yuko!

912
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,542
Why are you here?

913
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:22,375
I've always been on the power suit team.

914
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:25,667
Do you understand? This is practically a suicide mission!

915
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,792
I want to become stronger!

916
01:08:29,167 --> 01:08:31,958
That's what I thought when Grandpa died.

917
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:36,792
Godzilla entering Tanzawa Pass. Only 500 meters to the trap point.

918
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:52,792
Damn it, I'm running out of gas!

919
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,958
Keep provoking it and lure it to the last point.

920
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,292
Stay calm, this is the critical moment.

921
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:01,708
Trap point arrival, 100 meters!

922
01:09:05,417 --> 01:09:08,667
You will return Earth to humans.

923
01:09:09,542 --> 01:09:10,958
Fifty more meters!

924
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:14,125
Damn, I can't stand this.

925
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:18,792
At times like this, I'm jealous of those who have a god to pray to.

926
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:27,500
All units, disperse!

927
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:30,625
Ten meters!

928
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,792
Godzilla is at the trap point!

929
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:37,792
Set off the trap!

930
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:48,625
Trap detonation complete!

931
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:55,792
Godzilla's movement stopped.

932
01:09:56,917 --> 01:09:58,792
Did we succeed in capturing it?

933
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:08,958
Artillery unit, begin concentrated fire!

934
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,333
Asymmetrically permeable shield, generated!

935
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,417
All gun ports, synchronized attack!

936
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,625
Body surface electromagnetic pulse alignment sync at 75%!

937
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:30,833
At 75%? Is the pattern changing?

938
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:34,708
Alignment incomplete. Unable to predict shield collapse!

939
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,583
Damn it, we can't attack like this.

940
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:39,625
Search for the noise. Hurry!

941
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:43,875
Noise detected. The next shield collapse is in 20 seconds.

942
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:45,333
Twenty seconds?

943
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,125
Will the restraints hold?

944
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,167
Sync at 100%.

945
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:59,542
Detecting resonance with noise wave! Shield collapse in ten seconds!

946
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:08,875
Artillery unit, fire!

947
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:14,292
If we can destroy the dorsal fin...

948
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,708
The shield is dropping!

949
01:11:18,292 --> 01:11:20,458
Electric potential rising! It's an atomic breath!

950
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:24,083
It can still attack?

951
01:11:25,792 --> 01:11:28,625
The tissue on Godzilla's back is regenerating!

952
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:30,875
The shield will be restored.

953
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:33,667
Shield will be up in about 200 seconds!

954
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:36,208
The restraints are no longer holding!

955
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:37,917
Damn it.

956
01:11:38,667 --> 01:11:39,667
I'll finish this!

957
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:42,458
Haruo!

958
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:51,125
- What is he... - With a close-range EMP attack,

959
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:53,250
he'll disrupt the noise pattern.

960
01:11:57,583 --> 01:12:00,167
The pulse is changing. It's syncing again!

961
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:03,333
The next shield collapse is in ten seconds!

962
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,792
Don't worry about me! Destroy the rest of the dorsal fin!

963
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:08,208
But then you'll...

964
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,500
Doesn't matter! Fire!

965
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:13,125
The shield is now collapsing!

966
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:18,208
Fire! Fire until the gun barrel burns up!

967
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:24,250
The shield is dropping!

968
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,417
Okay, power suit unit, attack!

969
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:43,375
The EMP probes are entering its body!

970
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:52,708
All units, retreat! Retreat!

971
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,958
Electromagnetic concentration in the air, rising!

972
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:09,292
It didn't work?

973
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:13,417
It did, the electromagnetic waves are running wild inside it.

974
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:25,833
You bastard, I have...

975
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:30,750
killed you!

976
01:13:46,667 --> 01:13:48,958
He really did it.

977
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:48,917
Haruo!

978
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:05,000
Look at this.

979
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:09,208
This body structure...

980
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:13,333
Yeah. Indeed a monster.

981
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,542
You've accomplished it, Captain.

982
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:21,250
Because everyone believed in and supported me,

983
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,750
I could be so daring and get this far.

984
01:15:24,917 --> 01:15:29,792
Even though we defeated it... What was it, really?

985
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:33,042
How was it able to live for 20,000 years?

986
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:36,042
This is just my opinion,

987
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:41,208
but I think this is a different Godzilla than the one that drove us from Earth.

988
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:46,625
But its appearance and abilities were almost identical.

989
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:50,375
And that's exactly why. Life's true nature is found in change.

990
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:54,083
No matter how gradual the renewal cycle may be,

991
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:57,792
it's impossible to maintain the exact same appearance.

992
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:02,750
So this one may be an offspring that inherited Godzilla's form and nature.

993
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,875
Such a guess would actually be the most natural.

994
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:11,167
Although the question remains of why there was only this one. Also...

995
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:15,375
So, there's no guarantee only one of them survived.

996
01:16:15,833 --> 01:16:19,833
I apologize if what I'm saying spoils the victory, but that is correct.

997
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:25,792
That's fine. Thanks to this battle, we proved that we can defeat Godzilla.

998
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:29,708
Even if another one shows up, we have nothing to fear.

999
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:35,208
Since we've established a valid strategy, we can be more effective next time.

1000
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:40,083
Personally, I would never want to cross a tightrope like that ever again, though.

1001
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,083
What was that?

1002
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:47,125
Did anyone measure the vibration?

1003
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:49,167
I'm picking it up on this sensor!

1004
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:53,042
Find the origin using Gematoria analysis.

1005
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:53,958
Yes, sir.

1006
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:58,500
No, it can't be. Is the meter damaged?

1007
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,458
- What is it? - It's within two kilometers?

1008
01:17:01,542 --> 01:17:02,583
It's nearby!

1009
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:03,833
That's ridiculous!

1010
01:17:03,917 --> 01:17:06,875
Electric potential, rising. The numbers are unbelievable!

1011
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:09,125
They are far greater than Godzilla's!

1012
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,750
Underground heat source...

1013
01:17:10,958 --> 01:17:14,042
Wait, a plasma reaction? This can't be!

1014
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:48,375
What's happening?

1015
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:03,792
Is that...

1016
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:10,708
Wh-What is that?

1017
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,083
Godzilla?

1018
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:14,833
Height over 300 meters and rising.

1019
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,375
Surface vibroscope estimates a mass of about 100,000 tons.

1020
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:23,958
This is impossible!

1021
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:43,750
Can that be a living creature? Unbelievable!

1022
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:48,417
No, according to the rules for living creatures, this is correct.

1023
01:18:49,042 --> 01:18:49,875
Professor?

1024
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:54,958
Indeed, the changing form of life isn't just about decay.

1025
01:18:55,917 --> 01:19:02,000
If it continued its life activity for 20,000 years, growing earnestly...

1026
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:06,042
When those fleeting lives destined to die,

1027
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:09,042
forget their humbleness and sing praises of their glory,

1028
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:12,625
such will shake the very heavens and split the earth,

1029
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:15,167
and they shall know the wrath of the divine.

1030
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,833
The inevitable incarnation of destruction.

1031
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:23,042
So, you show yourself at last.

1032
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:28,250
Since we last saw each other, it has been 20 years for us and 20,000 years for you.

1033
01:19:30,542 --> 01:19:31,958
It's been a while...

1034
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:34,667
Oh, King of Destruction.

1035
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:46,750
All landing ships, take off immediately! Emergency retreat!

1036
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:48,792
But we're still withdrawing!

1037
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:52,625
Just take whoever's already onboard before that thing attacks us!

1038
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,667
Everyone, do whatever it takes to get far away from here! Hurry!

1039
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,042
What's that? A super oscillatory wave?

1040
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:45,375
Estimated electric output is measuring over 900 gigawatts.

1041
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:46,583
Damn it!

1042
01:20:47,208 --> 01:20:48,667
What do you intend to do?

1043
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,042
I'll divert its attention!

1044
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:53,292
I'll buy time so people can run!

1045
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:55,583
You don't think that'll work, do you?

1046
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:10,833
You bastard... I will...

1047
01:22:11,534 --> 01:22:16,534
