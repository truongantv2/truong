00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:50,415
Violation 2-712, Rick Dicker interrogating agent.

3
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,419
Please specify your name.

4
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,489
Uh... Tony.

5
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,424
Tony Rydinger.

6
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,393
Tell me about what happened.

7
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,489
Well there is this girl in my class.

8
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,397
I saw it on the track running.

9
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,368
You, Violet is not it?

10
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,334
That's me.

11
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,327
I know little about him, but he changed.

12
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,500
He was more relaxed, confident, cool, sweet.

13
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,339
I asked her to go to the cinema.

14
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,311
- So, Friday? Friday. - Friday.

15
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,371
And I went from there.

16
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:26,317
Not long after that, this incident occurred in the parking lot.

17
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,461
Meet the Underminer.

18
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:46,495
I was always under but nothing is beneath me.

19
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:50,306
And the situation is very strange and when I saw these boots.

20
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,436
- You two stay here. - Are we really going to do this?

21
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,468
It is still illegal, right?

22
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,504
They look like a super hero.

23
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,415
- They're going to lose him? - Oh okay.

24
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,283
One of you berjagalah on the perimeter, secure the people from here.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
You have to keep Jack-jack.

26
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,413
- I think we are in this together. - You heard your mother.

27
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,323
Create a trampoline.

28
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,354
I guard the perimeter.

29
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,356
You can not go anywhere. Come back here!

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,300
I saw a chance to get out of there.

31
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,499
But I know the sound of one of the children.

32
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:24,272
The girl's voice. He was angry and threw his mask. And that's it!

33
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,278
Oh, Tony!

34
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,281
Hi. It's not what you think.

35
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,513
This is too weird I can not handle it, I fled.

36
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,349
I feel bad about it.

37
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,323
Maybe I should have said '' Hi '' or something.

38
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,291
Not because he Superhero illegal.

39
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,351
And is not I do not like girls who are stronger, I'm pretty confident.

40
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,420
Virility problems.

41
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,430
What is that?

42
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,432
Did you tell this to anyone else?

43
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,435
- Your parents? - No. They do not like to know anything.

44
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,232
You know what I mean?

45
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:55,401
- I know, son. - I like this girl, Mr. Dicker should I go with him Friday night.

46
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,502
And now would be a strange situation.

47
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,480
I wish I could say sorry to him.

48
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,449
You're going to say, son.

49
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,281
You're going to say it.

50
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,294
Come on!

51
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:43,253
Let's just say you've had in the blast from below!

52
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,378
- Underminer! We meet again. - What?

53
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:16,386
Oh, come on. Now he was trapped inside.

54
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,491
Oh!

55
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,461
lncredibles!

56
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,237
Introduce Jackhammer!

57
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,467
Feel this.

58
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,478
Until found!

59
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:04,301
No no no.

60
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:12,240
Everyone, back off, okay? Retreat.

61
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:16,471
Dash, do not make me keep the baby.

62
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,353
I tried to stop him, and Underminer escape.

63
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:27,292
Does it ever make you stop ... Bob, monorailnya!

64
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,459
Frozone! Already!

65
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,432
We have to stop this thing before it destroys the town hall.

66
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,466
I'll try to keep him away from the building.

67
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,414
Hey, lady.

68
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,520
Thank you very much, young man.

69
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,299
Violet!

70
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,350
Stop!

71
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,251
All stop!

72
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,415
Alert, father.

73
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,441
Dash!

74
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,283
Violet, who's taking care of Jack-Jack?

75
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:06,314
- Dad in charge ... - Violet, take him.

76
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,426
This thing is headed to City Hall.

77
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,337
Mother needs help.

78
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:30,213
Look at this, this is our chance, follow them, follow Frozone.

79
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,486
Bob!

80
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,260
Help me with this pillar.

81
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,373
Supposedly it can stop it.

82
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,441
Children, what are you doing? Get out of here!

83
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,316
It's going to explode!

84
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,514
There is no more time!

85
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,457
We did it!

86
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,265
Do not move, super hero!

87
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,364
Oh, what we've done.

88
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:34,277
Hey, wait, Mr. Zone?

89
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,250
Sorry, I should not be here.

90
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,276
That seems to be wrong, is not it?

91
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,518
Maybe you're interested in changing the law?

92
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:50,261
Superheroes including Frozone, Mr. lncredibles, and Elasticgirl ...

93
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,322
prevent further damage in the city.

94
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,424
The Underminer still unknown.

95
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,298
We did not start this conflict.

96
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,326
And you do not end well!

97
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,362
- You stop Underminer to destroy more? - No.

98
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,274
- Did you stop him rob a bank? - No.

99
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,277
- Did you catch it? - No.

100
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,271
The bank was already insured, we have the infrastructure to overcome this problem ...

101
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:13,513
if you did not do anything this is all still going to happen.

102
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,283
You would rather we did not do anything?

103
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,281
So true.

104
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,353
You did not help.

105
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:29,392
If you want to get out of the hole, you have to put the first shovel.

106
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,339
Wow it's awful.

107
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:40,243
Dad, maybe this is not the best time to tell you this, but ...

108
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,305
Something happened today.

109
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:46,411
A child, and my mask.

110
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:06,294
Okay, Rick, a friend of Violet, Tony, see it without using a mask.

111
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,433
- There are other info? - I do not know her last name Rydinger.

112
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:13,434
Tony Rydinger. I'll check it out.

113
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,311
Bob, Helen.

114
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,283
I want to talk if you do not mind.

115
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,417
The program is stopped.

116
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,284
What?

117
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:27,315
Politicians do not understand people who do good things because it was the right move.

118
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,225
Make them nervous.

119
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:34,358
They target Superheroes many years ago, and today they need.

120
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,336
Anyway, I'm done.

121
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,329
I'm worried about two weeks at the motel was the best that I can do for you.

122
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,365
- It's not much. - You have a lot of help, Rick.

123
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,240
We will not forget it.

124
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,508
Well, an honor working with you guys, good people.

125
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,381
Thank you for everything. And good luck.

126
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,410
Yes, you too.

127
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,502
Did you wash your hands?

128
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,240
With the soap?

129
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,276
Is it dry?

130
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,543
What? Is this all the vegetables?

131
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,449
Who ordered this vegetable all?

132
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,477
I order it. It's good for you.

133
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,388
Are we going to talk about it?

134
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,483
- What? - elephant in this room.

135
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,515
What elephant?

136
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,290
I do not think so.

137
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,296
- You mean about today? - Yes.

138
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,321
What's with today?

139
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,491
We all make mistakes.

140
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,468
For example, you should keep children Jack-Jack.

141
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,235
Keeping the baby, while you do the things that are important.

142
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,297
We already talked about this.

143
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,298
You're not mature enough to decide this.

144
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,334
- We are old enough to help. - Yes!

145
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,278
Is not that what you say to us, dad?

146
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,340
Yes, well, help it can mean many things.

147
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,250
- But we have to help where there is a sense of trust. - Yes.

148
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,311
- Are you glad we help today? - I know. But...

149
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,346
- You said you were proud of us. - Well, I used to, I'm proud.

150
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,224
We want to fight criminals.

151
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,251
No, you can not.

152
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,230
You said different situation now.

153
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,357
And that is right. On the island.

154
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,300
But I do not mean that from now on ...

155
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,497
Now we do not use our strength back again.

156
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:22,406
- That's what makes me strong. - I did not say ... what?

157
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,499
Someone says.

158
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,340
Can we eat it. Dinner.

159
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,370
While still hot.

160
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,245
Are we doing something wrong?

161
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,408
- Yes. - No.

162
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,442
We did not do anything wrong.

163
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,284
Superhero illegal.

164
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,516
Whether it's fair or not, it's legal.

165
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,492
The law should be fair. That's why we teach it to our children.

166
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,495
- We follow the law. - Although the law to harass?

167
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:48,262
If it was unjust law is no law to replace it. Otherwise there will be chaos.

168
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,395
That's what happened today.

169
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,276
I thought this was cool.

170
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,277
What?

171
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:03,270
As a crime against the family.

172
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,341
That's cool.

173
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,442
But that's over.

174
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,352
But this is happening in the world.

175
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,345
We have to adapt.

176
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,323
Is the situation worse now?

177
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,225
Fine state.

178
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,388
May I have permission?

179
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,496
How long are we at the motel, father?

180
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,471
Soon, dear.

181
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,368
What we will do?

182
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,381
I do not know.

183
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,351
- Maybe Dicker will find something. - Dicker is no longer there, Bob.

184
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,411
All our thoughts become Superheroes again, it was just wishful thinking.

185
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,354
One of us had to work.

186
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,414
One of us?

187
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,482
You do not stand working in an insurance company.

188
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,259
- I can not stand cheating them. - I know it's hard for you.

189
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:55,461
- Maybe it's my turn to work in the private sector and you keep ... - No, I did it.

190
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,265
I need to do this.

191
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:03,332
- Do you know where coat and my tie? - Burned when our house burned.

192
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,240
Ya.

193
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,371
We can not depend on anyone else now, Bob.

194
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,402
There is only us.

195
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,383
We can not wait for ...

196
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,283
There were no guards manning pool.

197
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,419
Swim responsibility own risk.

198
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,293
Oh, where are you today?

199
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,321
I know you missed all the fun.

200
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,334
Do not get angry, because I do not come to your party.

201
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:33,294
I'm not as good as you, and besides I know the police will deliver you.

202
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,502
- Yes. That's the power of Bob. - Yes, yes.

203
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,443
I heard the program was discontinued.

204
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,345
How long are you in this motel?

205
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,404
2 weeks.

206
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,382
And you know the offer is still valid.

207
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:48,375
You are very good, and the five of us. We do not want to do that to your wife.

208
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,355
The door is always open.

209
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,414
You know the news is not always bad.

210
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:59,227
While you're on hold, I was approached by a man who represents a wealthy man.

211
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,323
Winston Deavor.

212
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:04,496
She wanted to talk to me and you both about the problem Superhero.

213
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,439
I've checked it, she was fine, wanted to recruit Dicker, he wanted to meet.

214
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,533
Oh, my goodness, the more problems Superhero?

215
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,306
We just got out of trouble.

216
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,244
We're coming.

217
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,441
Tonight, I'll go now.

218
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,473
Enjoy it, I do not want to get involved.

219
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,349
He wants us three.

220
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,480
Unfortunately, at least we hear first what was going on katakannya.

221
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,457
Do you have an address, I meet you there.

222
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,483
Superhero costumes go with us?

223
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:33,227
Yes. Wear your costume Superheroes long.

224
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,428
I sensed that he wanted.

225
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,271
You're going where?

226
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:45,243
- The air is very fresh tonight. - You know who the phone ...

227
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,304
I know what to dlakukan.

228
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,290
Security card to you.

229
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,292
Please come this way.

230
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:05,252
Sir, are you a fan I weigh, I'm a fan ... Right.

231
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,356
Shit.

232
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:32,519
I Love Superheroes!

233
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,290
I understand your struggle.

234
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,353
Winston Deavor. You can call me Wins.

235
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,299
It was very nice to meet you. Frozone!

236
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,267
- Elasticgirl. - Nice to meet you.

237
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,530
- Mr. lncredibles.- Halo.

238
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:53,342
~ Mr. lncredibles, lncredibles, catch criminals, pow pow!

239
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,314
~ Who's the cat that got you ...

240
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,375
~ When survived virtually no chance ...

241
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,478
~ Frozone, Frozone.

242
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,355
~ Frozone!

243
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,449
Ya!

244
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,393
I will tell you about what all of this, and this is ...

245
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:13,229
Oh, hello ... Superhero. I am sorry...

246
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:19,226
- It's strange sister, Evelyn. - I'm not weird, you do not need to be so, Winston.

247
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,330
Spectacular.

248
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:25,275
My father was very proud that I know you from afar.

249
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,507
He used to call you, the last defense.

250
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,277
He is a staunch supporter of you.

251
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,408
He donated on behalf of the Superhero.

252
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,420
To raise funds to build a statue in the park Dynaguy Avery.

253
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,422
He knew many Superhero personally.

254
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:44,295
Even installed a phone with a direct line to Gazerbeam and Bionic for emergencies.

255
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,423
She loved it. He showed it to everyone.

256
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,401
He was disappointed once when you are forced to go into hiding.

257
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:54,372
My father believed the world a dangerous place without you.

258
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,308
You know he's right.

259
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,469
There was theft.

260
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:05,280
My dad called Gazerbeam, direct line ...

261
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,409
No answer.

262
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,352
She called Bionic.

263
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,342
No answer.

264
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,516
Superheroes just become illegal.

265
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:17,393
The thief was seeing my dad called, and shot him.

266
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,226
So...

267
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,357
Definitely hard to ...

268
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,231
Especially for the mother.

269
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,293
He died a few months later.

270
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,293
Broken hearted.

271
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:30,274
If Superheroes are not forced to hide this will never happen.

272
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,472
Or the father could take the mother to a secure room so knew there was a robbery.

273
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:38,439
I totally disagree, but we do not do it now.

274
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:44,320
The point is no one thought we could run the company my father.

275
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,417
And Evelyn as a designer, and myself as the operator ...

276
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,486
Make us build Devtech become what it is today.

277
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:55,490
- the last communication company in the world. - Bigger than ever.

278
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:59,265
The right position to make justify the wrong thing.

279
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,239
Because it then there is this meeting.

280
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,433
Let me ask you guys something.

281
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:06,434
- What are the main causes you have to hide? - Ignorance.

282
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,345
Perception.

283
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,543
Take for example today with Underminer. A difficult situation.

284
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,314
You are faced with many difficult decisions.

285
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,411
So true.

286
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,512
I can not.

287
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,388
Because I do not see it.

288
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,291
Likewise with other people.

289
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,454
So when you guys fight bad guys like today ...

290
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,396
people do not see fights or situations memukainya ...

291
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,457
They see what is desired by politicians ...

292
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,401
They see the destruction, and they see you.

293
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:35,430
So if you want people to change their perception about you guys the Heroes Super ...

294
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,410
We need you to share you with the world's perception.

295
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,435
How do we do it?

296
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,310
With the camera.

297
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,441
You share perceptions with the world.

298
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,474
How do we do it?

299
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:50,319
We put a small camera like that into your Super Hero costume.

300
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,447
Wow. Very small.

301
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,447
- And incredible shape. - Thank you.

302
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,481
I designed it myself.

303
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:59,361
We have the resources, lobbyists, connections across the world and a very important ...

304
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,355
- Insurance. - Insurance is the key.

305
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,233
What we need now is Superhero.

306
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:09,434
That means three of you, come help me make Superhero legal again.

307
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:13,343
It sounds great, let's get started, what our first task?

308
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:21,377
Enthusiastic was nice, keep it, but it's our first step, Elasticgirl our hero.

309
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,217
Better than me?

310
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,246
Ya.

311
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:30,422
I mean, he's great, really, but you know ...

312
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,394
Do you know...

313
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,389
With all due respect, let's not rush, insurance paid for everything.

314
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,392
It's just the beginning, okay?

315
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,405
Wait, what say?

316
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,429
I'm a mess?

317
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:47,434
Evelyn analysis when you fight crime during the five years prior to hide.

318
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,505
Figures Elasticgirl can explain himself.

319
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,413
Gee was not a fair comparison.

320
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,476
All major problem, need big solutions.

321
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:58,422
Of course. We will solve all the problems together.

322
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:04,259
After a perfect launch with Elasticgirl.

323
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,528
- So, what do you think? - What do I think?

324
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:13,394
- I do not know. - What do you mean you do not know.

325
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:18,240
A few hours ago, you told us to be a super hero fantasy.

326
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,337
Now you get an offer of a lifetime and you do not know?

327
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,508
It's not that easy, Bob. I do not want troublesome children.

328
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,280
- I also. - From prison, Bob.

329
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,484
How did you do it? By rejecting the opportunity to change it.

330
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,320
Forcing them off as they are?

331
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,452
What happens with who they are? They're just kids.

332
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,327
Children with strength, which makes them super.

333
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,490
Between them they decided to use force or not.

334
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:44,299
- This is going to benefit them. - Listen, this is not a good time to go.

335
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,330
Dashiel have a problem with homework, Violet concerned with the man she loves.

336
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:52,469
- Tony. And Jack ... - Jack? What is up with her?

337
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:57,244
Well, nothing wrong with it. But normal baby needs attention.

338
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,241
- I'm not sure I can go. - Of course you can go.

339
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:06,418
You have to, so I, we ... Could stronger together again. So our children can have fun.

340
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:11,519
- So you have that option. - Well, yes. So I can have that choice.

341
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,328
And I will do a terrific job.

342
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,302
Although they say about me.

343
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,238
But they want you.

344
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:28,338
And you will be great. Actually.

345
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:34,349
That's really bad. Why can not you ...

346
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,379
That's good to want the glory, you know. But...

347
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,391
What are the options? One, Lucius right, well paid,

348
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:44,385
rather than being in the motel, and the kids better, including our children.

349
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:48,490
Or second, I'm looking for a job within two weeks and return.

350
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,334
You know it's crazy, is not it?

351
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,328
To help my family, I had to lie down on the shore, I must destroy ...

352
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,398
- You will be enormous. - I know I would.

353
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,466
But what about you? We have children.

354
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,273
I'll take care of children. No problem. Easy.

355
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:05,375
Easy, huh? You brag. If there are problems, I will cancel and go home.

356
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,411
You do not need to, I can, you just leave. Do it.

357
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:14,221
Just do it, I'll give you a bear.

358
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:20,330
- It Deavor. - It Elastigirl, I agree.

359
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:26,326
Mr. Deavor, is unusual. But you are too generous.

360
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,305
Nonsense. This is at least what we can do.

361
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,503
We are now colleagues. Can not have my partner stayed at the motel.

362
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,479
- Whose house? A house? - It's my house.

363
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:38,449
I have several. You live how long it takes.

364
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,280
I do not know what to say.

365
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,446
How to thank you?

366
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:47,290
- This is our new home? - I think so, take it easy, champ.

367
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,384
- It's ours. - Yes.

368
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,362
- Mother. - Look at this place.

369
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:55,298
Deavor buy from certain kolongmerat who like to come and go.

370
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,463
Without visible, so this house has some hidden place.

371
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:03,440
Things you will not be exposed. With one unknown.

372
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,433
This house has a spacious yard.

373
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:09,436
- This ... Is not it redundant. - Have the field.

374
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:13,474
- What do you prefer in the motel? - It's a pool.

375
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:18,518
- What exactly is the mother's new job? - Most importantly, we are out of the motel.

376
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:22,357
I love the new mother's job.

377
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:36,331
Wow, look at the water feature.

378
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:43,278
to live please.

379
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,253
- Oh no! - Stop it.

380
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,452
- Watch out! - Dad!

381
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,361
Log in to the pool. No!

382
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,468
I, nothing ...

383
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:09,399
Dark and antiques. I Elastigirl. I, you know ...

384
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,376
- Flexible. I mean ... No. - Are you designing this?

385
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,379
Of a man named Alexander Gawkin.

386
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:21,318
Glad it's you, not me, because you will have to do with this record.

387
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:25,346
- What? - Elastigirl, the vehicle is in the garage. Evelyn

388
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:33,458
- Motor new Elastic. - Elasticycle? I do not know you have a motor.

389
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,467
Hey, I got a Mohawk. There's a lot about me that you do not know.

390
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,368
Ya, Mohawk?

391
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,464
You did not miss anything.

392
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:48,244
- Oh, yes. This one electric. - What does it mean?

393
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,452
- Errors. Sorry. Should improve. - You will be enormous.

394
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:59,389
- I'll be great. And you too. - We'll both be great.

395
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,415
Goodbye My Love.

396
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:26,507
- Wait a minute, it Elastigirl? - Elastigirl.

397
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:37,427
Hei, Elastigirl.

398
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:41,457
Elastigirl tiba.

399
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:45,459
- You're right on time. - It spins five times.

400
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:53,276
Look at it. New place. You want to make the company's skyscrapers.

401
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:57,270
- You arrive in the city with the highest crime. - The strange thing, is not it? We're talking about.

402
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,409
It's like a playground superheroes.

403
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,481
Not much sugar in my custody.

404
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,228
- Where's the mother? - He's out. He was at his new job.

405
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,494
- Be a hero. - I think superheroes are still illegal.

406
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,365
They are illegal for now.

407
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,371
So mothers be paid for breaking the rules.

408
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:24,240
He did not violate ... He was in Africa for a super hero.

409
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,505
- It's a new job. - So, the mother went.

410
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:31,346
Illegally to tour why she should be illegal.

411
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:35,342
Hey Hey. Bus tiba.

412
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:39,312
Grab your things, Dash, go ...

413
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,392
Put your homework on the bag.

414
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,485
Goodbye.

415
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:56,229
We will be fine. You do not ask the tough questions

416
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,345
Well, do not worry.

417
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:05,315
- What am I? - It's weird. Many crimes.

418
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:10,378
True, you're in the middle of the worst crime area of ​​the city. It was perfect.

419
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,448
- This is a friend to play superheroes. - Friends playing superheroes, either.

420
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:17,427
No, when we were hiding. My husband always said alert.

421
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:21,364
Waiting for something to happen. And I'm angry with him for it.

422
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,503
- Uh, I almost forgot. Something happens. - The entire unit ...

423
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:30,236
I get the conversation about the disorder at the opening ceremony.

424
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,368
- Interference or a threat? - Both.

425
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,402
- Case 54. Ordered. - A threat.

426
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:39,315
Perfect. 54, after him. Come on, come on.

427
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:44,251
Vio, I want you back here at 10:30.

428
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:49,386
- Oh, after that? Okay, 10:30. - Done. 10:30.

429
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,294
Enjoy her movies.

430
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:56,266
In the ninth meeting Ark is, cutter, the ...

431
00:28:56,301 --> 00:29:00,533
Everything is given to the loser sleep. Asleep.

432
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,416
What was discussed?

433
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,250
We will control the earth.

434
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,447
We can rule the world.

435
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:25,327
That's not the way to calculate it, dad. It's a way to do it.

436
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:28,457
I do not know how it is. Why did they change the math.

437
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,491
- It's okay, dad. - That's not math, it's math.

438
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,503
I'll wait for the mother to return.

439
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:37,237
What? He will not know more than me.

440
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,368
They called Linus.

441
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:47,478
Everything used, Turbor disturbed. While asleep, simply because they can not pursue.

442
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:56,291
Quasi asleep and snoring. Eyes are very heavy.

443
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:01,392
Surviving, in essence, everyone, everyone sitting in the hay.

444
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:05,232
Everyone was asleep, which they lack.

445
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,502
The mayor usually exaggerate about their city, and I'm no exception.

446
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:13,409
And I believe, you feel it.

447
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,469
Are you confident the police would be okay with this?

448
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,471
Of course, that's the easy part.

449
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,417
They have not forgiven us have made their lives easier.

450
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,251
I know the police chief, it would not be a problem.

451
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:28,385
With all due respect. If you are alone, it would be different.

452
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,293
I'm just saying it.

453
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:35,392
And I must admit, to our incredible launch bullet train.

454
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:40,302
It will take you where you need to go, with extraordinary speed.

455
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:44,297
The future is open officially.

456
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,486
Wait, stop the car.

457
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,396
What?

458
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:11,263
The carriage drove in the wrong direction.

459
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,463
- It drove backwards. - I'm going after him.

460
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:24,475
The train was almost overtaken. 180 and still rising. How quickly created.

461
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,478
About 25 miles.

462
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,293
No one can stop this train and help.

463
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,455
It's okay. Do not go.

464
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,262
What it Elastigirl?

465
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,435
Caution!

466
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:52,275
- Reset! - They block the system.

467
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:00,507
- We will fail to save. - Not enough time.

468
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:07,256
- Someone call? Who? - Hey, mom, I could not find socks,

469
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:10,284
And he could not find his toys. We'll call you again.

470
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,286
- So, calm down. - Do not call your mother.

471
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,265
Allright darling. Can not talk right now. But check under your bed, right?

472
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,461
- How much time? - Approximately 2 minutes.

473
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:21,336
There is a shortcut, cut to the front end.

474
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,373
I do not know if I can catch him.

475
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,473
Come on!

476
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,434
What the hell?

477
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:44,279
Everything is alright? There are people injured? Are you alright?

478
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,345
Nice story better!

479
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:54,381
- Hi? Hi? - What happened?

480
00:34:54,425 --> 00:35:02,525
Welcome back, Elastigirl. Rapta-pantallas.

481
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:32,429
- Honey, why are you? - Do not say anything.

482
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,328
- It's dad. Are you alright? - I am fine.

483
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,272
- I do not want to talk about this. - You did not go?

484
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,504
- I do not want to talk about it. Father. - Oh dear.

485
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:52,380
Go away from here, not better. Leave me alone. Please.

486
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,420
That's my brother, this burger.

487
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,424
I feel you are more mature, Roy.

488
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,518
Because you're extraordinary.

489
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:11,267
Raise your hand, raise your hand. Put your hands behind your head.

490
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:15,363
You too, miss it. And come here.

491
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,241
Note the door.

492
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,437
And then I change ...

493
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,340
Now.

494
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,354
I'm telling you now.

495
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,512
Come on!

496
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:13,223
No, no, no, no, no!

497
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,420
No!

498
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,487
No, no!

499
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:26,266
No, no, no! No, no! No, no!

500
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:40,343
You have the power! Yes! Baby, no injuries to you!

501
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:44,219
I thought you did not have, you have the power.

502
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:49,453
You can multiply and penetrate any hard.

503
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,357
Oh, my God.

504
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,302
- Hello. - Hi, dear. You'll call me?

505
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:11,441
I'm fine, do not. I mean, yes, yes. I just ... weird thing just happened in the yard.

506
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:15,408
- Sounded like he woke. - No, no, it's just, Jack-Jack.

507
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:18,217
He was in an accident, I know. I'm home now. I know.

508
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,383
No, no, no. There are no accidents. Remained there, it is your mission.

509
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:24,452
And you never, should, should, what? You do not think I could do it?

510
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,521
I'm sorry, I was overcharged.

511
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:31,228
- What do you need me to go home? - No, no. No. I was able to.

512
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:34,260
- Everything is fine. - What happened to Jack-Jack.

513
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:39,333
- No, he helps all. - That's good.

514
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:46,316
- What about Violet? Tonight, right? - Oh, yes. Yes. Good.

515
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:50,309
Everything was good, good. And Jack-Jack to sleep? Without any problems?

516
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,288
Okay, no problem.

517
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,483
And Dash finish homework?

518
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:57,358
- Everything is finished. - So it was not out of control when I go?

519
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:02,230
Exceptional as it looks, it's nice. In fact.

520
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,460
How about you?

521
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,436
I think it's incredible all!

522
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:11,406
That's fantastic. The mayor stuck in the car ...

523
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:14,411
In the opening ceremony, Elastigirl save the mayor ...

524
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:21,284
Activated, bla-bla-bla ... A few words and then the train began moving backwards,

525
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,413
- Then ... - new car crash tragedy ...

526
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:28,222
For Elastigirl, almost all superheroes.

527
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,420
Elastigirl...Elastigirl...

528
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,261
There were no casualties.

529
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,391
Using a motor ...

530
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:40,368
And I pursue it, I tell dear, it was extraordinary.

531
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:44,398
That's unusual, unfortunately. On the first night of yours, dear.

532
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:49,379
- I'm so proud of you. Very. - I'm proud of you, honey.

533
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:54,316
I know you want to get out there, and you will soon, either. You will be enormous.

534
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,479
I could not do it if you do not take very good experts.

535
00:40:56,487 --> 00:41:00,321
- Thank you to handle everything. - It is nothing.

536
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,384
I love you, dear. I'll be home soon.

537
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,454
- Sweet dream. - Sweet dreams, dear.

538
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:25,272
Oh, is completed. Please, dad. It is okay.

539
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,251
I'll wait for the mother.

540
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:31,482
In secret, I know ...

541
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,423
I can do the math.

542
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,335
Oh, not good at all.

543
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:54,370
Command weak, am I too weak?

544
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,476
It's not my fault they changed the math.

545
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,288
Get up, baby.

546
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:12,262
I do not like to disturb your sleep.

547
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,426
Do you still want to continue to sleep?

548
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:20,460
You have to remember it all.

549
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,400
Calculate the formula correctly.

550
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:28,469
You understand? You're terrific.

551
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,460
Oh. Hello.

552
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:48,329
Where is your house? I wrote a message in your locker.

553
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,356
With permanent ink.

554
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,392
Oh, what's that?

555
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,338
- Did you forget? - Forget?

556
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,499
What?

557
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,311
That's funny.

558
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:07,407
Very funny. Oh, what for a strange costume?

559
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:11,252
Because there is, I'm in a hurry ...

560
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:17,319
and it was like Shakespeare, but not similar. The kids thought it was a super hero costume.

561
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,487
- Children love super heroes. - Yes.

562
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:22,295
You want to wear something, but too tight and could not.

563
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:26,531
Do I know you?

564
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,403
The topic of conversation these days is lncredibles.

565
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:39,371
Sorry, I do not really like to talk about it.

566
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,442
Maybe they did not.

567
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,419
I have not been putting on my face.

568
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,287
This is good, I train you on this momentum.

569
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,453
Get out and be yourself and answer appropriately.

570
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,291
Ms. Elastic Girl, they're ready for you.

571
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:56,232
Hey, folding legs.

572
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,370
thanks.

573
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:03,272
- Hurry. - Wait ... wow!

574
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,504
You are Elastic Girl! I'm shook hands.

575
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:09,341
Oh, I was so sad when you disappeared.

576
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:11,405
I'm glad you're back!

577
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,473
With a great costume.

578
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:16,418
- It means a lot to me. - Good luck with your speech.

579
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:21,254
- I hope you're at peace. - Of course. Opponent crime!

580
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,350
Okay.

581
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:25,260
Three, two ...

582
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:28,231
For more than 15 years, superheroes in hiding.

583
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:31,359
Forced to do so, because they lost the support.

584
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:35,395
That may soon change due to the movement to restore superheroes.

585
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:40,399
Here was present heroes who save the train and with a new look.

586
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,469
Pahlawan super, Elastic Girl.

587
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,276
- Welcome. - Hello, Jed.

588
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,339
All the attention was focused on you.

589
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:47,475
Correct. Did you know?

590
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,248
Of course.

591
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:53,280
- Hello. - What do I get perhartianmu?

592
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,415
Ya, Jed.

593
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,451
Of course, I appeared on your screen.

594
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:00,487
Read the words to say on the other screen.

595
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:05,491
Screens are everywhere and we controlled all of it.

596
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:10,405
And display control myself.

597
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,307
Human control screen.

598
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:15,311
- Hey! - I who control everything.

599
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:18,338
Angry reactions that occur in front of you.

600
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,316
- What about him? - The signals are hijacked!

601
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,409
- I'm going to close it. - Do not look at the monitor.

602
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:25,286
I just hijack the signal, they are fine.

603
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:30,420
I'm still at the top, right, Elastic Girl?

604
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,487
- Whoa! - Where is the window ...?

605
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,397
There.

606
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,335
- What happened? - That Elastic Girl!

607
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:51,371
What is he doing?

608
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:04,383
- What are you doing here? - This place is dangerous. Caution!

609
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:08,456
Follow them on!

610
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:14,461
Get away from there! I'm going to jump!

611
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,448
Stop it! That Elastic Girl.

612
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:29,215
I'm saving your town, Mom!

613
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:39,452
We are under attack! Protect minister!

614
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:46,358
- Open the door! - That's dangerous!

615
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:50,405
You all, jump!

616
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:10,258
Caution!

617
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:14,355
We're going to fall!

618
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,267
Are you okay, Mom?

619
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:26,265
I am alright...

620
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,419
Yours is not tasty cakes.

621
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:40,481
- Good morning. - You saw me in that costume ...

622
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:44,426
and pretend to know me.

623
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:47,294
I was just trying to protect you.

624
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,390
She really see you there.

625
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:56,305
That's up to you, I can not tell how many memories I have.

626
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,401
Someone knows the identity of your mother and me.

627
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,470
I see you! Did you tell them about Tony!

628
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:09,281
- Dear. - You're ruining my life!

629
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,364
I hate super hero!

630
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:27,360
And I'm not going to wear it again!

631
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,342
I'll tear it up!

632
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:44,479
What can I learn math?

633
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:48,321
It seems that yesterday's incident was terrible ... '' Elastic Girl save the minister. ''

634
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:51,294
there has been a strike yesterday to the minister.

635
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,353
What's up now? Why abounded.

636
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,331
They came to offer support.

637
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:58,199
Support? Support for what?

638
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:02,432
Support to you.

639
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,374
Come on out, we all support you!

640
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:08,276
Hello! Is.

641
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,473
Oh, thank you very much.

642
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:17,283
Hello. What is written there?

643
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,285
Oh, I see you! Ellen Wood.

644
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,355
Oh, now you're returning my calls about superheroes?

645
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:31,357
Oh, I have to call you back. My God, you're great.

646
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:32,493
Hold all the phone for me.

647
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,470
Hey! It worked!

648
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,271
Hey, ministers make great speeches about super heroes today.

649
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:40,368
You saved a lot of lives and she is very happy.

650
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:43,436
Who would expect it? I got a lot of calls.

651
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:46,348
Increased media attention 720/0

652
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:50,343
The urge to legalize the super hero into a global movement!

653
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,355
I had big plans for the next.

654
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,256
We will hold a press conference at sea.

655
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:58,421
We will use the ship and sail the sea while ...

656
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:01,329
It's true. I'm happy.

657
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:05,461
I'm happy to have saved the lives of people and the minister proud of me.

658
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,436
And I'm glad you're happy.

659
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:10,463
I heard that you were happy, but why I do not feel like it?

660
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:13,443
Because I did not catch it. He's still out there.

661
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:16,469
All I did was follow the game and win in this round.

662
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:20,381
He will want it again and when he plays, he always wins!

663
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:24,252
One thing I learned in business that is sniffing flowers.

664
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:27,256
Everything is in bloom and where would you put on a stone nisanmu?

665
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,258
- He's too worried? - OK.

666
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:33,491
Stop talking. Show him.

667
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,500
Wow.

668
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,271
Wow! Elastic Girl. You are here.

669
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,404
- Hello. - I do not know what ... wow!

00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:52,348
Come on, you can do it.

671

I bring it here, they are hiding.

681
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,257
Their strength, the secret identity, all transferred.

682
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:40,457
A pleasure to meet. I always thought the greatest.

683
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,455
Well, thank cation. You are so kind.

684
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:46,401

You know, dropping objects electricity.

688
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:57,404
Assemble and unleash the power of lightning.

689
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:02,350
I Reflux. I can be anything you decide.

690
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:05,321
I know you're very excited.

691
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,414
- Just say it. - Oh, I'm not busy.

692
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:10,393
Forget it.

693
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:17,331
Yes, it was amazing. Come back.

694
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:20,269
So...

695
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:25,238
Well, congratulations on this great day.

696
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:28,507
Good night all. See you tomorrow.

697
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,342

698
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,316
- You're wearing the pants in this time? - Of course.

699
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,376
Well, it's been a while since you did ...

700
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:39,445
and even then you are under its shadow.

701
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:41,219
Yes, I feel differently.

702
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:45,285
I did not mean it. You're very successful and you're the star.

703
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:50,391
But you have to talk about it. This is your house.

704
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,426
- You need to fix your attitude. - What are you doing?

705
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,439
- You're not better. - I do not want his work.

706
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,465
I can not do that to you.

707
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,411
I'm asking you, the rooms where the most intense?

708
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,414
You never entered, it must be clean.

709
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:06,415
Beautiful scenery?

710
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:10,510
That will affect turnover as more and more buyers.

711
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,354
Whatever you are selling nothing. Who penging what people buy?

712
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:18,259
It's true. If I find the origin of the universe.

713
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:22,527
My sister will look for ways to approach it. Perhaps with foot massage.

714
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:26,428
So, what do they say?

715
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:29,404
They will tell you to get ready.

716
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:33,342
They will wait for permission and the preceding first.

717
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,503
- Looks like it was my brother. - What?

718
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,307
You sound like my brother.

719
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:40,249
Well, he's not wrong. We're not going to get a reaction.

720
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,410
- I know how! - My older brother?

721
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,510
What? Not! The movement!

722
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,422
Send him a message and I'll try to track it.

723
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,255
How fast can you get to the airport?

724
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,251
- OK. - We should get out of this town.

725
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:54,321
I will be prepared tomorrow morning at 5.

726
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,229
Insert it into the television. Jed!

727
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:58,325
I will make my brother do a live broadcast tomorrow ...

728
00:53:58,335 --> 00:53:59,302
with a news event!

729
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,304
- We'll trap her! - He will not tell!

730
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,532
Movement of the hero will succeed!

731
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:07,272
Tonight!

732
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:10,404
- Who is this? - Yeah, hey Rick.

733
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:13,348
Do you remember the child who never told you?

734
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,317
Yes, what is up? He's a good kid.

735
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:19,254
Well, he also deals with my daughter.

736
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,315
Actually you harm my daughter.

737
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,451
Oh, shit. I did not know about that.

738
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:25,393
Rick, you have to help.

739
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,454
Violet hates me, you and superheroes.

740
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:32,458
I have to fix this. What do you know about Tony?

741
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,471
Not much. Looks like he's a good kid.

742
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:39,499
She loves music and sports. His parents happy.

743
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,477
These children work part-time.

744
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:45,504
Of Happy Platter?

745
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:51,250
Why are we the way here and eat at Happy Platter?

746
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:52,448
We would like to reserve a table is there.

747
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:58,257
Near the plant. Nice is not, close the plant.

748
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,265
This place does not look so fun.

749
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,358
The place is rather dull.

750
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,266
Boring.

751
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:09,329
I thought you wanted to change our course.

752
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:13,308
- I like the food was outstanding. - That's not good.

753
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,440
That all diet foods and all vegetables.

754
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,506
Good evening, everybody.

755
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:23,384
- What is wrong with you? - Do not you anything?

756
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,447
- Let me help you ... - He was surprised.

757
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:31,256
Normally she was never like that.

758
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,319
- Do you want water, sir? - Yes.

759
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,357
A glass of water. This is my daughter, you know him?

760
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,492
- Halo.- Violet.

761
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:41,368
Halo, Violet.

762
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,497
Hey, say hi to the ...

763
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:46,236
- Do not be too pushy, father. - How are you?

764
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:48,210
Halo.

765
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,236
This drink is delicious.

766
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:54,512
- Water What is this? - I do not know, the tap water.

767
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:59,420
- Very delicious. - Extraordinary.

768
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,288
Nice to meet you.

769
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,452
Where is he going?

770
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,452
Finding a place to go berserk?

771
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:10,488
Hi, we will conduct a special interview with Elastic Girl.

772
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,297
How are you, Jed? Do not you anything?

773
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,396
I am fine. Doctors have examined me.

774
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,497
I do not remember what happened.

775
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:21,500
I must tell you, strange to experience the event.

776
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,479
I do not remember.

777
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:27,506
I ask that everyone not to worry.

778
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,484
Where are you now?

779
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:32,249
I was in a cave that is very safe.

780
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:36,349
I want to talk to you, starting with a rescue train recording.

781
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:41,490
This is the original footage of the action beranimu.

782
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:47,231
We have to save him before the train crashed!

783
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,239
25 miles away. Guavaberry

784
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,337
I will do an important announcement at this event.

785
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:58,245
- He knows. - The mechanism worked.

786
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:01,250
- No need to look for the source. - Gotcha!

787
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:07,247
You will not be able to find it. I could not be found.

788
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:15,221
And when you are aware, I've been in a place far away.

789
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:21,397
Superheroes are creatures who must be destroyed.

790
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:28,276
They do not show their real face.

791
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:31,474
They're just pretending to be a hero,

792
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:37,442
every action they do to deceive you.

793
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:47,453
All their crimes hidden behind their masks.

794
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:51,491
As the disease in the human body.

795
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:58,430
You think they protect you, in fact you have been made weak.

796
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:02,241
I tell this so their cover blown.

797
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:07,342
And everything can be saved from their deceit.

798
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:13,379
The existing system has made a big mistake.

799
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:21,353
Destroy all of the existing system and try to stop me.

800
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:28,236
You're no longer in control. I who control everything.

801
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:11,499
I see you.

802
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,382
Sorry!

803
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:34,413
What happened?

804
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:37,517
You ruined my proof!

805
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,495
What is this? What do I do?

806
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:44,432
- You can not do this! - Right, just blame the system!

807
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:47,368
Jebakanmu succeed, you're a genius.

808
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:51,362
Oh, come on. I'm just a genius behind the genius.

809
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,239
The latest news today ...

810
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:58,270
Dad, what we will do this formula?

811
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,213
Come ask me.

812
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,375
Do not you ... Are not you tired?

813
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:08,222
Now we have to learn more.

814
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:13,320
A car driven by a super hero.

815
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:16,331
I bought it when the auction.

816
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:17,526
They said the car was destroyed.

817
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:19,501
Hey, the car in good condition.

818
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:21,436
You used to have that car?

819
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,336
They said the car was destroyed.

820
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:27,274
This famous car will be auctioned.

821
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:31,474
That is ... That's my car!

822
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,283
You're going to fill it with advanced equipment.

823
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:46,318
- Is it true? - I like this car.

824
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:50,264
But it will take a long time.

825
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:54,335
Wow! His car is on fire!

826
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:56,296
Hah?

827
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:58,466
What are you doing? It's not a toy!

828
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:00,339
That is the rocket launcher!

829
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,276
Wait, we have to launch a rocket.

830
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,471
Hey, it's not your car.

831
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,242
It's also not a car.

832
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:06,476
That's my car. That's mine.

833
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:08,347
Why is that person who has it?

834
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:10,409
- He does not have it. - Launch a rocket.

835
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:11,408
Launch rocket!

836
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,285
We're not going to launch anything.

837
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:18,350
Do you think I want them to come to me now, when I try to not ...

838
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,522
distract.

839
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:26,335
Shit.

840
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:32,435
So you're not going to steal your car back?

841
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,483
Jack-Jack has the power?

842
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,481
- Correct. - You know about this?

843
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,459
- Yes. - Why did not you tell us?

844
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,486
- I know. - We are your children. We are entitled to know.

845
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,259
- You tell mom? - No.

846
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:59,291
- Why not? - Your mother was not happy to hear it.

847
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:01,361
Why are we not going to tell her?

848
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,337
- What? - Because, it can not.

849
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:03,463
- Come on, man. - Why?

850
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,372
- Because ... - Really not cool.

851
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:07,501
Because I'm thinking about it. Okay?

852
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:10,444
I accepted the information and are currently processing it.

853
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:15,383
I tried to fix it and try to prevent the baby into a flaming monster.

854
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:17,409
How do I do that?

855
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:22,390
By accepting all the mischief, okay?

856
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:27,488
Because I'm Mr. lncredible, not Mr. Soap, or Mr. Milk.

857
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:31,455
Mr. lncredible.

858
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:34,301
Gosh.

859
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:39,365
No, I can handle it. There's no way I'm going to ...

860
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:53,352
I will contact Lucius.

861
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,224
Look normal to me. Since when did this happen?

862
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,229
Since Helen got the job.

863
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,218
I assume he knows it.

864
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,323
Are you kidding? I could not tell him about this.

865
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:05,231
Not as long as he did the work of heroes.

866
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:08,533
LBU.

867
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:13,467
I must succeed so that he could succeed.

868
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:15,409
For us to succeed.

869
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,470
I understand, Bob. I understand.

870
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,277
When was the last time you slept?

871
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:24,480
No need to be exaggerated. I can handle this.

872
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,249
So...

873
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,279
then you okay?

874
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:30,418
You can overcome this situation, is not it?

875
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,262
What ...

876
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,493
Okay, time for cake.

877
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:41,333
Delicious cake.

878
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:42,429
Cake.

879
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:46,465
- You can not ... - Cake ...

880
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:50,436
He had just ...

881
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:53,243
Coming from another dimension. Correct.

882
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:54,511
It was really creepy. And it was not ...

883
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:58,350
Not good. I know.

884
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,481
Power will increase. And we can not control it.

885
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:03,253
So, what ... what do you succeed?

886
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,317
Yes. You think so, do not you?

887
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:09,264
Obviously, I can not keep giving her cakes.

888
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,528
But if I stop ...

889
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:20,299
I can not bite. I can not bite.

890
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,339
All right.

891
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,286
I think I need time for myself.

892
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,378
Then I'll be able to finish this.

893
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:34,514
You need more than just that, Bob.

894
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:40,393
You need plenty of time to finish this. Starting from this weird super baby.

895
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:45,457
You need to start thinking about something unusual.

896
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:59,270
You dare to appear in front of me like that without cleaning it first?

897
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,476
Clean yourself.

898
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,319
Bob, are you bringing anyone?

899
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:07,448
Only the baby alone.

900
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:11,221
I took my baby.

901
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:14,353
Really unusual.

902
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:23,497
You look absolutely terrible.

903
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,271
I ruined my car.

904
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:34,340
Then he hit me, and now he's changing.

905
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:38,411
I do not know what else to do.

906
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:39,512
I'm really tired.

907
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:43,458
If done correctly, being a parent is a heroic act.

908
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,357
If done properly.

909
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:48,421
And fortunately, you know me.

910
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:52,423
If you do not come to me, then you will be destroyed.

911
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:57,270
I've been designing clothes the hero, for your son.

912
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,365
Actually it was for Jack-Jack.

913
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:02,242
You also want me to make clothes for the baby?

914
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:05,475
I would not regard this as one of the emergency.

915
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:11,249
Well, you'll never know until I left it here for a while.

916
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:14,347
Leave it? Here?

917
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:19,293
I'm not a babysitter. I'm an artist.

918
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:23,458
I'm good at making clothes.

919
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:35,341
Did you see this?

920
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,450
Gosh.

921
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,323
Ya.

922
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:58,323
Glad you came to this heavy task, because I like to challenge myself.

923
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:03,499
And I'll take care of it properly, so you will see the changes later.

924
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:08,467
Edna become parents?

925
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,347
Attention, attention.

926
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,443
I want to thank all the people who have come here tonight ...

927
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:21,479
in order to support these heroes and encourage them to return to society.

928
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,321
You who make all of this happen.

929
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:32,427
While I only intercede you desire to achieve this.

930
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:35,301
I think of him as someone special.

931
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,305
You love it, you miss him.

932
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:41,242
Meet Elastigirl.

933
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:42,299
Go on up here.

934
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:46,338
Better yet, show yourself here.

935
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,283
I want you to have this.

936
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:50,478
A keepsake.

937
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:54,387
Thank you, Winston, Evelyn, and all the people who are here.

938
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:56,357
I'm flattered.

939
01:09:56,358 --> 01:10:01,318
And to all of you. It's thanks to you guys.

940
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:07,233
We only had a short time, which makes me want to announce something important.

941
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:14,471
Just now, the World Meeting led by hundreds of world leaders agreeing to be a hero ...

942
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,377
reappear.

943
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:26,346
Look, all leaders on this earth are to hold a meeting on the ship.

944
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:31,383
If you permit, we would attend.

945
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,422
As ...

946
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:41,266
There is something to ask of you first.

947
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:45,502
How can you split time between being a hero and an ordinary person?

948
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,340
Oh, could you briefly delay?

949
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:58,218
Yes, see you again.

950
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,368
- Hey, baby. - Hey.

951
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,278
- Where is Jack-Jack? - He's staying at home ...

952
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,339
- Edna become a nanny? - True.

953
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:28,475
And you do not object to this?

954
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:32,318
Yes. I do not mind.

955
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:36,485
I want to tell you something.

956
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,420
Sorry about Tommy.

957
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:44,364
I do not think to erase his memory, you will pay the consequence ...

958
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:48,302
of choices you never do. That's not fair.

959
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:50,237
I know.

960
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,367
And then I made it worse in the restaurant with trying to ...

961
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,377
Whatever it is, whatever it is ...

962
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,345
Forgive me.

963
01:11:57,346 --> 01:12:00,440
I always knew what the right thing to do.

964
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:04,213
But now, I'm not sure anymore.

965
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:07,347
I just want to be ...

966
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,485
a good father.

967
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:16,488
You're not a good father.

968
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:20,367
You're a super dad.

969
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:31,473
What heroes are allowed to drink while on duty?

970
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,449
I'm not on duty. Just ignore this costume.

971
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:39,353
I knew I should be up there, but I do not really like crowds.

972
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:42,448
You must be alone to keep the spirit. I know I am.

973
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,323
You're running from?

974
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,351
Well, you know, a problem the company.

975
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,386
But mostly my brother.

976
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:50,489
But you love him. You guys are the motor of this company. Yin and Yang.

977
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:53,366
Correct. I know it. He was great with communication.

978
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:57,463
Make them happy, welcome them, listen to what they want.

979
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:00,203
I never know what people want.

980
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,267
What do you want them?

981
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:06,338
Ease. People will redeem quality with ease, every time.

982
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,374
That might not be bad, but hey, it's easy.

983
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,285
I have no idea.

984
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,346
- You got a problem? - Yes, there is something.

985
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:16,221
That's too easy.

986
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:19,284
It's too easy?

987
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,521
- Anything?

988
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,497
What is that?

989
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:28,333
One monitor that it is a camera flashes.

990
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:31,363
Is not closed bersirkuit camera?

991
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:34,433
- Correct. - If so, how do they have it?

992
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:36,341
Maybe they meretasnya.

993
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:41,441
So security is really sophisticated, but the door was only locked simple?

994
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,418
Maybe he wants you to know.

995
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,283
He wants to get caught?

996
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,380
- He wants you to win. - That's absurd.

997
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:52,383
He's an intelligent man. There was no way he was not aware of such technology.

998
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:55,329
He's smart enough to do something with it.

999
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,298
People that we put people in jail is not arbitrary.

1000
01:13:57,332 --> 01:13:59,425
So? I see him as a loser

1001
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,233
Look, you win. You've got ...

1002
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,238
Wait!

1003
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,467
He must do to hypnotize someone

1004
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:08,238
is to make their eyes fixed on the screen.

1005
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:13,305
But what if the screen did not look like a screen?

1006
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:15,350
What if...

1007
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:23,257
He only person controlled by a person who is behind the scenes?

1008
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:25,453
You are right.

1009
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:43,506
I say let you sleep is a good thing.

1010
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:46,413
Over the past 17 hours.

1011
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:49,281
How do you feel?

1012
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:51,377
Super.

1013
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:57,415
I can not express how much I mernghargai Jack-Jack you cared for me, E.

1014
01:14:57,426 --> 01:15:00,395
Yes, I believe gratitude is very able to accept.

1015
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:04,456
Do not ever ask me to do it again, my schedule is really solid.

1016
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:11,372
I am kidding. I'm happy with it. I love your son.

1017
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:16,310
Most of thy evil. As babies in general, he has unlimited potential.

1018
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:22,375
As you know, this young man has so much expertise.

1019
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:27,218
They, dear?

1020
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:42,529
I understand the lack of sleep you can not judge something well.

1021
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,372
That could be anything. And your son is the same.

1022
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,276
Really has unlimited power potential.

1023
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:53,304
I've made something for him.

1024
01:15:58,487 --> 01:15:59,454
You put him in ...

1025
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:04,255
In a special room. Look what happened. And all would be fine.

1026
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:12,359
- your challenge is to make the baby can control his power. - More or less.

1027
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:16,428
I've worked in the field of music, and I know the baby responded to it well.

1028
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:19,372
Mainly Mozart.

1029
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:24,471
I make a special outfit for her.

1030
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:31,317
And with this tablet you can monitor your baby.

1031
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:34,322
Jeez ... what did he do?

1032
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:41,455
Well, this is Mozart. Just accept it. The important thing you can monitor and anticipate changes.

1033
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:44,398
Oh no. I had to take the cake.

1034
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:54,468
Needless cake. I learned overnight. If he did not get a cake he would turn out to be evil.

1035
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:59,245
Threatening danger. What does it mean?

1036
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:09,316
This means that fire. I suggest you put out the fire.

1037
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:14,260
And the use of other foods to disable it.

1038
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:18,323
Delicious and can be eaten.

1039
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,264
That's helpful.

1040
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:24,500
Although I have to admit this is the greatest accomplishments overnight.

1041
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:28,441
The tool has many functions we need to talk.

1042
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:31,241
Thanks again, E. For everything.

1043
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,405
How much do I owe you?

1044
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:40,378
Stop basimu ado. The pay is that I will be forever on the family's clothes designer

1045
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:48,489
until the end of time. But being a baby sitter, I do it for free.

1046
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:08,281
I already know taunting to extend your hand.

1047
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:11,376
Temperatures around here a little bit cold.

1048
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:14,253
Try to lengthen your arms, you will be destroyed.

1049
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:16,383
So you're Screenslaver?

1050
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:19,292
True. And it's not.

1051
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:23,424
Just tell me who created it. And spreading his message.

1052
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:24,489
What Winston knows?

1053
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:28,230
That I'm the Screenslaver? Certainly not.

1054
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:32,366
Can you imagine what they would do with technology hipnotisku?

1055
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,500
Worship what you do.

1056
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:38,343
Hey, I'm using the technology to destroy the confidence of people.

1057
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:40,337
As I take advantage of a super hero.

1058
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:42,213
Who I was put into prison?

1059
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:47,278
Only a courier. Useless. Aimless life.

1060
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:51,258
I must say I give you a good role.

1061
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:53,454
What does not make you disturbed an innocent man go to jail because of you?

1062
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:55,430
He's a fool.

1063
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,227
And he is stiff.

1064
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,493
I trust you.

1065
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,365
That is where you failed.

1066
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:03,269
- What? - Why do you believe me?

1067
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:04,499
Because I lend you bike?

1068
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:08,270
Since my sister made a theme song for you?

1069
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:09,436
We do not know each other.

1070
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:11,378
But you can trust me.

1071
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:16,510
It should be, is not it? Because you have the strength, and lavish costumes.

1072
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:21,352
And we have to rely on and trust.

1073
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:23,517
That's what my father believed.

1074
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:26,221
When our house was robbed.

1075
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:30,288
My mother wanted to hide. He begged my father to open the hidden room.

1076
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:34,428
But my father insisted to call a friend of his hero.

1077
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,371
He's dead. By useless.

1078
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:39,373
Foolishly.

1079
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:42,240
Waiting for the hero to save us.

1080
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:43,438
But why ... your sister ...

1081
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:45,469
He was a child.

1082
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:49,473
He remembers the days in which we have a hero.

1083
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:53,386
So, like a child, Winston still stupid.

1084
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:57,324
Mom and Dad ran for the heroes escape.

1085
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:01,455
And we have to surrender to hang our fate in the hands of others.

1086
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:04,488
Heroes make us weak.

1087
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:07,263
What are you going to kill me?

1088
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:09,396
No.

1089
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,465
Using you still better.

1090
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:17,467
You're going to help to make it illegal hero forever.

1091
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:24,513
Ready?

1092
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,283
Mata laser.

1093
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:29,313
Stop.

1094
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:32,326
That's not how. Look at this.

1095
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:35,387
Jack-Jack, are you ready?

1096
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:47,365
Do not make this baby shot in the house. Do you understand?

1097
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:50,242
It is interesting.

1098
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:53,271
We're going to teach him how to control his power. Okay?

1099
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:56,250
Display screen.

1100
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:57,440
He disappeares.

1101
01:20:57,452 --> 01:20:59,317
That's really cool.

1102
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:02,518
All right, good. Use it. Use. Press.

1103
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:10,260
You see the radar, its shape. That office. Use it to track him down, so where is he?

1104
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:12,365
There.

1105
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,336
OK. Exit. Time for cake.

1106
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:20,408
- Jack-Jack. - Keren.

1107
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,382
- Hello? - Elastigirl in trouble.

1108
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,508
What? What happened to him?

1109
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:33,248
Sorry, to tell you over the phone. Meet me on the plane Devtech.

1110
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:37,214
Devtech plane. I would arrive in 15 minutes.

1111
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:41,225
Lucius. Bob. Helen in trouble. I need someone to look after the children.

1112
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:46,257
- Wear your costume. It would be strange. - I'll get there. 15 minutes.

1113
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:52,239
I have to go. I'll be home soon. Lucius will arrive here.

1114
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:54,333
Do not make him shoot in the house. Okay?

1115
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:59,473
What happened with the plane in Devtech? And why are you wearing your super?

1116
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,256
What is a super mom clothes?

1117
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:14,262
He may need it. You never know.

1118
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,456
What happened?

1119
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:20,526
I do not know. But Father Lucius after getting the phone call about the mother and then go

1120
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,503
I thought you did not like to be a superhero.

1121
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:28,374
Yes, but I have to help my family. Wear.

1122
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:42,345
Hello, little friend.

1123
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:44,255
You are not safe.

1124
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:45,283
Deborah sent us to take you.

1125
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:52,392
Well, the father had just told me to keep them.

1126
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:55,495
Because these children are safe.

1127
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:58,233
I understand, it is sometimes confusing.

1128
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,231
Go. You understand, right, Miss ...

1129
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:02,334
Voyd.

1130
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:05,346
Ninth Voyd.

1131
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:07,440
Good night.

1132
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:20,250
Happily, he asked us to take you too.

1133
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:22,422
As ...

1134
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:25,262
That will not hold them for long.

1135
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:27,461
Quick save yourselves.

1136
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:31,530
Come on!

1137
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:39,312
To my car!

1138
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:51,358
Vi, what happened?

1139
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:12,446
It works.

1140
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:20,251
lncredibile open the door.

1141
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:22,519
Step into.

1142
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:31,456
Turn on the navigation system.

1143
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:35,493
- Frog fire. - Jack Rubber.

1144
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:41,202
No.

1145
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:44,268
We must flee.

1146
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:52,514
- What news? - Good news and bad news.

1147
01:24:52,520 --> 01:25:00,450
We find him, physically well but she was not aware of.

1148
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,431
Strange house.

1149
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:14,341
Helen.

1150
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:17,310
Helen, what are you ...

1151
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:27,479

01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:46,365
lncredibile spinning.

1153
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:56,508
We could not go, they all wear glasses.

1154
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:59,419
They are under the influence of a person.

1155
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:03,447
But how can we restore them?

1156
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:14,231
Okay, the man was eyeing us, but with our power, this car ...

1157
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:18,296
Quiet.

1158
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:33,243
lncredibile continue the journey.

1159
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:39,258
The boy fled but we caught Bob Parr.

1160
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:43,230
Take him to the ship immediately.

1161
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:49,395

1162
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:55,273
Ah, if lncredibile has fashion boat.

He does what I say.

1166
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:22,493
- We did not plan this, Ralph. - What do you mean? We are here, right?

1167
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:28,373
Yes, we are here. We should be up there.

1168
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:34,246
Okay, the ejection seat lncredibile.

1169
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,240

01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:39,447
- Do not! - We go.

1171
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,422
Come on.

1172
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:55,234
Hello, glad you could come. Welcome aboard.

1173
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:09,373
- Where's our star, the show was about to begin. - He can not appear.

1174
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:12,250
He will join another time.

1175
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:14,414
The attention of the audience.

1176
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:18,415
This ship is the largest ship on the planet.

1177
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:24,261
So, hold onto something because we will be moving quickly.

1178
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:44,512
We must look for mom and dad. Stay here, I'll look for them.

1179
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:47,454
Wait, who will oversee the back here?

1180
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:49,480
Face it, I will not be long.

1181
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:52,357
Wait! Wait!

1182
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:56,456
This is important, they are in trouble, his fate is in our hands.

1183
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:58,260
Understand?

1184
01:28:58,266 --> 01:29:02,293
Make her laugh but do not be noisy.

1185
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:23,450
Jack-Jack.

1186
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:35,332
Jack-Jack.

1187
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:10,269
- Jack-Jack. - They know we are here.

1188
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,499
I found my father and mother ... Where is Jack-Jack?

1189
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:16,307
What? Your job is only one.

1190
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:19,302
Tracker. Use the tracer.

1191
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:24,279
- He's up? - Is he moving?

1192
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:26,310
Let's go.

1193
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:31,314
Hey, little baby. You are very...

1194
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:37,354
And here's their ... our super hero.

1195
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:39,424
I told you they would be fine.

1196
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:41,459
Hey, what do you make new glasses?

1197
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:45,233
Yes, fashionable, good, right?

1198
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:48,470
Simple and all can wear ... and we are airborne in ...

1199
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:51,273
3, 2, 1.

1200
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:58,310
This is a historical moment, we will all soon witness a very rare thing.

1201
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:02,255
We agree with the outside world.

1202
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:06,257
We agree to correct bad decisions

1203
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:09,286

so that they are beneficial to the world.

1206
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:21,306
You all represent a commitment to superheroes.

1207
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,402
Ambassador Salomon.

1208
01:31:23,444 --> 01:31:25,503
Yes, the harder she can not hear you.

1209
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:27,504
- Thank you very much. - Thanks ambassador

1210
01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:30,346
to support krusialmu.

1211
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:34,310
No more than you deserve for the first signature

1212
01:31:34,355 --> 01:31:39,315
in the Charter of the International Super Hero.

1213
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:56,469
My goodness!

1214
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,447
Put out the fire.

1215
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:09,380
He is coming.

1216
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:18,328
Is he okay?

1217
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:22,234
I told you to take care of today ...

1218
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:48,224
No!

1219
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:50,220
Give it to me cake.

1220
01:32:50,264 --> 01:32:53,324
Cake again?

1221
01:33:05,313 --> 01:33:08,476
- See you later. - Get back!

1222
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,448
- Damn. - Through this way.

1223
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:21,327
Once again the world is becoming a super back.

1224
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:28,234
Looking ahead, come on. Next to everything.

1225
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:30,396
March. Come on, line up.

1226
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:33,339
Everything smile.

1227
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,440
Continue Phase 2.

1228
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:50,288
You always made it difficult, just to tidy up your carelessness.

1229
01:33:50,324 --> 01:33:56,388
Your body is weak, and you will receive a reward for it.

1230
01:33:56,397 --> 01:33:59,457
We no longer serve you. We only serve ourselves.

1231
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:03,368
We wish the best survived.

1232
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:08,298
That scene is very harmonious one.

1233
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:13,473
And before advertising, be careful.

1234
01:34:27,294 --> 01:34:29,353
- Emergency ... - Let him call.

1235
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:31,422
Superheroes take over the bridge by force.

1236
01:34:31,432 --> 01:34:34,401
- Repeat. - Now!

1237
01:34:44,278 --> 01:34:49,215
A little more ... stop.

1238
01:34:53,387 --> 01:34:55,514
What? Baby?

1239
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:58,492
mother and father.

1240
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:04,390
Jack-like, no!

1241
01:35:05,232 --> 01:35:10,363
Super baby? No, no.

1242
01:35:12,273 --> 01:35:15,470
No, no! Put him down.

1243
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:20,269
Mother. Catch this.

1244
01:35:27,288 --> 01:35:29,518
No!

1245
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:34,392
- Hey, it's me. - Yes, that's what I thought last time.

1246
01:35:34,428 --> 01:35:39,365
You come for us?

1247
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,301
- Do not be angry. - Oh dear.

1248
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:44,271
How can I do that?

1249
01:35:44,305 --> 01:35:46,364
I am proud.

1250
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:49,501
Not intend to ruin the atmosphere, but we are no where?

1251
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:54,470
- What is the problem Devtech? - Evelyn Deavor, controlling ...

1252
01:35:54,482 --> 01:35:57,315
we.

1253
01:35:57,351 --> 01:36:02,311
- Where the wheel? - Did I do that?

1254
01:36:02,323 --> 01:36:03,449
Seragammu.GuavaBerry

1255
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:06,426
Capture.

1256
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:11,262
Phase 3, continue phase 3.

1257
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:15,292
Why are children here? Do not you go home?

1258
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:18,499
I went to the house, just ask them.

1259
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:20,269
He's lying.

1260
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:23,333
Okay, you should not ...

1261
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:27,406
Caution!

1262
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:35,251
- Jack-Jack, had the power? - We'll talk later.

1263
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:11,349
Mata laser.

1264
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:39,486
Come on follow me.

1265
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,488
- We're done? - You'll be safe here.

1266
01:37:41,488 --> 01:37:45,322
Secure? Safe from what?

1267
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:49,352
- Diplomats, superheroes ... - They hypnotized.

1268
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:52,355
What have you done?

1269
01:37:55,269 --> 01:37:57,294
Evelyn, he fled.

1270
01:37:57,304 --> 01:38:00,501
- Well, go after him. Complete your mission. - I can not just leave.

1271
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:04,375
How are the kids? Jack-Jack?

1272
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:07,505
Go, we can handle this.

1273
01:38:08,315 --> 01:38:10,249
Voyd, come with me.

1274
01:38:10,251 --> 01:38:12,481
- I'm going to turn off the engine. - I'm going to slow down the boat.

1275
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:16,250
Wait, where the gun?

1276
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:18,451
Sitting now!

1277
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:36,400
- For the sake of good. - No!

1278
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:39,310
thanks.

1279
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:53,292
- What is your plan? - Take me to the top of the jet.

1280
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:18,441
Hey, you do this. Can you do it again?

1281
01:39:18,452 --> 01:39:21,285
- Do you want me back? - What?

1282
01:39:21,322 --> 01:39:25,349
- Can not do that? - No, I do not Protects crushed crusher.

1283
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:28,453
Entry into the engine room. Forget, not enough time.

1284
01:39:28,495 --> 01:39:33,398
When you were asked to return to normal, what are you doing?

1285
01:39:35,469 --> 01:39:41,465
Welcome to the airlines Elastigirl, we reached cruising altitude.

1286
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:47,447
For the sake of your safety wear seat belts, or silent and calm.

1287
01:39:47,448 --> 01:39:51,316
It's all about you.

1288
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:02,262
- I can not enter the engine room. - We have to do something.

1289
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:03,456
I've tried to slow down but to no avail.

1290
01:40:03,464 --> 01:40:05,398
Hey, how about reversing the boat?

1291
01:40:05,432 --> 01:40:06,490
That's not a good idea.

1292
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:09,298
- That means, we will be outside. - Yes!

1293
01:40:09,303 --> 01:40:14,240
If we put the brakes on the reef and change kincirnya we can keep the ship from the city.

1294
01:40:14,274 --> 01:40:15,502
- It might work. - I'll divert the ship,

1295
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:18,272
- you bend kincirnya. - Using the stairs?

1296
01:40:18,278 --> 01:40:21,338
It was under water, how? Oh, unbelievable.

1297
01:40:21,382 --> 01:40:23,441
- Come on, kids. - Dad!

1298
01:40:23,484 --> 01:40:28,251
I know this will work, but if it did not work when we crash,

1299
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:31,416
shield will protect this ship.

1300
01:40:31,425 --> 01:40:35,384
I have to live here, along with Jack-Jack.

1301
01:40:35,396 --> 01:40:36,454
That's just my daughter.

1302
01:40:36,497 --> 01:40:41,332
Come on, steered to the right.

1303
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:49,433
You know what's bad?

1304
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:56,508
The work is not recognized in your life, by your good friend.

1305
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:59,348
I wish I had ...

1306
01:40:59,353 --> 01:41:02,345
that ability.

1307
01:41:03,323 --> 01:41:06,486
The latest news, still no radio contact

1308
01:41:06,527 --> 01:41:12,329
The boat had changed direction and headed for the city at high speed.

1309
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:17,360
Hear.

1310
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:23,369
- After I turn this boat, you press the button. - Okay, dad.

1311
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:26,345
Now drop anchor ...

1312
01:41:28,482 --> 01:41:32,316
Reputation as a super hero is destroyed.

1313
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:36,311
You'll never be legal.

1314
01:41:36,323 --> 01:41:38,257
Never?

1315
01:41:38,258 --> 01:41:39,225
No.

1316
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:41,227
- At all? - No.

1317
01:41:41,228 --> 01:41:44,391
Not at all?

1318
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:50,370
Hypoxia, lack of oxygen in your brain.

1319
01:41:56,477 --> 01:42:00,470
You will feel weak and then you will die.

1320
01:42:00,514 --> 01:42:04,473
- I do not want to die. - No one wants to die.

1321
01:42:04,518 --> 01:42:06,383
Seriously?

1322
01:42:06,386 --> 01:42:09,446
Pity you.

1323
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:32,503
Everything, we have to go to the back of the boat. Superheroes protect the ambassador.

1324
01:42:32,513 --> 01:42:35,380
Go!

1325
01:42:36,517 --> 01:42:41,318
He spent too long in the water.

1326
01:42:47,394 --> 01:42:52,354
- Pull him. - Wait, is too early.

1327
01:43:04,311 --> 01:43:08,372
- He's going to die. - Patience!

1328
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:25,226
The ship turned. It worked.

1329
01:43:27,401 --> 01:43:31,303
- Now! - Ralph, now!

1330
01:43:32,506 --> 01:43:36,306
Let's open the parachute.

1331
01:43:37,411 --> 01:43:41,245
Open the chute.

1332
01:43:42,316 --> 01:43:46,252
Helen, use a parachute.

1333
01:43:52,326 --> 01:43:55,420
We're going to die!

1334
01:44:15,349 --> 01:44:18,341
I missed the first drama Jack-Jack?

1335
01:44:18,352 --> 01:44:22,345
Actually, you missed the first 17 years.

1336
01:44:34,368 --> 01:44:38,395
The fact you saved me does not make you right.

1337
01:44:38,438 --> 01:44:42,374
- But, that keep you alive. - And I'm grateful for that.

1338
01:44:42,409 --> 01:44:45,401
Sorry, but what I know you?

1339
01:44:45,412 --> 01:44:49,348
Sorry, he will not accept to be treated like that again.

1340
01:44:49,383 --> 01:44:52,375
First of all, Violet I like you.

1341
01:44:52,419 --> 01:44:59,382
And who knows the future? But I have a good feeling with you all.

1342
01:44:59,393 --> 01:45:00,382
A good feeling?

1343
01:45:00,427 --> 01:45:02,395
What should we worry?

1344
01:45:02,396 --> 01:45:05,229
You must.

1345
01:45:05,265 --> 01:45:07,290
I see what you did before, it was incredible.

1346
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:11,362
And not everyone can do it.

1347
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:16,242
My favorite car.

1348
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:32,324
On extraordinary services they have done

1349
01:45:32,359 --> 01:45:38,298
With this super hero status restated legal.

1350
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:50,466
- You do not know, right? - No, wait ...

1351
01:45:50,477 --> 01:45:55,244
- What do you girls who wear the mask? - I'm Violet.

1352
01:45:55,282 --> 01:45:57,443
I'm Tony.

1353
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:09,454
- Tony, this is my mother. - Nice to meet you.

1354
01:46:09,463 --> 01:46:12,227
- It's my father. - We never met.

1355
01:46:12,265 --> 01:46:16,463
- This is embarrassing ... my brother Dash. - I'm short.

1356
01:46:16,503 --> 01:46:22,499
And baby Jack-Jack. I tried to reduce so one parent.

1357
01:46:22,509 --> 01:46:25,376
We're all going to watch a movie, honey.

1358
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:30,373
Too early, we decided on the theater. Not like that?

1359
01:46:30,417 --> 01:46:37,380
He jokes, they just drove us to the theater. They have other business.

1360
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:40,360
So, I think you guys close.

1361
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:44,353
- I guess. - We can get closer.

1362
01:46:58,345 --> 01:46:59,471
Let us out.

1363
01:46:59,479 --> 01:47:03,472
Sorry, Tony. Buy popcorn, find a chair for me.

1364
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:08,477
I was back before the preview ends.
