2
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:36,415
Violation 2-712, Rick Dicker interrogating agent.

3
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,419
Please specify your name.

4
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,489
Uh... Tony.

5
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,424
Tony Rydinger.

6
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,393
Tell me about what happened.

7
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,489
Well there is this girl in my class.

8
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,397
I saw it on the track running.

9
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,368
You, Violet is not it?

10
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,334
That's me.

11
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,327
I know little about him, but he changed.

12
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,500
He was more relaxed, confident, cool, sweet.

13
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,339
I asked her to go to the cinema.

14
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,311
- So, Friday? Friday. - Friday.

15
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,371
And I went from there.

16
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:12,317
Not long after that, this incident occurred in the parking lot.

17
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:27,461
Meet the Underminer.

18
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:32,495
I was always under but nothing is beneath me.

19
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:36,306
And the situation is very strange and when I saw these boots.

20
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,436
- You two stay here. - Are we really going to do this?

21
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,468
It is still illegal, right?

22
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,504
They look like a super hero.

23
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,415
- They're going to lose him? - Oh okay.

24
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,283
One of you berjagalah on the perimeter, secure the people from here.

25
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,344
You have to keep Jack-jack.

26
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,413
- I think we are in this together. - You heard your mother.

27
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,323
Create a trampoline.

28
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,354
I guard the perimeter.

29
00:09:57,364 --> 00:10:00,356
You can not go anywhere. Come back here!

30
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,300
I saw a chance to get out of there.

31
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:05,499
But I know the sound of one of the children.

32
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:10,272
The girl's voice. He was angry and threw his mask. And that's it!

33
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,278
Oh, Tony!

34
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,281
Hi. It's not what you think.

35
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,513
This is too weird I can not handle it, I fled.

36
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,349
I feel bad about it.

37
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:23,323
Maybe I should have said '' Hi '' or something.

38
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,291
Not because he Superhero illegal.

39
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,351
And is not I do not like girls who are stronger, I'm pretty confident.

40
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:29,420
Virility problems.

41
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,430
What is that?

42
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,432
Did you tell this to anyone else?

43
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,435
- Your parents? - No. They do not like to know anything.

44
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,232
You know what I mean?

45
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:41,401
- I know, son. - I like this girl, Mr. Dicker should I go with him Friday night.

46
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:44,502
And now would be a strange situation.

47
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:47,480
I wish I could say sorry to him.

48
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,449
You're going to say, son.

49
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,281
You're going to say it.

50
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,294
Come on!

51
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:29,253
Let's just say you've had in the blast from below!

52
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,378
- Underminer! We meet again. - What?

53
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:02,386
Oh, come on. Now he was trapped inside.

54
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,491
Oh!

55
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,461
lncredibles!

56
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:21,237
Introduce Jackhammer!

57
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,467
Feel this.

58
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:31,478
Until found!

59
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:50,301
No no no.

60
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:58,240
Everyone, back off, okay? Retreat.

61
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:02,471
Dash, do not make me keep the baby.

62
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:09,353
I tried to stop him, and Underminer escape.

63
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:13,292
Does it ever make you stop ... Bob, monorailnya!

64
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,459
Frozone! Already!

65
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,432
We have to stop this thing before it destroys the town hall.

66
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,466
I'll try to keep him away from the building.

67
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,414
Hey, lady.

68
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:46,520
Thank you very much, young man.

69
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:55,299
Violet!

70
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,350
Stop!

71
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,251
All stop!

72
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:42,415
Alert, father.

73
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,441
Dash!

74
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,283
Violet, who's taking care of Jack-Jack?

75
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:52,314
- Dad in charge ... - Violet, take him.

76
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,426
This thing is headed to City Hall.

77
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:05,337
Mother needs help.

78
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:16,213
Look at this, this is our chance, follow them, follow Frozone.

79
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:29,486
Bob!

80
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:33,260
Help me with this pillar.

81
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,373
Supposedly it can stop it.

82
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,441
Children, what are you doing? Get out of here!

83
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,316
It's going to explode!

84
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,514
There is no more time!

85
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,457
We did it!

86
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:10,265
Do not move, super hero!

87
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,364
Oh, what we've done.

88
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:20,277
Hey, wait, Mr. Zone?

89
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:24,250
Sorry, I should not be here.

90
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:27,276
That seems to be wrong, is not it?

91
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,518
Maybe you're interested in changing the law?

92
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:36,261
Superheroes including Frozone, Mr. lncredibles, and Elasticgirl ...

93
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:38,322
prevent further damage in the city.

94
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,424
The Underminer still unknown.

95
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,298
We did not start this conflict.

96
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,326
And you do not end well!

97
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,362
- You stop Underminer to destroy more? - No.

98
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:49,274
- Did you stop him rob a bank? - No.

99
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,277
- Did you catch it? - No.

100
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,271
The bank was already insured, we have the infrastructure to overcome this problem ...

101
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:59,513
if you did not do anything this is all still going to happen.

102
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,283
You would rather we did not do anything?

103
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:05,281
So true.

104
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,353
You did not help.

105
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:15,392
If you want to get out of the hole, you have to put the first shovel.

106
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,339
Wow it's awful.

107
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:26,243
Dad, maybe this is not the best time to tell you this, but ...

108
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,305
Something happened today.

109
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:32,411
A child, and my mask.

110
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:52,294
Okay, Rick, a friend of Violet, Tony, see it without using a mask.

111
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:55,433
- There are other info? - I do not know her last name Rydinger.

112
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:59,434
Tony Rydinger. I'll check it out.

113
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,311
Bob, Helen.

114
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:04,283
I want to talk if you do not mind.

115
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,417
The program is stopped.

116
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,284
What?

117
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:13,315
Politicians do not understand people who do good things because it was the right move.

118
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,225
Make them nervous.

119
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:20,358
They target Superheroes many years ago, and today they need.

120
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:23,336
Anyway, I'm done.

121
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,329
I'm worried about two weeks at the motel was the best that I can do for you.

122
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,365
- It's not much. - You have a lot of help, Rick.

123
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,240
We will not forget it.

124
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,508
Well, an honor working with you guys, good people.

125
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,381
Thank you for everything. And good luck.

126
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:40,410
Yes, you too.

127
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,502
Did you wash your hands?

128
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,240
With the soap?

129
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,276
Is it dry?

130
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,543
What? Is this all the vegetables?

131
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,449
Who ordered this vegetable all?

132
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:14,477
I order it. It's good for you.

133
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:17,388
Are we going to talk about it?

134
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,483
- What? - elephant in this room.

135
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:20,515
What elephant?

136
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,290
I do not think so.

137
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,296
- You mean about today? - Yes.

138
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,321
What's with today?

139
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:26,491
We all make mistakes.

140
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,468
For example, you should keep children Jack-Jack.

141
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:33,235
Keeping the baby, while you do the things that are important.

142
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,297
We already talked about this.

143
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,298
You're not mature enough to decide this.

144
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,334
- We are old enough to help. - Yes!

145
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,278
Is not that what you say to us, dad?

146
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,340
Yes, well, help it can mean many things.

147
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:46,250
- But we have to help where there is a sense of trust. - Yes.

148
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,311
- Are you glad we help today? - I know. But...

149
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,346
- You said you were proud of us. - Well, I used to, I'm proud.

150
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,224
We want to fight criminals.

151
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,251
No, you can not.

152
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,230
You said different situation now.

153
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,357
And that is right. On the island.

154
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,300
But I do not mean that from now on ...

155
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,497
Now we do not use our strength back again.

156
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:08,406
- That's what makes me strong. - I did not say ... what?

157
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:09,499
Someone says.

158
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,340
Can we eat it. Dinner.

159
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,370
While still hot.

160
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,245
Are we doing something wrong?

161
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,408
- Yes. - No.

162
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,442
We did not do anything wrong.

163
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:22,284
Superhero illegal.

164
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,516
Whether it's fair or not, it's legal.

165
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:26,492
The law should be fair. That's why we teach it to our children.

166
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:29,495
- We follow the law. - Although the law to harass?

167
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:34,262
If it was unjust law is no law to replace it. Otherwise there will be chaos.

168
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,395
That's what happened today.

169
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,276
I thought this was cool.

170
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,277
What?

171
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:49,270
As a crime against the family.

172
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,341
That's cool.

173
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,442
But that's over.

174
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,352
But this is happening in the world.

175
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:56,345
We have to adapt.

176
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,323
Is the situation worse now?

177
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:01,225
Fine state.

178
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,388
May I have permission?

179
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,496
How long are we at the motel, father?

180
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:12,471
Soon, dear.

181
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:20,368
What we will do?

182
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,381
I do not know.

183
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:25,351
- Maybe Dicker will find something. - Dicker is no longer there, Bob.

184
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:28,411
All our thoughts become Superheroes again, it was just wishful thinking.

185
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,354
One of us had to work.

186
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,414
One of us?

187
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,482
You do not stand working in an insurance company.

188
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:37,259
- I can not stand cheating them. - I know it's hard for you.

189
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:41,461
- Maybe it's my turn to work in the private sector and you keep ... - No, I did it.

190
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,265
I need to do this.

191
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:49,332
- Do you know where coat and my tie? - Burned when our house burned.

192
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,240
Ya.

193
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:53,371
We can not depend on anyone else now, Bob.

194
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,402
There is only us.

195
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:57,383
We can not wait for ...

196
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:07,283
There were no guards manning pool.

197
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,419
Swim responsibility own risk.

198
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,293
Oh, where are you today?

199
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,321
I know you missed all the fun.

200
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:15,334
Do not get angry, because I do not come to your party.

201
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:19,294
I'm not as good as you, and besides I know the police will deliver you.

202
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:22,502
- Yes. That's the power of Bob. - Yes, yes.

203
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:25,443
I heard the program was discontinued.

204
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,345
How long are you in this motel?

205
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,404
2 weeks.

206
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,382
And you know the offer is still valid.

207
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:34,375
You are very good, and the five of us. We do not want to do that to your wife.

208
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:36,355
The door is always open.

209
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,414
You know the news is not always bad.

210
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:45,227
While you're on hold, I was approached by a man who represents a wealthy man.

211
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:46,323
Winston Deavor.

212
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:50,496
She wanted to talk to me and you both about the problem Superhero.

213
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:54,439
I've checked it, she was fine, wanted to recruit Dicker, he wanted to meet.

214
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,533
Oh, my goodness, the more problems Superhero?

215
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,306
We just got out of trouble.

216
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:00,244
We're coming.

217
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,441
Tonight, I'll go now.

218
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:04,473
Enjoy it, I do not want to get involved.

219
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,349
He wants us three.

220
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:09,480
Unfortunately, at least we hear first what was going on katakannya.

221
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:12,457
Do you have an address, I meet you there.

222
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,483
Superhero costumes go with us?

223
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:19,227
Yes. Wear your costume Superheroes long.

224
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,428
I sensed that he wanted.

225
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,271
You're going where?

226
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:31,243
- The air is very fresh tonight. - You know who the phone ...

227
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:34,304
I know what to dlakukan.

228
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:44,290
Security card to you.

229
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:46,292
Please come this way.

230
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:51,252
Sir, are you a fan I weigh, I'm a fan ... Right.

231
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,356
Shit.

232
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:18,519
I Love Superheroes!

233
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:22,290
I understand your struggle.

234
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,353
Winston Deavor. You can call me Wins.

235
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:27,299
It was very nice to meet you. Frozone!

236
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,267
- Elasticgirl. - Nice to meet you.

237
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,530
- Mr. lncredibles.- Halo.

238
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:39,342
~ Mr. lncredibles, lncredibles, catch criminals, pow pow!

239
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:42,314
~ Who's the cat that got you ...

240
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:45,375
~ When survived virtually no chance ...

241
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:48,478
~ Frozone, Frozone.

242
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,355
~ Frozone!

243
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:52,449
Ya!

244
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:55,393
I will tell you about what all of this, and this is ...

245
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:59,229
Oh, hello ... Superhero. I am sorry...

246
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:05,226
- It's strange sister, Evelyn. - I'm not weird, you do not need to be so, Winston.

247
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:06,330
Spectacular.

248
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:11,275
My father was very proud that I know you from afar.

249
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,507
He used to call you, the last defense.

250
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:16,277
He is a staunch supporter of you.

251
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,408
He donated on behalf of the Superhero.

252
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:21,420
To raise funds to build a statue in the park Dynaguy Avery.

253
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:23,422
He knew many Superhero personally.

254
00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:30,295
Even installed a phone with a direct line to Gazerbeam and Bionic for emergencies.

255
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,423
She loved it. He showed it to everyone.

256
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:35,401
He was disappointed once when you are forced to go into hiding.

257
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:40,372
My father believed the world a dangerous place without you.

258
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:43,308
You know he's right.

259
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,469
There was theft.

260
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:51,280
My dad called Gazerbeam, direct line ...

261
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:52,409
No answer.

262
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,352
She called Bionic.

263
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:55,342
No answer.

264
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:58,516
Superheroes just become illegal.

265
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:03,393
The thief was seeing my dad called, and shot him.

266
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:06,226
So...

267
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,357
Definitely hard to ...

268
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,231
Especially for the mother.

269
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,293
He died a few months later.

270
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:12,293
Broken hearted.

271
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:16,274
If Superheroes are not forced to hide this will never happen.

272
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:19,472
Or the father could take the mother to a secure room so knew there was a robbery.

273
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:24,439
I totally disagree, but we do not do it now.

274
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:30,320
The point is no one thought we could run the company my father.

275
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:33,417
And Evelyn as a designer, and myself as the operator ...

276
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:37,486
Make us build Devtech become what it is today.

277
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:41,490
- the last communication company in the world. - Bigger than ever.

278
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:45,265
The right position to make justify the wrong thing.

279
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,239
Because it then there is this meeting.

280
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,433
Let me ask you guys something.

281
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:52,434
- What are the main causes you have to hide? - Ignorance.

282
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,345
Perception.

283
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,543
Take for example today with Underminer. A difficult situation.

284
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,314
You are faced with many difficult decisions.

285
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:01,411
So true.

286
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,512
I can not.

287
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:05,388
Because I do not see it.

288
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:07,291
Likewise with other people.

289
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,454
So when you guys fight bad guys like today ...

290
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:12,396
people do not see fights or situations memukainya ...

291
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,457
They see what is desired by politicians ...

292
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,401
They see the destruction, and they see you.

293
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:21,430
So if you want people to change their perception about you guys the Heroes Super ...

294
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:25,410
We need you to share you with the world's perception.

295
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:26,435
How do we do it?

296
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,310
With the camera.

297
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:31,441
You share perceptions with the world.

298
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,474
How do we do it?

299
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:36,319
We put a small camera like that into your Super Hero costume.

300
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:37,447
Wow. Very small.

301
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,447
- And incredible shape. - Thank you.

302
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:40,481
I designed it myself.

303
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:45,361
We have the resources, lobbyists, connections across the world and a very important ...

304
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,355
- Insurance. - Insurance is the key.

305
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,233
What we need now is Superhero.

306
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:55,434
That means three of you, come help me make Superhero legal again.

307
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:59,343
It sounds great, let's get started, what our first task?

308
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:07,377
Enthusiastic was nice, keep it, but it's our first step, Elasticgirl our hero.

309
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,217
Better than me?

310
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,246
Ya.

311
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:16,422
I mean, he's great, really, but you know ...

312
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:17,394
Do you know...

313
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,389
With all due respect, let's not rush, insurance paid for everything.

314
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,392
It's just the beginning, okay?

315
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:26,405
Wait, what say?

316
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:27,429
I'm a mess?

317
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:33,434
Evelyn analysis when you fight crime during the five years prior to hide.

318
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,505
Figures Elasticgirl can explain himself.

319
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,413
Gee was not a fair comparison.

320
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,476
All major problem, need big solutions.

321
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:44,422
Of course. We will solve all the problems together.

322
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:50,259
After a perfect launch with Elasticgirl.

323
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:53,528
- So, what do you think? - What do I think?

324
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:59,394
- I do not know. - What do you mean you do not know.

325
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:04,240
A few hours ago, you told us to be a super hero fantasy.

326
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:07,337
Now you get an offer of a lifetime and you do not know?

327
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,508
It's not that easy, Bob. I do not want troublesome children.

328
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,280
- I also. - From prison, Bob.

329
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:17,484
How did you do it? By rejecting the opportunity to change it.

330
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:19,320
Forcing them off as they are?

331
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:21,452
What happens with who they are? They're just kids.

332
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,327
Children with strength, which makes them super.

333
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,490
Between them they decided to use force or not.

334
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:30,299
- This is going to benefit them. - Listen, this is not a good time to go.

335
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:34,330
Dashiel have a problem with homework, Violet concerned with the man she loves.

336
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:38,469
- Tony. And Jack ... - Jack? What is up with her?

337
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:43,244
Well, nothing wrong with it. But normal baby needs attention.

338
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:46,241
- I'm not sure I can go. - Of course you can go.

339
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:52,418
You have to, so I, we ... Could stronger together again. So our children can have fun.

340
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:57,519
- So you have that option. - Well, yes. So I can have that choice.

341
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,328
And I will do a terrific job.

342
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,302
Although they say about me.

343
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:07,238
But they want you.

344
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:14,338
And you will be great. Actually.

345
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:20,349
That's really bad. Why can not you ...

346
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:23,379
That's good to want the glory, you know. But...

347
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,391
What are the options? One, Lucius right, well paid,

348
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:30,385
rather than being in the motel, and the kids better, including our children.

349
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,490
Or second, I'm looking for a job within two weeks and return.

350
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,334
You know it's crazy, is not it?

351
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,328
To help my family, I had to lie down on the shore, I must destroy ...

352
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:42,398
- You will be enormous. - I know I would.

353
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:43,466
But what about you? We have children.

354
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,273
I'll take care of children. No problem. Easy.

355
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:51,375
Easy, huh? You brag. If there are problems, I will cancel and go home.

356
00:30:51,384 --> 00:30:55,411
You do not need to, I can, you just leave. Do it.

357
00:30:55,454 --> 00:31:00,221
Just do it, I'll give you a bear.

358
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:06,330
- It Deavor. - It Elastigirl, I agree.

359
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:12,326
Mr. Deavor, is unusual. But you are too generous.

360
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,305
Nonsense. This is at least what we can do.

361
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:17,503
We are now colleagues. Can not have my partner stayed at the motel.

362
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,479
- Whose house? A house? - It's my house.

363
00:31:20,513 --> 00:31:24,449
I have several. You live how long it takes.

364
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,280
I do not know what to say.

365
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,446
How to thank you?

366
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:33,290
- This is our new home? - I think so, take it easy, champ.

367
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,384
- It's ours. - Yes.

368
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,362
- Mother. - Look at this place.

369
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:41,298
Deavor buy from certain kolongmerat who like to come and go.

370
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,463
Without visible, so this house has some hidden place.

371
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:49,440
Things you will not be exposed. With one unknown.

372
00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:51,433
This house has a spacious yard.

373
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:55,436
- This ... Is not it redundant. - Have the field.

374
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:59,474
- What do you prefer in the motel? - It's a pool.

375
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:04,518
- What exactly is the mother's new job? - Most importantly, we are out of the motel.

376
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:08,357
I love the new mother's job.

377
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,331
Wow, look at the water feature.

378
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,278
to live please.

379
00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:39,253
- Oh no! - Stop it.

380
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,452
- Watch out! - Dad!

381
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:44,361
Log in to the pool. No!

382
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:49,468
I, nothing ...

383
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:55,399
Dark and antiques. I Elastigirl. I, you know ...

384
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:58,376
- Flexible. I mean ... No. - Are you designing this?

385
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,379
Of a man named Alexander Gawkin.

386
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:07,318
Glad it's you, not me, because you will have to do with this record.

387
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:11,346
- What? - Elastigirl, the vehicle is in the garage. Evelyn

388
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:19,458
- Motor new Elastic. - Elasticycle? I do not know you have a motor.

389
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,467
Hey, I got a Mohawk. There's a lot about me that you do not know.

390
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,368
Ya, Mohawk?

391
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,464
You did not miss anything.

392
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:34,244
- Oh, yes. This one electric. - What does it mean?

393
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,452
- Errors. Sorry. Should improve. - You will be enormous.

394
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:45,389
- I'll be great. And you too. - We'll both be great.

395
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,415
Goodbye My Love.

396
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:12,507
- Wait a minute, it Elastigirl? - Elastigirl.

397
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:23,427
Hei, Elastigirl.

398
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:27,457
Elastigirl tiba.

399
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:31,459
- You're right on time. - It spins five times.

400
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:39,276
Look at it. New place. You want to make the company's skyscrapers.

401
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:43,270
- You arrive in the city with the highest crime. - The strange thing, is not it? We're talking about.

402
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:46,409
It's like a playground superheroes.

403
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:52,481
Not much sugar in my custody.

404
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:58,228
- Where's the mother? - He's out. He was at his new job.

405
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,494
- Be a hero. - I think superheroes are still illegal.

406
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,365
They are illegal for now.

407
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:06,371
So mothers be paid for breaking the rules.

408
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:10,240
He did not violate ... He was in Africa for a super hero.

409
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,505
- It's a new job. - So, the mother went.

410
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:17,346
Illegally to tour why she should be illegal.

411
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:21,342
Hey Hey. Bus tiba.

412
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:25,312
Grab your things, Dash, go ...

413
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,392
Put your homework on the bag.

414
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,485
Goodbye.

415
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:42,229
We will be fine. You do not ask the tough questions

416
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:47,345
Well, do not worry.

417
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:51,315
- What am I? - It's weird. Many crimes.

418
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:56,378
True, you're in the middle of the worst crime area of ââthe city. It was perfect.

419
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:59,448
- This is a friend to play superheroes. - Friends playing superheroes, either.

420
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:03,427
No, when we were hiding. My husband always said alert.

421
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:07,364
Waiting for something to happen. And I'm angry with him for it.

422
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:11,503
- Uh, I almost forgot. Something happens. - The entire unit ...

423
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:16,236
I get the conversation about the disorder at the opening ceremony.

424
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:18,368
- Interference or a threat? - Both.

425
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,402
- Case 54. Ordered. - A threat.

426
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:25,315
Perfect. 54, after him. Come on, come on.

427
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:30,251
Vio, I want you back here at 10:30.

428
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:35,386
- Oh, after that? Okay, 10:30. - Done. 10:30.

429
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37,294
Enjoy her movies.

430
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:42,266
In the ninth meeting Ark is, cutter, the ...

431
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:46,533
Everything is given to the loser sleep. Asleep.

432
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,416
What was discussed?

433
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:01,250
We will control the earth.

434
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,447
We can rule the world.

435
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:11,327
That's not the way to calculate it, dad. It's a way to do it.

436
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:14,457
I do not know how it is. Why did they change the math.

437
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,491
- It's okay, dad. - That's not math, it's math.

438
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:18,503
I'll wait for the mother to return.

439
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:23,237
What? He will not know more than me.

440
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:25,368
They called Linus.

441
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:33,478
Everything used, Turbor disturbed. While asleep, simply because they can not pursue.

442
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:42,291
Quasi asleep and snoring. Eyes are very heavy.

443
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:47,392
Surviving, in essence, everyone, everyone sitting in the hay.

444
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:51,232
Everyone was asleep, which they lack.

445
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:55,502
The mayor usually exaggerate about their city, and I'm no exception.

446
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:59,409
And I believe, you feel it.

447
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,469
Are you confident the police would be okay with this?

448
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,471
Of course, that's the easy part.

449
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:06,417
They have not forgiven us have made their lives easier.

450
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:09,251
I know the police chief, it would not be a problem.

451
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:14,385
With all due respect. If you are alone, it would be different.

452
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,293
I'm just saying it.

453
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:21,392
And I must admit, to our incredible launch bullet train.

454
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:26,302
It will take you where you need to go, with extraordinary speed.

455
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:30,297
The future is open officially.

456
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,486
Wait, stop the car.

457
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,396
What?

458
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,263
The carriage drove in the wrong direction.

459
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:00,463
- It drove backwards. - I'm going after him.

460
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:10,475
The train was almost overtaken. 180 and still rising. How quickly created.

461
00:39:11,283 --> 00:39:13,478
About 25 miles.

462
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,293
No one can stop this train and help.

463
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:24,455
It's okay. Do not go.

464
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:28,262
What it Elastigirl?

465
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,435
Caution!

466
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:38,275
- Reset! - They block the system.

467
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:46,507
- We will fail to save. - Not enough time.

468
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:53,256
- Someone call? Who? - Hey, mom, I could not find socks,

469
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:56,284
And he could not find his toys. We'll call you again.

470
00:39:56,295 --> 00:39:58,286
- So, calm down. - Do not call your mother.

471
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:01,265
Allright darling. Can not talk right now. But check under your bed, right?

472
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,461
- How much time? - Approximately 2 minutes.

473
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:07,336
There is a shortcut, cut to the front end.

474
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,373
I do not know if I can catch him.

475
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,473
Come on!

476
00:42:24,443 --> 00:42:26,434
What the hell?

477
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:30,279
Everything is alright? There are people injured? Are you alright?

478
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,345
Nice story better!

479
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:40,381
- Hi? Hi? - What happened?

480
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:48,525
Welcome back, Elastigirl. Rapta-pantallas.

481
00:43:13,492 --> 00:43:18,429
- Honey, why are you? - Do not say anything.

482
00:43:22,234 --> 00:43:25,328
- It's dad. Are you alright? - I am fine.

483
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:29,272
- I do not want to talk about this. - You did not go?

484
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:32,504
- I do not want to talk about it. Father. - Oh dear.

485
00:43:32,544 --> 00:43:38,380
Go away from here, not better. Leave me alone. Please.

486
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:43,420
That's my brother, this burger.

487
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:46,424
I feel you are more mature, Roy.

488
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:49,518
Because you're extraordinary.

489
00:43:52,364 --> 00:43:57,267
Raise your hand, raise your hand. Put your hands behind your head.

490
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:01,363
You too, miss it. And come here.

491
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,241
Note the door.

492
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:06,437
And then I change ...

493
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:11,340
Now.

494
00:44:13,385 --> 00:44:16,354
I'm telling you now.

495
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:18,512
Come on!

496
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:59,223
No, no, no, no, no!

497
00:46:01,293 --> 00:46:03,420
No!

498
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:06,487
No, no!

499
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:12,266
No, no, no! No, no! No, no!

500
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:26,343
You have the power! Yes! Baby, no injuries to you!

501
00:46:26,351 --> 00:46:30,219
I thought you did not have, you have the power.

502
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:35,453
You can multiply and penetrate any hard.

503
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:42,357
Oh, my God.

504
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:49,302
- Hello. - Hi, dear. You'll call me?

505
00:46:49,341 --> 00:46:57,441
I'm fine, do not. I mean, yes, yes. I just ... weird thing just happened in the yard.

506
00:46:57,449 --> 00:47:01,408
- Sounded like he woke. - No, no, it's just, Jack-Jack.

507
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,217
He was in an accident, I know. I'm home now. I know.

508
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:07,383
No, no, no. There are no accidents. Remained there, it is your mission.

509
00:47:07,392 --> 00:47:10,452
And you never, should, should, what? You do not think I could do it?

510
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:13,521
I'm sorry, I was overcharged.

511
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:17,228
- What do you need me to go home? - No, no. No. I was able to.

512
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:20,260
- Everything is fine. - What happened to Jack-Jack.

513
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:25,333
- No, he helps all. - That's good.

514
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:32,316
- What about Violet? Tonight, right? - Oh, yes. Yes. Good.

515
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,309
Everything was good, good. And Jack-Jack to sleep? Without any problems?

516
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,288
Okay, no problem.

517
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:39,483
And Dash finish homework?

518
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:43,358
- Everything is finished. - So it was not out of control when I go?

519
00:47:43,395 --> 00:47:48,230
Exceptional as it looks, it's nice. In fact.

520
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:49,460
How about you?

521
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,436
I think it's incredible all!

522
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:57,406
That's fantastic. The mayor stuck in the car ...

523
00:47:57,442 --> 00:48:00,411
In the opening ceremony, Elastigirl save the mayor ...

524
00:48:00,412 --> 00:48:07,284
Activated, bla-bla-bla ... A few words and then the train began moving backwards,

525
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:10,413
- Then ... - new car crash tragedy ...

526
00:48:10,422 --> 00:48:14,222
For Elastigirl, almost all superheroes.

527
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:16,420
Elastigirl...Elastigirl...

528
00:48:16,428 --> 00:48:19,261
There were no casualties.

529
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:21,391
Using a motor ...

530
00:48:22,534 --> 00:48:26,368
And I pursue it, I tell dear, it was extraordinary.

531
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:30,398
That's unusual, unfortunately. On the first night of yours, dear.

532
00:48:30,442 --> 00:48:35,379
- I'm so proud of you. Very. - I'm proud of you, honey.

533
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:40,316
I know you want to get out there, and you will soon, either. You will be enormous.

534
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:42,479
I could not do it if you do not take very good experts.

535
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:46,321
- Thank you to handle everything. - It is nothing.

536
00:48:46,324 --> 00:48:49,384
I love you, dear. I'll be home soon.

537
00:48:49,394 --> 00:48:52,454
- Sweet dream. - Sweet dreams, dear.

538
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:11,272
Oh, is completed. Please, dad. It is okay.

539
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,251
I'll wait for the mother.

540
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,482
In secret, I know ...

541
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:20,423
I can do the math.

542
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,335
Oh, not good at all.

543
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:40,370
Command weak, am I too weak?

544
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,476
It's not my fault they changed the math.

545
00:49:52,524 --> 00:49:55,288
Get up, baby.

546
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:58,262
I do not like to disturb your sleep.

547
00:49:58,263 --> 00:50:01,426
Do you still want to continue to sleep?

548
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:06,460
You have to remember it all.

549
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:10,400
Calculate the formula correctly.

550
00:50:10,408 --> 00:50:14,469
You understand? You're terrific.

551
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:29,460
Oh. Hello.

552
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:34,329
Where is your house? I wrote a message in your locker.

553
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,356
With permanent ink.

554
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,392
Oh, what's that?

555
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:41,338
- Did you forget? - Forget?

556
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,499
What?

557
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:47,311
That's funny.

558
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:53,407
Very funny. Oh, what for a strange costume?

559
00:50:53,418 --> 00:50:57,252
Because there is, I'm in a hurry ...

560
00:50:57,255 --> 00:51:03,319
and it was like Shakespeare, but not similar. The kids thought it was a super hero costume.

561
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:04,487
- Children love super heroes. - Yes.

562
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:08,295
You want to wear something, but too tight and could not.

563
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:12,531
Do I know you?

564
00:51:19,344 --> 00:51:21,403
The topic of conversation these days is lncredibles.

565
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:25,371
Sorry, I do not really like to talk about it.

566
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:27,442
Maybe they did not.

567
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:29,419
I have not been putting on my face.

568
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:32,287
This is good, I train you on this momentum.

569
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:35,453
Get out and be yourself and answer appropriately.

570
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:38,291
Ms. Elastic Girl, they're ready for you.

571
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:42,232
Hey, folding legs.

572
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:46,370
thanks.

573
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:49,272
- Hurry. - Wait ... wow!

574
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:52,504
You are Elastic Girl! I'm shook hands.

575
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:55,341
Oh, I was so sad when you disappeared.

576
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:57,405
I'm glad you're back!

577
00:51:57,415 --> 00:51:58,473
With a great costume.

578
00:51:58,516 --> 00:52:02,418
- It means a lot to me. - Good luck with your speech.

579
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:07,254
- I hope you're at peace. - Of course. Opponent crime!

580
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:08,350
Okay.

581
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:11,260
Three, two ...

582
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:14,231
For more than 15 years, superheroes in hiding.

583
00:52:14,265 --> 00:52:17,359
Forced to do so, because they lost the support.

584
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:21,395
That may soon change due to the movement to restore superheroes.

585
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:26,399
Here was present heroes who save the train and with a new look.

586
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:28,469
Pahlawan super, Elastic Girl.

587
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,276
- Welcome. - Hello, Jed.

588
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,339
All the attention was focused on you.

589
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,475
Correct. Did you know?

590
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:36,248
Of course.

591
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:39,280
- Hello. - What do I get perhartianmu?

592
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:40,415
Ya, Jed.

593
00:52:40,425 --> 00:52:43,451
Of course, I appeared on your screen.

594
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:46,487
Read the words to say on the other screen.

595
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:51,491
Screens are everywhere and we controlled all of it.

596
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:56,405
And display control myself.

597
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:58,307
Human control screen.

598
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,311
- Hey! - I who control everything.

599
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:04,338
Angry reactions that occur in front of you.

600
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:06,316
- What about him? - The signals are hijacked!

601
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,409
- I'm going to close it. - Do not look at the monitor.

602
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:11,286
I just hijack the signal, they are fine.

603
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:16,420
I'm still at the top, right, Elastic Girl?

604
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:19,487
- Whoa! - Where is the window ...?

605
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,397
There.

606
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:34,335
- What happened? - That Elastic Girl!

607
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:37,371
What is he doing?

608
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:50,383
- What are you doing here? - This place is dangerous. Caution!

609
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:54,456
Follow them on!

610
00:53:56,434 --> 00:54:00,461
Get away from there! I'm going to jump!

611
00:54:08,513 --> 00:54:11,448
Stop it! That Elastic Girl.

612
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:15,215
I'm saving your town, Mom!

613
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:25,452
We are under attack! Protect minister!

614
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:32,358
- Open the door! - That's dangerous!

615
00:54:32,537 --> 00:54:36,405
You all, jump!

616
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:56,258
Caution!

617
00:54:57,261 --> 00:55:00,355
We're going to fall!

618
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,267
Are you okay, Mom?

619
00:55:09,273 --> 00:55:12,265
I am alright...

620
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:23,419
Yours is not tasty cakes.

621
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:26,481
- Good morning. - You saw me in that costume ...

622
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:30,426
and pretend to know me.

623
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:33,294
I was just trying to protect you.

624
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:35,390
She really see you there.

625
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:42,305
That's up to you, I can not tell how many memories I have.

626
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:46,401
Someone knows the identity of your mother and me.

627
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:49,470
I see you! Did you tell them about Tony!

628
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:55,281
- Dear. - You're ruining my life!

629
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:08,364
I hate super hero!

630
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:13,360
And I'm not going to wear it again!

631
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:20,342
I'll tear it up!

632
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:30,479
What can I learn math?

633
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:34,321
It seems that yesterday's incident was terrible ... '' Elastic Girl save the minister. ''

634
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:37,294
there has been a strike yesterday to the minister.

635
00:56:37,328 --> 00:56:39,353
What's up now? Why abounded.

636
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:41,331
They came to offer support.

637
00:56:41,332 --> 00:56:44,199
Support? Support for what?

638
00:56:44,268 --> 00:56:48,432
Support to you.

639
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:51,374
Come on out, we all support you!

640
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:54,276
Hello! Is.

641
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:56,473
Oh, thank you very much.

642
00:56:56,514 --> 00:57:03,283
Hello. What is written there?

643
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,285
Oh, I see you! Ellen Wood.

644
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:14,355
Oh, now you're returning my calls about superheroes?

645
00:57:14,365 --> 00:57:17,357
Oh, I have to call you back. My God, you're great.

646
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:18,493
Hold all the phone for me.

647
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:20,470
Hey! It worked!

648
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:24,271
Hey, ministers make great speeches about super heroes today.

649
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:26,368
You saved a lot of lives and she is very happy.

650
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,436
Who would expect it? I got a lot of calls.

651
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:32,348
Increased media attention 720/0

652
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:36,343
The urge to legalize the super hero into a global movement!

653
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:38,355
I had big plans for the next.

654
00:57:38,356 --> 00:57:40,256
We will hold a press conference at sea.

655
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:44,421
We will use the ship and sail the sea while ...

656
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:47,329
It's true. I'm happy.

657
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:51,461
I'm happy to have saved the lives of people and the minister proud of me.

658
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:53,436
And I'm glad you're happy.

659
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:56,463
I heard that you were happy, but why I do not feel like it?

660
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:59,443
Because I did not catch it. He's still out there.

661
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:02,469
All I did was follow the game and win in this round.

662
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:06,381
He will want it again and when he plays, he always wins!

663
00:58:06,384 --> 00:58:10,252
One thing I learned in business that is sniffing flowers.

664
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:13,256
Everything is in bloom and where would you put on a stone nisanmu?

665
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,258
- He's too worried? - OK.

666
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:19,491
Stop talking. Show him.

667
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:29,500
Wow.

668
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:33,271
Wow! Elastic Girl. You are here.

669
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:35,404
- Hello. - I do not know what ... wow!

00:58:35,413 --> 00:58:38,348
Come on, you can do it.

I bring it here, they are hiding.

681
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:21,257
Their strength, the secret identity, all transferred.

682
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:26,457
A pleasure to meet. I always thought the greatest.

683
00:59:26,464 --> 00:59:28,455
Well, thank cation. You are so kind.

684
00:59:28,499 --> 00:59:32,401

You know, dropping objects electricity.

688
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:43,404
Assemble and unleash the power of lightning.

689
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:48,350
I Reflux. I can be anything you decide.

690
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:51,321
I know you're very excited.

691
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:53,414
- Just say it. - Oh, I'm not busy.

692
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:56,393
Forget it.

693
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:03,331
Yes, it was amazing. Come back.

694
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:06,269
So...

695
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:11,238
Well, congratulations on this great day.

696
01:00:11,242 --> 01:00:14,507
Good night all. See you tomorrow.

697
01:00:14,545 --> 01:00:16,342

698
01:00:16,347 --> 01:00:19,316
- You're wearing the pants in this time? - Of course.

699
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:22,376
Well, it's been a while since you did ...

700
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:25,445
and even then you are under its shadow.

701
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:27,219
Yes, I feel differently.

702
01:00:27,258 --> 01:00:31,285
I did not mean it. You're very successful and you're the star.

703
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:36,391
But you have to talk about it. This is your house.

704
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,426
- You need to fix your attitude. - What are you doing?

705
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:42,439
- You're not better. - I do not want his work.

706
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:45,465
I can not do that to you.

707
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:48,411
I'm asking you, the rooms where the most intense?

708
01:00:48,445 --> 01:00:51,414
You never entered, it must be clean.

709
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:52,415
Beautiful scenery?

710
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:56,510
That will affect turnover as more and more buyers.

711
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,354
Whatever you are selling nothing. Who penging what people buy?

712
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:04,259
It's true. If I find the origin of the universe.

713
01:01:04,295 --> 01:01:08,527
My sister will look for ways to approach it. Perhaps with foot massage.

714
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:12,428
So, what do they say?

715
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:15,404
They will tell you to get ready.

716
01:01:15,406 --> 01:01:19,342
They will wait for permission and the preceding first.

717
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:20,503
- Looks like it was my brother. - What?

718
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:22,307
You sound like my brother.

719
01:01:22,313 --> 01:01:26,249
Well, he's not wrong. We're not going to get a reaction.

720
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,410
- I know how! - My older brother?

721
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:29,510
What? Not! The movement!

722
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,422
Send him a message and I'll try to track it.

723
01:01:33,457 --> 01:01:36,255
How fast can you get to the airport?

724
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,251
- OK. - We should get out of this town.

725
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:40,321
I will be prepared tomorrow morning at 5.

726
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:42,229
Insert it into the television. Jed!

727
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:44,325
I will make my brother do a live broadcast tomorrow ...

728
01:01:44,335 --> 01:01:45,302
with a news event!

729
01:01:45,336 --> 01:01:47,304
- We'll trap her! - He will not tell!

730
01:01:47,338 --> 01:01:48,532
Movement of the hero will succeed!

731
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:53,272
Tonight!

732
01:01:55,346 --> 01:01:56,404
- Who is this? - Yeah, hey Rick.

733
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:59,348
Do you remember the child who never told you?

734
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:01,317
Yes, what is up? He's a good kid.

735
01:02:01,352 --> 01:02:05,254
Well, he also deals with my daughter.

736
01:02:05,256 --> 01:02:07,315
Actually you harm my daughter.

737
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:09,451
Oh, shit. I did not know about that.

738
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:11,393
Rick, you have to help.

739
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:14,454
Violet hates me, you and superheroes.

740
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:18,458
I have to fix this. What do you know about Tony?

741
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:21,471
Not much. Looks like he's a good kid.

742
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:25,499
She loves music and sports. His parents happy.

743
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:27,477
These children work part-time.

744
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:31,504
Of Happy Platter?

745
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:37,250
Why are we the way here and eat at Happy Platter?

746
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,448
We would like to reserve a table is there.

747
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:44,257
Near the plant. Nice is not, close the plant.

748
01:02:45,296 --> 01:02:48,265
This place does not look so fun.

749
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,358
The place is rather dull.

750
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:52,266
Boring.

751
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:55,329
I thought you wanted to change our course.

752
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:59,308
- I like the food was outstanding. - That's not good.

753
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:03,440
That all diet foods and all vegetables.

754
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,506
Good evening, everybody.

755
01:03:06,517 --> 01:03:09,384
- What is wrong with you? - Do not you anything?

756
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:13,447
- Let me help you ... - He was surprised.

757
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:17,256
Normally she was never like that.

758
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,319
- Do you want water, sir? - Yes.

759
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:23,357
A glass of water. This is my daughter, you know him?

760
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,492
- Halo.- Violet.

761
01:03:24,535 --> 01:03:27,368
Halo, Violet.

762
01:03:27,371 --> 01:03:28,497
Hey, say hi to the ...

763
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:32,236
- Do not be too pushy, father. - How are you?

764
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:34,210
Halo.

765
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:37,236
This drink is delicious.

766
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:40,512
- Water What is this? - I do not know, the tap water.

767
01:03:40,551 --> 01:03:45,420
- Very delicious. - Extraordinary.

768
01:03:46,457 --> 01:03:48,288
Nice to meet you.

769
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:49,452
Where is he going?

770
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:52,452
Finding a place to go berserk?

771
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:56,488
Hi, we will conduct a special interview with Elastic Girl.

772
01:03:56,533 --> 01:03:59,297
How are you, Jed? Do not you anything?

773
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:01,396
I am fine. Doctors have examined me.

774
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,497
I do not remember what happened.

775
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:07,500
I must tell you, strange to experience the event.

776
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:09,479
I do not remember.

777
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:13,506
I ask that everyone not to worry.

778
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:14,484
Where are you now?

779
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:18,249
I was in a cave that is very safe.

780
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:22,349
I want to talk to you, starting with a rescue train recording.

781
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:27,490
This is the original footage of the action beranimu.

782
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:33,231
We have to save him before the train crashed!

783
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:36,239
25 miles away. Guavaberry

784
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:41,337
I will do an important announcement at this event.

785
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:44,245
- He knows. - The mechanism worked.

786
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:47,250
- No need to look for the source. - Gotcha!

787
01:04:47,251 --> 01:04:53,247
You will not be able to find it. I could not be found.

788
01:04:53,257 --> 01:05:01,221
And when you are aware, I've been in a place far away.

789
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:07,397
Superheroes are creatures who must be destroyed.

790
01:05:07,438 --> 01:05:14,276
They do not show their real face.

791
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:17,474
They're just pretending to be a hero,

792
01:05:17,481 --> 01:05:23,442
every action they do to deceive you.

793
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:33,453
All their crimes hidden behind their masks.

794
01:05:33,464 --> 01:05:37,491
As the disease in the human body.

795
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:44,430
You think they protect you, in fact you have been made weak.

796
01:05:44,475 --> 01:05:48,241
I tell this so their cover blown.

797
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:53,342
And everything can be saved from their deceit.

798
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:59,379
The existing system has made a big mistake.

799
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:07,353
Destroy all of the existing system and try to stop me.

800
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:14,236
You're no longer in control. I who control everything.

801
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:57,499
I see you.

802
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:48,382
Sorry!

803
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:20,413
What happened?

804
01:09:20,457 --> 01:09:23,517
You ruined my proof!

805
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:25,495
What is this? What do I do?

806
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:30,432
- You can not do this! - Right, just blame the system!

807
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:33,368
Jebakanmu succeed, you're a genius.

808
01:09:33,403 --> 01:09:37,362
Oh, come on. I'm just a genius behind the genius.

809
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:39,239
The latest news today ...

810
01:09:39,276 --> 01:09:44,270
Dad, what we will do this formula?

811
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:45,213
Come ask me.

812
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:47,375
Do not you ... Are not you tired?

813
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:54,222
Now we have to learn more.

814
01:09:54,257 --> 01:09:59,320
A car driven by a super hero.

815
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:02,331
I bought it when the auction.

816
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:03,526
They said the car was destroyed.

817
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,501
Hey, the car in good condition.

818
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:07,436
You used to have that car?

819
01:10:07,471 --> 01:10:09,336
They said the car was destroyed.

820
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:13,274
This famous car will be auctioned.

821
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:17,474
That is ... That's my car!

822
01:10:27,257 --> 01:10:30,283
You're going to fill it with advanced equipment.

823
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:32,318
- Is it true? - I like this car.

824
01:10:32,362 --> 01:10:36,264
But it will take a long time.

825
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:40,335
Wow! His car is on fire!

826
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:42,296
Hah?

827
01:10:42,305 --> 01:10:44,466
What are you doing? It's not a toy!

828
01:10:44,474 --> 01:10:46,339
That is the rocket launcher!

829
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:48,276
Wait, we have to launch a rocket.

830
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:49,471
Hey, it's not your car.

831
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:51,242
It's also not a car.

832
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:52,476
That's my car. That's mine.

833
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:54,347
Why is that person who has it?

834
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:56,409
- He does not have it. - Launch a rocket.

835
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:57,408
Launch rocket!

836
01:10:57,454 --> 01:10:59,285
We're not going to launch anything.

837
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:04,350
Do you think I want them to come to me now, when I try to not ...

838
01:11:04,361 --> 01:11:06,522
distract.

839
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:12,335
Shit.

840
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:18,435
So you're not going to steal your car back?

841
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:33,483
Jack-Jack has the power?

842
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,481
- Correct. - You know about this?

843
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:37,459
- Yes. - Why did not you tell us?

844
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,486
- I know. - We are your children. We are entitled to know.

845
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,259
- You tell mom? - No.

846
01:11:42,265 --> 01:11:45,291
- Why not? - Your mother was not happy to hear it.

847
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:47,361
Why are we not going to tell her?

848
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:48,337
- What? - Because, it can not.

849
01:11:48,371 --> 01:11:49,463
- Come on, man. - Why?

850
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,372
- Because ... - Really not cool.

851
01:11:51,408 --> 01:11:53,501
Because I'm thinking about it. Okay?

852
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:56,444
I accepted the information and are currently processing it.

853
01:11:56,446 --> 01:12:01,383
I tried to fix it and try to prevent the baby into a flaming monster.

854
01:12:01,384 --> 01:12:03,409
How do I do that?

855
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:08,390
By accepting all the mischief, okay?

856
01:12:08,425 --> 01:12:13,488
Because I'm Mr. lncredible, not Mr. Soap, or Mr. Milk.

857
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:17,455
Mr. lncredible.

858
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:20,301
Gosh.

859
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:25,365
No, I can handle it. There's no way I'm going to ...

860
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:39,352
I will contact Lucius.

861
01:12:41,391 --> 01:12:44,224
Look normal to me. Since when did this happen?

862
01:12:44,261 --> 01:12:46,229
Since Helen got the job.

863
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:47,218
I assume he knows it.

864
01:12:47,264 --> 01:12:49,323
Are you kidding? I could not tell him about this.

865
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:51,231
Not as long as he did the work of heroes.

866
01:12:51,268 --> 01:12:54,533
LBU.

867
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:59,467
I must succeed so that he could succeed.

868
01:12:59,509 --> 01:13:01,409
For us to succeed.

869
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:03,470
I understand, Bob. I understand.

870
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,277
When was the last time you slept?

871
01:13:05,315 --> 01:13:10,480
No need to be exaggerated. I can handle this.

872
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,249
So...

873
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:13,279
then you okay?

874
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:16,418
You can overcome this situation, is not it?

875
01:13:18,328 --> 01:13:20,262
What ...

876
01:13:20,263 --> 01:13:22,493
Okay, time for cake.

877
01:13:22,532 --> 01:13:27,333
Delicious cake.

878
01:13:27,337 --> 01:13:28,429
Cake.

879
01:13:28,438 --> 01:13:32,465
- You can not ... - Cake ...

880
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:36,436
He had just ...

881
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:39,243
Coming from another dimension. Correct.

882
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:40,511
It was really creepy. And it was not ...

883
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:44,350
Not good. I know.

884
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:46,481
Power will increase. And we can not control it.

885
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:49,253
So, what ... what do you succeed?

886
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:51,317
Yes. You think so, do not you?

887
01:13:51,328 --> 01:13:55,264
Obviously, I can not keep giving her cakes.

888
01:13:55,298 --> 01:13:57,528
But if I stop ...

889
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:06,299
I can not bite. I can not bite.

890
01:14:11,348 --> 01:14:13,339
All right.

891
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:17,286
I think I need time for myself.

892
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,378
Then I'll be able to finish this.

893
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:20,514
You need more than just that, Bob.

894
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:26,393
You need plenty of time to finish this. Starting from this weird super baby.

895
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:31,457
You need to start thinking about something unusual.

896
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:45,270
You dare to appear in front of me like that without cleaning it first?

897
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:47,476
Clean yourself.

898
01:14:49,452 --> 01:14:52,319
Bob, are you bringing anyone?

899
01:14:52,322 --> 01:14:53,448
Only the baby alone.

900
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:57,221
I took my baby.

901
01:14:57,293 --> 01:15:00,353
Really unusual.

902
01:15:06,403 --> 01:15:09,497
You look absolutely terrible.

903
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,271
I ruined my car.

904
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:20,340
Then he hit me, and now he's changing.

905
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:24,411
I do not know what else to do.

906
01:15:24,454 --> 01:15:25,512
I'm really tired.

907
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:29,458
If done correctly, being a parent is a heroic act.

908
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:31,357
If done properly.

909
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:34,421
And fortunately, you know me.

910
01:15:34,464 --> 01:15:38,423
If you do not come to me, then you will be destroyed.

911
01:15:38,435 --> 01:15:43,270
I've been designing clothes the hero, for your son.

912
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:45,365
Actually it was for Jack-Jack.

913
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:48,242
You also want me to make clothes for the baby?

914
01:15:48,278 --> 01:15:51,475
I would not regard this as one of the emergency.

915
01:15:51,481 --> 01:15:57,249
Well, you'll never know until I left it here for a while.

916
01:15:57,287 --> 01:16:00,347
Leave it? Here?

917
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:05,293
I'm not a babysitter. I'm an artist.

918
01:16:05,328 --> 01:16:09,458
I'm good at making clothes.

919
01:16:17,507 --> 01:16:21,341
Did you see this?

920
01:16:33,323 --> 01:16:35,450
Gosh.

921
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:37,323
Ya.

922
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:44,323
Glad you came to this heavy task, because I like to challenge myself.

923
01:16:44,334 --> 01:16:49,499
And I'll take care of it properly, so you will see the changes later.

924
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:54,467
Edna become parents?

925
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,347
Attention, attention.

926
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:02,443
I want to thank all the people who have come here tonight ...

927
01:17:02,485 --> 01:17:07,479
in order to support these heroes and encourage them to return to society.

928
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:09,321
You who make all of this happen.

929
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:18,427
While I only intercede you desire to achieve this.

930
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:21,301
I think of him as someone special.

931
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:23,305
You love it, you miss him.

932
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:27,242
Meet Elastigirl.

933
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,299
Go on up here.

934
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:32,338
Better yet, show yourself here.

935
01:17:32,348 --> 01:17:35,283
I want you to have this.

936
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:36,478
A keepsake.

937
01:17:36,519 --> 01:17:40,387
Thank you, Winston, Evelyn, and all the people who are here.

938
01:17:40,423 --> 01:17:42,357
I'm flattered.

939
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:47,318
And to all of you. It's thanks to you guys.

940
01:17:47,363 --> 01:17:53,233
We only had a short time, which makes me want to announce something important.

941
01:17:53,269 --> 01:18:00,471
Just now, the World Meeting led by hundreds of world leaders agreeing to be a hero ...

942
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:03,377
reappear.

943
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:12,346
Look, all leaders on this earth are to hold a meeting on the ship.

944
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:17,383
If you permit, we would attend.

945
01:18:21,397 --> 01:18:23,422
As ...

946
01:18:23,466 --> 01:18:27,266
There is something to ask of you first.

947
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:31,502
How can you split time between being a hero and an ordinary person?

948
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,340
Oh, could you briefly delay?

949
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:44,218
Yes, see you again.

950
01:19:04,274 --> 01:19:07,368
- Hey, baby. - Hey.

951
01:19:07,377 --> 01:19:10,278
- Where is Jack-Jack? - He's staying at home ...

952
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,339
- Edna become a nanny? - True.

953
01:19:12,382 --> 01:19:14,475
And you do not object to this?

954
01:19:14,484 --> 01:19:18,318
Yes. I do not mind.

955
01:19:19,322 --> 01:19:22,485
I want to tell you something.

956
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:25,420
Sorry about Tommy.

957
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:30,364
I do not think to erase his memory, you will pay the consequence ...

958
01:19:30,366 --> 01:19:34,302
of choices you never do. That's not fair.

959
01:19:34,337 --> 01:19:36,237
I know.

960
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,367
And then I made it worse in the restaurant with trying to ...

961
01:19:39,409 --> 01:19:41,377
Whatever it is, whatever it is ...

962
01:19:41,411 --> 01:19:43,345
Forgive me.

963
01:19:43,346 --> 01:19:46,440
I always knew what the right thing to do.

964
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:50,213
But now, I'm not sure anymore.

965
01:19:50,253 --> 01:19:53,347
I just want to be ...

966
01:19:54,324 --> 01:19:56,485
a good father.

967
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:02,488
You're not a good father.

968
01:20:03,466 --> 01:20:06,367
You're a super dad.

969
01:20:15,278 --> 01:20:17,473
What heroes are allowed to drink while on duty?

970
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,449
I'm not on duty. Just ignore this costume.

971
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:25,353
I knew I should be up there, but I do not really like crowds.

972
01:20:25,388 --> 01:20:28,448
You must be alone to keep the spirit. I know I am.

973
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:30,323
You're running from?

974
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,351
Well, you know, a problem the company.

975
01:20:32,362 --> 01:20:33,386
But mostly my brother.

976
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:36,489
But you love him. You guys are the motor of this company. Yin and Yang.

977
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:39,366
Correct. I know it. He was great with communication.

978
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:43,463
Make them happy, welcome them, listen to what they want.

979
01:20:43,473 --> 01:20:46,203
I never know what people want.

980
01:20:46,242 --> 01:20:48,267
What do you want them?

981
01:20:48,311 --> 01:20:52,338
Ease. People will redeem quality with ease, every time.

982
01:20:52,382 --> 01:20:55,374
That might not be bad, but hey, it's easy.

983
01:20:55,385 --> 01:20:57,285
I have no idea.

984
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:00,346
- You got a problem? - Yes, there is something.

985
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,221
That's too easy.

986
01:21:02,258 --> 01:21:05,284
It's too easy?

987
01:21:05,395 --> 01:21:06,521
- Anything?

988
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:08,497
What is that?

989
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:14,333
One monitor that it is a camera flashes.

990
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:17,363
Is not closed bersirkuit camera?

991
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:20,433
- Correct. - If so, how do they have it?

992
01:21:20,476 --> 01:21:22,341
Maybe they meretasnya.

993
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:27,441
So security is really sophisticated, but the door was only locked simple?

994
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:29,418
Maybe he wants you to know.

995
01:21:29,452 --> 01:21:31,283
He wants to get caught?

996
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,380
- He wants you to win. - That's absurd.

997
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:38,383
He's an intelligent man. There was no way he was not aware of such technology.

998
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:41,329
He's smart enough to do something with it.

999
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:43,298
People that we put people in jail is not arbitrary.

1000
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:45,425
So? I see him as a loser

1001
01:21:45,435 --> 01:21:48,233
Look, you win. You've got ...

1002
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:49,238
Wait!

1003
01:21:49,272 --> 01:21:51,467
He must do to hypnotize someone

1004
01:21:51,474 --> 01:21:54,238
is to make their eyes fixed on the screen.

1005
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:59,305
But what if the screen did not look like a screen?

1006
01:22:00,383 --> 01:22:01,350
What if...

1007
01:22:01,384 --> 01:22:09,257
He only person controlled by a person who is behind the scenes?

1008
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,453
You are right.

1009
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:29,506
I say let you sleep is a good thing.

1010
01:22:29,512 --> 01:22:32,413
Over the past 17 hours.

1011
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:35,281
How do you feel?

1012
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:37,377
Super.

1013
01:22:39,422 --> 01:22:43,415
I can not express how much I mernghargai Jack-Jack you cared for me, E.

1014
01:22:43,426 --> 01:22:46,395
Yes, I believe gratitude is very able to accept.

1015
01:22:46,429 --> 01:22:50,456
Do not ever ask me to do it again, my schedule is really solid.

1016
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:57,372
I am kidding. I'm happy with it. I love your son.

1017
01:22:57,373 --> 01:23:02,310
Most of thy evil. As babies in general, he has unlimited potential.

1018
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:08,375
As you know, this young man has so much expertise.

1019
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:13,218
They, dear?

1020
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:28,529
I understand the lack of sleep you can not judge something well.

1021
01:23:28,538 --> 01:23:32,372
That could be anything. And your son is the same.

1022
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:35,276
Really has unlimited power potential.

1023
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:39,304
I've made something for him.

1024
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:45,454
You put him in ...

1025
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:50,255
In a special room. Look what happened. And all would be fine.

1026
01:23:50,293 --> 01:23:58,359
- your challenge is to make the baby can control his power. - More or less.

1027
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:02,428
I've worked in the field of music, and I know the baby responded to it well.

1028
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:05,372
Mainly Mozart.

1029
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:10,471
I make a special outfit for her.

1030
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:17,317
And with this tablet you can monitor your baby.

1031
01:24:17,353 --> 01:24:20,322
Jeez ... what did he do?

1032
01:24:20,356 --> 01:24:27,455
Well, this is Mozart. Just accept it. The important thing you can monitor and anticipate changes.

1033
01:24:27,463 --> 01:24:30,398
Oh no. I had to take the cake.

1034
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:40,468
Needless cake. I learned overnight. If he did not get a cake he would turn out to be evil.

1035
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:45,245
Threatening danger. What does it mean?

1036
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:55,316
This means that fire. I suggest you put out the fire.

1037
01:24:56,392 --> 01:25:00,260
And the use of other foods to disable it.

1038
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:04,323
Delicious and can be eaten.

1039
01:25:04,467 --> 01:25:06,264
That's helpful.

1040
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:10,500
Although I have to admit this is the greatest accomplishments overnight.

1041
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:14,441
The tool has many functions we need to talk.

1042
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:17,241
Thanks again, E. For everything.

1043
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,405
How much do I owe you?

1044
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:26,378
Stop basimu ado. The pay is that I will be forever on the family's clothes designer

1045
01:25:26,389 --> 01:25:34,489
until the end of time. But being a baby sitter, I do it for free.

1046
01:25:51,414 --> 01:25:54,281
I already know taunting to extend your hand.

1047
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:57,376
Temperatures around here a little bit cold.

1048
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:00,253
Try to lengthen your arms, you will be destroyed.

1049
01:26:00,256 --> 01:26:02,383
So you're Screenslaver?

1050
01:26:02,425 --> 01:26:05,292
True. And it's not.

1051
01:26:05,294 --> 01:26:09,424
Just tell me who created it. And spreading his message.

1052
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:10,489
What Winston knows?

1053
01:26:10,533 --> 01:26:14,230
That I'm the Screenslaver? Certainly not.

1054
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:18,366
Can you imagine what they would do with technology hipnotisku?

1055
01:26:18,374 --> 01:26:19,500
Worship what you do.

1056
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:24,343
Hey, I'm using the technology to destroy the confidence of people.

1057
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:26,337
As I take advantage of a super hero.

1058
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:28,213
Who I was put into prison?

1059
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:33,278
Only a courier. Useless. Aimless life.

1060
01:26:33,322 --> 01:26:37,258
I must say I give you a good role.

1061
01:26:37,259 --> 01:26:39,454
What does not make you disturbed an innocent man go to jail because of you?

1062
01:26:39,462 --> 01:26:41,430
He's a fool.

1063
01:26:41,464 --> 01:26:43,227
And he is stiff.

1064
01:26:43,265 --> 01:26:44,493
I trust you.

1065
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,365
That is where you failed.

1066
01:26:46,402 --> 01:26:49,269
- What? - Why do you believe me?

1067
01:26:49,271 --> 01:26:50,499
Because I lend you bike?

1068
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:54,270
Since my sister made a theme song for you?

1069
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:55,436
We do not know each other.

1070
01:26:55,444 --> 01:26:57,378
But you can trust me.

1071
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:02,510
It should be, is not it? Because you have the strength, and lavish costumes.

1072
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:07,352
And we have to rely on and trust.

1073
01:27:07,356 --> 01:27:09,517
That's what my father believed.

1074
01:27:09,525 --> 01:27:12,221
When our house was robbed.

1075
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:16,288
My mother wanted to hide. He begged my father to open the hidden room.

1076
01:27:16,332 --> 01:27:20,428
But my father insisted to call a friend of his hero.

1077
01:27:20,436 --> 01:27:23,371
He's dead. By useless.

1078
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:25,373
Foolishly.

1079
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:28,240
Waiting for the hero to save us.

1080
01:27:28,244 --> 01:27:29,438
But why ... your sister ...

1081
01:27:29,478 --> 01:27:31,469
He was a child.

1082
01:27:31,514 --> 01:27:35,473
He remembers the days in which we have a hero.

1083
01:27:35,484 --> 01:27:39,386
So, like a child, Winston still stupid.

1084
01:27:39,388 --> 01:27:43,324
Mom and Dad ran for the heroes escape.

1085
01:27:43,325 --> 01:27:47,455
And we have to surrender to hang our fate in the hands of others.

1086
01:27:47,496 --> 01:27:50,488
Heroes make us weak.

1087
01:27:50,499 --> 01:27:53,263
What are you going to kill me?

1088
01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:55,396
No.

1089
01:27:56,305 --> 01:27:57,465
Using you still better.

1090
01:27:57,506 --> 01:28:03,467
You're going to help to make it illegal hero forever.

1091
01:28:10,252 --> 01:28:10,513
Ready?

1092
01:28:10,519 --> 01:28:13,283
Mata laser.

1093
01:28:13,322 --> 01:28:15,313
Stop.

1094
01:28:16,358 --> 01:28:18,326
That's not how. Look at this.

1095
01:28:18,327 --> 01:28:21,387
Jack-Jack, are you ready?

1096
01:28:30,339 --> 01:28:33,365
Do not make this baby shot in the house. Do you understand?

1097
01:28:33,409 --> 01:28:36,242
It is interesting.

1098
01:28:36,245 --> 01:28:39,271
We're going to teach him how to control his power. Okay?

1099
01:28:39,281 --> 01:28:42,250
Display screen.

1100
01:28:42,451 --> 01:28:43,440
He disappeares.

1101
01:28:43,452 --> 01:28:45,317
That's really cool.

1102
01:28:45,321 --> 01:28:48,518
All right, good. Use it. Use. Press.

1103
01:28:48,524 --> 01:28:56,260
You see the radar, its shape. That office. Use it to track him down, so where is he?

1104
01:28:56,465 --> 01:28:58,365
There.

1105
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:02,336
OK. Exit. Time for cake.

1106
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:06,408
- Jack-Jack. - Keren.

1107
01:29:12,414 --> 01:29:14,382
- Hello? - Elastigirl in trouble.

1108
01:29:14,416 --> 01:29:15,508
What? What happened to him?

1109
01:29:15,551 --> 01:29:19,248
Sorry, to tell you over the phone. Meet me on the plane Devtech.

1110
01:29:19,255 --> 01:29:23,214
Devtech plane. I would arrive in 15 minutes.

1111
01:29:23,425 --> 01:29:27,225
Lucius. Bob. Helen in trouble. I need someone to look after the children.

1112
01:29:27,229 --> 01:29:32,257
- Wear your costume. It would be strange. - I'll get there. 15 minutes.

1113
01:29:35,304 --> 01:29:38,239
I have to go. I'll be home soon. Lucius will arrive here.

1114
01:29:38,274 --> 01:29:40,333
Do not make him shoot in the house. Okay?

1115
01:29:40,342 --> 01:29:45,473
What happened with the plane in Devtech? And why are you wearing your super?

1116
01:29:56,425 --> 01:29:58,256
What is a super mom clothes?

1117
01:29:58,294 --> 01:30:00,262
He may need it. You never know.

1118
01:30:00,296 --> 01:30:01,456
What happened?

1119
01:30:01,463 --> 01:30:06,526
I do not know. But Father Lucius after getting the phone call about the mother and then go

1120
01:30:06,535 --> 01:30:08,503
I thought you did not like to be a superhero.

1121
01:30:08,504 --> 01:30:14,374
Yes, but I have to help my family. Wear.

1122
01:30:24,386 --> 01:30:28,345
Hello, little friend.

1123
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:30,255
You are not safe.

1124
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:31,283
Deborah sent us to take you.

1125
01:30:31,327 --> 01:30:38,392
Well, the father had just told me to keep them.

1126
01:30:39,368 --> 01:30:41,495
Because these children are safe.

1127
01:30:41,537 --> 01:30:44,233
I understand, it is sometimes confusing.

1128
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:47,231
Go. You understand, right, Miss ...

1129
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:48,334

1130
01:30:48,377 --> 01:30:51,346
Ninth Voyd.

1131
01:30:51,347 --> 01:30:53,440
Good night.

1132
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:06,250
Happily, he asked us to take you too.

1133
01:31:06,261 --> 01:31:08,422
As ...

1134
01:31:08,464 --> 01:31:11,262
That will not hold them for long.

1135
01:31:11,266 --> 01:31:13,461
Quick save yourselves.

1136
01:31:15,471 --> 01:31:17,530
Come on!

1137
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:25,312
To my car!

1138
01:31:33,422 --> 01:31:37,358
Vi, what happened?

1139
01:31:55,477 --> 01:31:58,446
It works.

01:32:02,451 --> 01:32:06,251
lncredibile open the door.

1141
01:32:06,255 --> 01:32:08,519
Step into.

1142
01:32:13,429 --> 01:32:17,456
Turn on the navigation system.

1143
01:32:17,466 --> 01:32:21,493
- Frog fire. - Jack Rubber.

1144
01:32:24,506 --> 01:32:27,202
No.

1145
01:32:27,242 --> 01:32:30,268
We must flee.

1146
01:32:37,286 --> 01:32:38,514
- What news? - Good news and bad news.

1147
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:46,450
We find him, physically well but she was not aware of.

1148
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:51,431
Strange house.

1149
01:32:58,373 --> 01:33:00,341
Helen.

1150
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:03,310
Helen, what are you ...

1151
01:33:10,419 --> 01:33:13,479

lncredibile spinning.

1153
01:33:36,478 --> 01:33:42,508
We could not go, they all wear glasses.

1154
01:33:42,518 --> 01:33:45,419
They are under the influence of a person.

1155
01:33:45,454 --> 01:33:49,447
But how can we restore them?

1156
01:33:49,491 --> 01:34:00,231
Okay, the man was eyeing us, but with our power, this car ...

1157
01:34:02,237 --> 01:34:04,296
Quiet.

1158
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:19,243
lncredibile continue the journey.

1159
01:34:21,356 --> 01:34:25,258
The boy fled but we caught Bob Parr.

1160
01:34:25,294 --> 01:34:29,230
Take him to the ship immediately.

1161
01:34:34,269 --> 01:34:35,395

He does what I say.

1166
01:35:05,467 --> 01:35:08,493
- We did not plan this, Ralph. - What do you mean? We are here, right?

1167
01:35:08,503 --> 01:35:14,373
Yes, we are here. We should be up there.

1168
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:20,246
Okay, the ejection seat lncredibile.

1169
01:35:20,249 --> 01:35:22,240

01:35:22,284 --> 01:35:25,447
- Do not! - We go.

1171
01:35:32,261 --> 01:35:34,422
Come on.

1172
01:35:36,331 --> 01:35:41,234
Hello, glad you could come. Welcome aboard.

1173
01:35:50,345 --> 01:35:55,373
- Where's our star, the show was about to begin. - He can not appear.

1174
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:58,250
He will join another time.

1175
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:00,414
The attention of the audience.

1176
01:36:00,422 --> 01:36:04,415
This ship is the largest ship on the planet.

1177
01:36:04,459 --> 01:36:10,261
So, hold onto something because we will be moving quickly.

1178
01:36:27,349 --> 01:36:30,512
We must look for mom and dad. Stay here, I'll look for them.

1179
01:36:30,519 --> 01:36:33,454
Wait, who will oversee the back here?

1180
01:36:33,455 --> 01:36:35,480
Face it, I will not be long.

1181
01:36:35,524 --> 01:36:38,357
Wait! Wait!

1182
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:42,456
This is important, they are in trouble, his fate is in our hands.

1183
01:36:42,497 --> 01:36:44,260
Understand?

1184
01:36:44,266 --> 01:36:48,293
Make her laugh but do not be noisy.

1185
01:37:07,289 --> 01:37:09,450
Jack-Jack.

1186
01:37:17,532 --> 01:37:21,332
Jack-Jack.

1187
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:56,269
- Jack-Jack. - They know we are here.

1188
01:37:56,304 --> 01:37:58,499
I found my father and mother ... Where is Jack-Jack?

1189
01:37:58,507 --> 01:38:02,307
What? Your job is only one.

1190
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:05,302
Tracker. Use the tracer.

1191
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:10,279
- He's up? - Is he moving?

1192
01:38:10,285 --> 01:38:12,310
Let's go.

1193
01:38:13,355 --> 01:38:17,314
Hey, little baby. You are very...

1194
01:38:18,326 --> 01:38:23,354
And here's their ... our super hero.

1195
01:38:23,365 --> 01:38:25,424
I told you they would be fine.

1196
01:38:25,434 --> 01:38:27,459
Hey, what do you make new glasses?

1197
01:38:27,502 --> 01:38:31,233
Yes, fashionable, good, right?

1198
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:34,470
Simple and all can wear ... and we are airborne in ...

1199
01:38:34,509 --> 01:38:37,273
3, 2, 1.

1200
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:44,310
This is a historical moment, we will all soon witness a very rare thing.

1201
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:48,255
We agree with the outside world.

1202
01:38:48,457 --> 01:38:52,257
We agree to correct bad decisions

1203
01:38:52,294 --> 01:38:55,286

so that they are beneficial to the world.

1206
01:39:02,471 --> 01:39:07,306
You all represent a commitment to superheroes.

1207
01:39:07,309 --> 01:39:09,402
Ambassador Salomon.

1208
01:39:09,444 --> 01:39:11,503
Yes, the harder she can not hear you.

1209
01:39:11,513 --> 01:39:13,504
- Thank you very much. - Thanks ambassador

1210

to support krusialmu.

1211
01:39:16,351 --> 01:39:20,310
No more than you deserve for the first signature

1212
01:39:20,355 --> 01:39:25,315
in the Charter of the International Super Hero.

1213
01:39:41,343 --> 01:39:42,469
My goodness!

1214
01:39:42,511 --> 01:39:46,447
Put out the fire.

1215
01:39:52,354 --> 01:39:55,380
He is coming.

1216
01:40:02,531 --> 01:40:04,328
Is he okay?

1217
01:40:04,366 --> 01:40:08,234
I told you to take care of today ...

1218
01:40:31,426 --> 01:40:34,224
No!

1219
01:40:34,229 --> 01:40:36,220
Give it to me cake.

1220
01:40:36,264 --> 01:40:39,324
Cake again?

1221
01:40:51,313 --> 01:40:54,476
- See you later. - Get back!

1222
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,448
- Damn. - Through this way.

1223
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:07,327
Once again the world is becoming a super back.

1224
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:14,234
Looking ahead, come on. Next to everything.

1225

March. Come on, line up.

1226

Everything smile.

1227
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:26,440
Continue Phase 2.

1228
01:41:26,481 --> 01:41:36,288
You always made it difficult, just to tidy up your carelessness.

1229
01:41:36,324 --> 01:41:42,388
Your body is weak, and you will receive a reward for it.

1230
01:41:42,397 --> 01:41:45,457
We no longer serve you. We only serve ourselves.

1231
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:49,368
We wish the best survived.

1232
01:41:50,305 --> 01:41:54,298
That scene is very harmonious one.

1233
01:41:54,342 --> 01:41:59,473
And before advertising, be careful.

1234
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:15,353
- Emergency ... - Let him call.

1235
01:42:15,363 --> 01:42:17,422
Superheroes take over the bridge by force.

1236
01:42:17,432 --> 01:42:20,401
- Repeat. - Now!

1237
01:42:30,278 --> 01:42:35,215
A little more ... stop.

1238
01:42:39,387 --> 01:42:41,514
What? Baby?

1239
01:42:41,523 --> 01:42:44,492
mother and father.

1240
01:42:47,262 --> 01:42:50,390
Jack-like, no!

1241
01:42:51,232 --> 01:42:56,363
Super baby? No, no.

1242
01:42:58,273 --> 01:43:01,470
No, no! Put him down.

1243
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:06,269
Mother. Catch this.

1244
01:43:13,288 --> 01:43:15,518
No!

1245
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:20,392
- Hey, it's me. - Yes, that's what I thought last time.

1246
01:43:20,428 --> 01:43:25,365
You come for us?

1247
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:28,301
- Do not be angry. - Oh dear.

1248
01:43:28,303 --> 01:43:30,271
How can I do that?

1249
01:43:30,305 --> 01:43:32,364
I am proud.

1250
01:43:32,407 --> 01:43:35,501
Not intend to ruin the atmosphere, but we are no where?

1251
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:40,470
- What is the problem Devtech? - Evelyn Deavor, controlling ...

1252
01:43:40,482 --> 01:43:43,315
we.

1253
01:43:43,351 --> 01:43:48,311
- Where the wheel? - Did I do that?

1254
01:43:48,323 --> 01:43:49,449
Seragammu.GuavaBerry

1255
01:43:49,491 --> 01:43:52,426
Capture.

1256
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:57,262
Phase 3, continue phase 3.

1257
01:43:59,267 --> 01:44:01,292
Why are children here? Do not you go home?

1258
01:44:01,336 --> 01:44:04,499
I went to the house, just ask them.

1259
01:44:04,506 --> 01:44:06,269
He's lying.

1260
01:44:06,307 --> 01:44:09,333
Okay, you should not ...

1261
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:13,406
Caution!

1262
01:44:15,517 --> 01:44:21,251
- Jack-Jack, had the power? - We'll talk later.

1263
01:44:55,256 --> 01:44:57,349
Mata laser.

1264
01:45:23,518 --> 01:45:25,486
Come on follow me.

1265
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,488
- We're done? - You'll be safe here.

1266
01:45:27,488 --> 01:45:31,322
Secure? Safe from what?

1267
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:35,352
- Diplomats, superheroes ... - They hypnotized.

1268
01:45:35,363 --> 01:45:38,355
What have you done?

1269
01:45:41,269 --> 01:45:43,294
Evelyn, he fled.

1270
01:45:43,304 --> 01:45:46,501
- Well, go after him. Complete your mission. - I can not just leave.

1271
01:45:46,507 --> 01:45:50,375
How are the kids? Jack-Jack?

1272
01:45:50,411 --> 01:45:53,505
Go, we can handle this.

1273
01:45:54,315 --> 01:45:56,249
Voyd, come with me.

1274
01:45:56,251 --> 01:45:58,481
- I'm going to turn off the engine. - I'm going to slow down the boat.

1275
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:02,250
Wait, where the gun?

1276
01:46:02,290 --> 01:46:04,451
Sitting now!

1277
01:46:19,374 --> 01:46:22,400
- For the sake of good. - No!

1278
01:46:22,443 --> 01:46:25,310
thanks.

1279
01:46:35,356 --> 01:46:39,292
- What is your plan? - Take me to the top of the jet.

1280
01:47:01,449 --> 01:47:04,441
Hey, you do this. Can you do it again?

1281
01:47:04,452 --> 01:47:07,285
- Do you want me back? - What?

1282
01:47:07,322 --> 01:47:11,349
- Can not do that? - No, I do not Protects crushed crusher.

1283
01:47:11,359 --> 01:47:14,453
Entry into the engine room. Forget, not enough time.

1284
01:47:14,495 --> 01:47:19,398
When you were asked to return to normal, what are you doing?

1285
01:47:21,469 --> 01:47:27,465
Welcome to the airlines Elastigirl, we reached cruising altitude.

1286
01:47:27,508 --> 01:47:33,447
For the sake of your safety wear seat belts, or silent and calm.

1287
01:47:33,448 --> 01:47:37,316
It's all about you.

1288
01:47:45,293 --> 01:47:48,262
- I can not enter the engine room. - We have to do something.

1289
01:47:48,296 --> 01:47:49,456
I've tried to slow down but to no avail.

1290
01:47:49,464 --> 01:47:51,398
Hey, how about reversing the boat?

1291
01:47:51,432 --> 01:47:52,490
That's not a good idea.

1292
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:55,298
- That means, we will be outside. - Yes!

1293
01:47:55,303 --> 01:48:00,240
If we put the brakes on the reef and change kincirnya we can keep the ship from the city.

1294
01:48:00,274 --> 01:48:01,502
- It might work. - I'll divert the ship,

1295
01:48:01,542 --> 01:48:04,272
- you bend kincirnya. - Using the stairs?

1296
01:48:04,278 --> 01:48:07,338
It was under water, how? Oh, unbelievable.

1297
01:48:07,382 --> 01:48:09,441
- Come on, kids. - Dad!

1298
01:48:09,484 --> 01:48:14,251
I know this will work, but if it did not work when we crash,

1299
01:48:14,288 --> 01:48:17,416
shield will protect this ship.

1300
01:48:17,425 --> 01:48:21,384
I have to live here, along with Jack-Jack.

1301
01:48:21,396 --> 01:48:22,454
That's just my daughter.

1302
01:48:22,497 --> 01:48:27,332
Come on, steered to the right.

1303
01:48:32,373 --> 01:48:35,433
You know what's bad?

1304
01:48:37,445 --> 01:48:42,508
The work is not recognized in your life, by your good friend.

1305
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:45,348
I wish I had ...

1306
01:48:45,353 --> 01:48:48,345
that ability.

1307
01:48:49,323 --> 01:48:52,486
The latest news, still no radio contact

1308
01:48:52,527 --> 01:48:58,329
The boat had changed direction and headed for the city at high speed.

1309
01:49:01,369 --> 01:49:03,360
Hear.

1310
01:49:04,272 --> 01:49:09,369
- After I turn this boat, you press the button. - Okay, dad.

1311
01:49:09,410 --> 01:49:12,345
Now drop anchor ...

1312
01:49:14,482 --> 01:49:18,316
Reputation as a super hero is destroyed.

1313
01:49:18,352 --> 01:49:22,311
You'll never be legal.

1314
01:49:22,323 --> 01:49:24,257
Never?

1315
01:49:24,258 --> 01:49:25,225
No.

1316
01:49:25,259 --> 01:49:27,227
- At all? - No.

1317
01:49:27,228 --> 01:49:30,391
Not at all?

1318
01:49:30,431 --> 01:49:36,370
Hypoxia, lack of oxygen in your brain.

1319
01:49:42,477 --> 01:49:46,470
You will feel weak and then you will die.

1320
01:49:46,514 --> 01:49:50,473
- I do not want to die. - No one wants to die.

1321
01:49:50,518 --> 01:49:52,383
Seriously?

1322
01:49:52,386 --> 01:49:55,446
Pity you.

1323
01:50:12,473 --> 01:50:18,503
Everything, we have to go to the back of the boat. Superheroes protect the ambassador.

1324
01:50:18,513 --> 01:50:21,380
Go!

1325
01:50:22,517 --> 01:50:27,318
He spent too long in the water.

1326
01:50:33,394 --> 01:50:38,354
- Pull him. - Wait, is too early.

1327
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:54,372
- He's going to die. - Patience!

1328
01:51:07,495 --> 01:51:11,226
The ship turned. It worked.

1329
01:51:13,401 --> 01:51:17,303
- Now! - Ralph, now!

1330
01:51:18,506 --> 01:51:22,306
Let's open the parachute.

1331
01:51:23,411 --> 01:51:27,245
Open the chute.

1332
01:51:28,316 --> 01:51:32,252
Helen, use a parachute.

1333
01:51:38,326 --> 01:51:41,420
We're going to die!

1334
01:52:01,349 --> 01:52:04,341
I missed the first drama Jack-Jack?

1335
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:08,345
Actually, you missed the first 17 years.

1336
01:52:20,368 --> 01:52:24,395
The fact you saved me does not make you right.

1337
01:52:24,438 --> 01:52:28,374
- But, that keep you alive. - And I'm grateful for that.

1338
01:52:28,409 --> 01:52:31,401
Sorry, but what I know you?

1339
01:52:31,412 --> 01:52:35,348
Sorry, he will not accept to be treated like that again.

1340
01:52:35,383 --> 01:52:38,375
First of all, Violet I like you.

1341
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:45,382
And who knows the future? But I have a good feeling with you all.

1342
01:52:45,393 --> 01:52:46,382
A good feeling?

1343
01:52:46,427 --> 01:52:48,395
What should we worry?

1344
01:52:48,396 --> 01:52:51,229
You must.

1345
01:52:51,265 --> 01:52:53,290
I see what you did before, it was incredible.

1346
01:52:53,301 --> 01:52:57,362
And not everyone can do it.

1347
01:52:58,306 --> 01:53:02,242
My favorite car.

1348
01:53:13,421 --> 01:53:18,324
On extraordinary services they have done

1349
01:53:18,359 --> 01:53:24,298
With this super hero status restated legal.

1350
01:53:31,472 --> 01:53:36,466
- You do not know, right? - No, wait ...

1351
01:53:36,477 --> 01:53:41,244
- What do you girls who wear the mask? - I'm Violet.

1352
01:53:41,282 --> 01:53:43,443
I'm Tony.

1353
01:53:53,361 --> 01:53:55,454
- Tony, this is my mother. - Nice to meet you.

1354
01:53:55,463 --> 01:53:58,227
- It's my father. - We never met.

1355
01:53:58,265 --> 01:54:02,463
- This is embarrassing ... my brother Dash. - I'm short.

1356
01:54:02,503 --> 01:54:08,499
And baby Jack-Jack. I tried to reduce so one parent.

1357
01:54:08,509 --> 01:54:11,376
We're all going to watch a movie, honey.

1358
01:54:11,379 --> 01:54:16,373
Too early, we decided on the theater. Not like that?

1359
01:54:16,417 --> 01:54:23,380
He jokes, they just drove us to the theater. They have other business.

1360
01:54:23,391 --> 01:54:26,360
So, I think you guys close.

1361
01:54:26,394 --> 01:54:30,353
- I guess. - We can get closer.

1362
01:54:44,345 --> 01:54:45,471
Let us out.

1363
01:54:45,479 --> 01:54:49,472
Sorry, Tony. Buy popcorn, find a chair for me.

1364
01:54:49,517 --> 01:54:54,477
I was back before the preview ends.
