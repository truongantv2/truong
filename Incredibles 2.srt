Incredibles 2 next 8 min


2
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:31,715
Violation 2-712, Rick Dicker interrogating agent.

3
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,719
Please specify your name.

4
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:37,789
Uh... Tony.

5
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,724
Tony Rydinger.

6
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:43,693
Tell me about what happened.

7
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:46,789
Well there is this girl in my class.

8
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:48,697
I saw it on the track running.

9
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,668
You, Violet is not it?

10
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:51,634
That's me.

11
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:53,627
I know little about him, but he changed.

12
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:56,800
He was more relaxed, confident, cool, sweet.

13
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:58,639
I asked her to go to the cinema.

14
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:00,611
- So, Friday? Friday. - Friday.

15
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:02,671
And I went from there.

16
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:07,617
Not long after that, this incident occurred in the parking lot.

17
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:22,761
Meet the Underminer.

18
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:27,795
I was always under but nothing is beneath me.

19
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:31,606
And the situation is very strange and when I saw these boots.

20
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:33,736
- You two stay here. - Are we really going to do this?

21
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:34,768
It is still illegal, right?

22
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:36,804
They look like a super hero.

23
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:38,715
- They're going to lose him? - Oh okay.

24
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,583
One of you berjagalah on the perimeter, secure the people from here.

25
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,644
You have to keep Jack-jack.

26
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:44,713
- I think we are in this together. - You heard your mother.

27
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:47,623
Create a trampoline.

28
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,654
I guard the perimeter.

29
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:55,656
You can not go anywhere. Come back here!

30
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,600
I saw a chance to get out of there.

31
00:09:57,602 --> 00:10:00,799
But I know the sound of one of the children.

32
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,572
The girl's voice. He was angry and threw his mask. And that's it!

33
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,578
Oh, Tony!

34
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:10,581
Hi. It's not what you think.

35
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:13,813
This is too weird I can not handle it, I fled.

36
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:15,649
I feel bad about it.

37
00:10:15,654 --> 00:10:18,623
Maybe I should have said '' Hi '' or something.

38
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:20,591
Not because he Superhero illegal.

39
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,651
And is not I do not like girls who are stronger, I'm pretty confident.

40
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:24,720
Virility problems.

41
00:10:24,763 --> 00:10:25,730
What is that?

42
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:27,732
Did you tell this to anyone else?

43
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:30,735
- Your parents? - No. They do not like to know anything.

44
00:10:30,735 --> 00:10:32,532
You know what I mean?

45
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:36,701
- I know, son. - I like this girl, Mr. Dicker should I go with him Friday night.

46
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,802
And now would be a strange situation.

47
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:42,780
I wish I could say sorry to him.

48
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:44,749
You're going to say, son.

49
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:47,581
You're going to say it.

50
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,594
Come on!

51
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:24,553
Let's just say you've had in the blast from below!

52
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,678
- Underminer! We meet again. - What?

53
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:57,686
Oh, come on. Now he was trapped inside.

54
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:09,791
Oh!

55
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:12,761
lncredibles!

56
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:16,537
Introduce Jackhammer!

57
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,767
Feel this.

58
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,778
Until found!

59
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:45,601
No no no.

60
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:53,540
Everyone, back off, okay? Retreat.

61
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:57,771
Dash, do not make me keep the baby.

62
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:04,653
I tried to stop him, and Underminer escape.

63
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:08,592
Does it ever make you stop ... Bob, monorailnya!

64
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:16,759
Frozone! Already!

65
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:22,732
We have to stop this thing before it destroys the town hall.

66
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:25,766
I'll try to keep him away from the building.

67
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:37,714
Hey, lady.

68
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:41,820
Thank you very much, young man.

69
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:50,599
Violet!

70
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:05,650
Stop!

71
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,551
All stop!

72
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:37,715
Alert, father.

73
00:14:37,716 --> 00:14:39,741
Dash!

74
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:43,583
Violet, who's taking care of Jack-Jack?

75
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:47,614
- Dad in charge ... - Violet, take him.

76
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:57,726
This thing is headed to City Hall.

77
00:14:57,736 --> 00:15:00,637
Mother needs help.

78
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:11,513
Look at this, this is our chance, follow them, follow Frozone.

79
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:24,786
Bob!

80
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:28,560
Help me with this pillar.

81
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,673
Supposedly it can stop it.

82
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:46,741
Children, what are you doing? Get out of here!

83
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:48,616
It's going to explode!

84
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:50,814
There is no more time!

85
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:03,757
We did it!

86
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:05,565
Do not move, super hero!

87
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,664
Oh, what we've done.

88
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,577
Hey, wait, Mr. Zone?

89
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:19,550
Sorry, I should not be here.

90
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:22,576
That seems to be wrong, is not it?

91
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,818
Maybe you're interested in changing the law?

92
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:31,561
Superheroes including Frozone, Mr. lncredibles, and Elasticgirl ...

93
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:33,622
prevent further damage in the city.

94
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:35,724
The Underminer still unknown.

95
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,598
We did not start this conflict.

96
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:38,626
And you do not end well!

97
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,662
- You stop Underminer to destroy more? - No.

98
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:44,574
- Did you stop him rob a bank? - No.

99
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:46,577
- Did you catch it? - No.

100
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:50,571
The bank was already insured, we have the infrastructure to overcome this problem ...

101
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:54,813
if you did not do anything this is all still going to happen.

102
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:57,583
You would rather we did not do anything?

103
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:00,581
So true.

104
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:04,653
You did not help.

105
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:10,692
If you want to get out of the hole, you have to put the first shovel.

106
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,639
Wow it's awful.

107
00:17:15,673 --> 00:17:21,543
Dad, maybe this is not the best time to tell you this, but ...

108
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:23,605
Something happened today.

109
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:27,711
A child, and my mask.

110
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:47,594
Okay, Rick, a friend of Violet, Tony, see it without using a mask.

111
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:50,733
- There are other info? - I do not know her last name Rydinger.

112
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:54,734
Tony Rydinger. I'll check it out.

113
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:56,611
Bob, Helen.

114
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:59,583
I want to talk if you do not mind.

115
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:01,717
The program is stopped.

116
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:03,584
What?

117
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:08,615
Politicians do not understand people who do good things because it was the right move.

118
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,525
Make them nervous.

119
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:15,658
They target Superheroes many years ago, and today they need.

120
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:18,636
Anyway, I'm done.

121
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,629
I'm worried about two weeks at the motel was the best that I can do for you.

122
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,665
- It's not much. - You have a lot of help, Rick.

123
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:26,540
We will not forget it.

124
00:18:26,577 --> 00:18:29,808
Well, an honor working with you guys, good people.

125
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:32,681
Thank you for everything. And good luck.

126
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:35,710
Yes, you too.

127
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,802
Did you wash your hands?

128
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:56,540
With the soap?

129
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:59,576
Is it dry?

130
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:04,843
What? Is this all the vegetables?

131
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:06,749
Who ordered this vegetable all?

132
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:09,777
I order it. It's good for you.

133
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:12,688
Are we going to talk about it?

134
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,783
- What? - elephant in this room.

135
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:15,815
What elephant?

136
00:19:15,827 --> 00:19:17,590
I do not think so.

137
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:19,596
- You mean about today? - Yes.

138
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:20,621
What's with today?

139
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:21,791
We all make mistakes.

140
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,768
For example, you should keep children Jack-Jack.

141
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:28,535
Keeping the baby, while you do the things that are important.

142
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:29,597
We already talked about this.

143
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:31,598
You're not mature enough to decide this.

144
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:33,634
- We are old enough to help. - Yes!

145
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:35,578
Is not that what you say to us, dad?

146
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,640
Yes, well, help it can mean many things.

147
00:19:38,683 --> 00:19:41,550
- But we have to help where there is a sense of trust. - Yes.

148
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:43,611
- Are you glad we help today? - I know. But...

149
00:19:43,654 --> 00:19:46,646
- You said you were proud of us. - Well, I used to, I'm proud.

150
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:49,524
We want to fight criminals.

151
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,551
No, you can not.

152
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:53,530
You said different situation now.

153
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:55,657
And that is right. On the island.

154
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,600
But I do not mean that from now on ...

155
00:19:57,602 --> 00:19:59,797
Now we do not use our strength back again.

156
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:03,706
- That's what makes me strong. - I did not say ... what?

157
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:04,799
Someone says.

158
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:07,640
Can we eat it. Dinner.

159
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:09,670
While still hot.

160
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,545
Are we doing something wrong?

161
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:12,708
- Yes. - No.

162
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:14,742
We did not do anything wrong.

163
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:17,584
Superhero illegal.

164
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:18,816
Whether it's fair or not, it's legal.

165
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:21,792
The law should be fair. That's why we teach it to our children.

166
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:24,795
- We follow the law. - Although the law to harass?

167
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:29,562
If it was unjust law is no law to replace it. Otherwise there will be chaos.

168
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,695
That's what happened today.

169
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:39,576
I thought this was cool.

170
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,577
What?

171
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:44,570
As a crime against the family.

172
00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:46,641
That's cool.

173
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:47,742
But that's over.

174
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:49,652
But this is happening in the world.

175
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:51,645
We have to adapt.

176
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:53,623
Is the situation worse now?

177
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:56,525
Fine state.

178
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,688
May I have permission?

179
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,796
How long are we at the motel, father?

180
00:21:04,836 --> 00:21:07,771
Soon, dear.

181
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:15,668
What we will do?

182
00:21:15,713 --> 00:21:17,681
I do not know.

183
00:21:17,682 --> 00:21:20,651
- Maybe Dicker will find something. - Dicker is no longer there, Bob.

184
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:23,711
All our thoughts become Superheroes again, it was just wishful thinking.

185
00:21:23,754 --> 00:21:25,654
One of us had to work.

186
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:26,714
One of us?

187
00:21:26,757 --> 00:21:28,782
You do not stand working in an insurance company.

188
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:32,559
- I can not stand cheating them. - I know it's hard for you.

189
00:21:32,597 --> 00:21:36,761
- Maybe it's my turn to work in the private sector and you keep ... - No, I did it.

190
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:39,565
I need to do this.

191
00:21:39,604 --> 00:21:44,632
- Do you know where coat and my tie? - Burned when our house burned.

192
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:46,540
Ya.

193
00:21:46,544 --> 00:21:48,671
We can not depend on anyone else now, Bob.

194
00:21:48,713 --> 00:21:49,702
There is only us.

195
00:21:49,714 --> 00:21:52,683
We can not wait for ...

196
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:02,583
There were no guards manning pool.

197
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:03,719
Swim responsibility own risk.

198
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:05,593
Oh, where are you today?

199
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,621
I know you missed all the fun.

200
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:10,634
Do not get angry, because I do not come to your party.

201
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:14,594
I'm not as good as you, and besides I know the police will deliver you.

202
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:17,802
- Yes. That's the power of Bob. - Yes, yes.

203
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:20,743
I heard the program was discontinued.

204
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:22,645
How long are you in this motel?

205
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,704
2 weeks.

206
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:25,682
And you know the offer is still valid.

207
00:22:25,716 --> 00:22:29,675
You are very good, and the five of us. We do not want to do that to your wife.

208
00:22:29,687 --> 00:22:31,655
The door is always open.

209
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:33,714
You know the news is not always bad.

210
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:40,527
While you're on hold, I was approached by a man who represents a wealthy man.

211
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:41,623
Winston Deavor.

212
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:45,796
She wanted to talk to me and you both about the problem Superhero.

213
00:22:45,803 --> 00:22:49,739
I've checked it, she was fine, wanted to recruit Dicker, he wanted to meet.

214
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:51,833
Oh, my goodness, the more problems Superhero?

215
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:54,606
We just got out of trouble.

216
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:55,544
We're coming.

217
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:57,741
Tonight, I'll go now.

218
00:22:57,782 --> 00:22:59,773
Enjoy it, I do not want to get involved.

219
00:22:59,784 --> 00:23:01,649
He wants us three.

220
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:04,780
Unfortunately, at least we hear first what was going on katakannya.

221
00:23:04,822 --> 00:23:07,757
Do you have an address, I meet you there.

222
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,783
Superhero costumes go with us?

223
00:23:09,794 --> 00:23:14,527
Yes. Wear your costume Superheroes long.

224
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:17,728
I sensed that he wanted.

225
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:22,571
You're going where?

226
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:26,543
- The air is very fresh tonight. - You know who the phone ...

227
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:29,604
I know what to dlakukan.

228
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:39,590
Security card to you.

229
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:41,592
Please come this way.

230
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:46,552
Sir, are you a fan I weigh, I'm a fan ... Right.

231
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:48,656
Shit.

232
00:24:10,554 --> 00:24:13,819
I Love Superheroes!

233
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,590
I understand your struggle.

234
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:19,653
Winston Deavor. You can call me Wins.

235
00:24:19,664 --> 00:24:22,599
It was very nice to meet you. Frozone!

236
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:24,567
- Elasticgirl. - Nice to meet you.

237
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:25,830
- Mr. lncredibles.- Halo.

238
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:34,642
~ Mr. lncredibles, lncredibles, catch criminals, pow pow!

239
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:37,614
~ Who's the cat that got you ...

240
00:24:37,615 --> 00:24:40,675
~ When survived virtually no chance ...

241
00:24:40,718 --> 00:24:43,778
~ Frozone, Frozone.

242
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:46,655
~ Frozone!

243
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:47,749
Ya!

244
00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:50,693
I will tell you about what all of this, and this is ...

245
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:54,529
Oh, hello ... Superhero. I am sorry...

246
00:24:54,565 --> 00:25:00,526
- It's strange sister, Evelyn. - I'm not weird, you do not need to be so, Winston.

247
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:01,630
Spectacular.

248
00:25:01,672 --> 00:25:06,575
My father was very proud that I know you from afar.

249
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:08,807
He used to call you, the last defense.

250
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:11,577
He is a staunch supporter of you.

251
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:13,708
He donated on behalf of the Superhero.

252
00:25:13,751 --> 00:25:16,720
To raise funds to build a statue in the park Dynaguy Avery.

253
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:18,722
He knew many Superhero personally.

254
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:25,595
Even installed a phone with a direct line to Gazerbeam and Bionic for emergencies.

255
00:25:25,596 --> 00:25:27,723
She loved it. He showed it to everyone.

256
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:30,701
He was disappointed once when you are forced to go into hiding.

257
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:35,672
My father believed the world a dangerous place without you.

258
00:25:35,673 --> 00:25:38,608
You know he's right.

259
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:40,769
There was theft.

260
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:46,580
My dad called Gazerbeam, direct line ...

261
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:47,709
No answer.

262
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:49,652
She called Bionic.

263
00:25:49,653 --> 00:25:50,642
No answer.

264
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:53,816
Superheroes just become illegal.

265
00:25:53,824 --> 00:25:58,693
The thief was seeing my dad called, and shot him.

266
00:25:58,796 --> 00:26:01,526
So...

267
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,657
Definitely hard to ...

268
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,531
Especially for the mother.

269
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:06,593
He died a few months later.

270
00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:07,593
Broken hearted.

271
00:26:07,638 --> 00:26:11,574
If Superheroes are not forced to hide this will never happen.

272
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:14,772
Or the father could take the mother to a secure room so knew there was a robbery.

273
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:19,739
I totally disagree, but we do not do it now.

274
00:26:19,784 --> 00:26:25,620
The point is no one thought we could run the company my father.

275
00:26:25,623 --> 00:26:28,717
And Evelyn as a designer, and myself as the operator ...

276
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:32,786
Make us build Devtech become what it is today.

277
00:26:32,797 --> 00:26:36,790
- the last communication company in the world. - Bigger than ever.

278
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:40,565
The right position to make justify the wrong thing.

279
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:42,539
Because it then there is this meeting.

280
00:26:42,573 --> 00:26:43,733
Let me ask you guys something.

281
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:47,734
- What are the main causes you have to hide? - Ignorance.

282
00:26:47,745 --> 00:26:49,645
Perception.

283
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,843
Take for example today with Underminer. A difficult situation.

284
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,614
You are faced with many difficult decisions.

285
00:26:55,653 --> 00:26:56,711
So true.

286
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,812
I can not.

287
00:26:57,855 --> 00:27:00,688
Because I do not see it.

288
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:02,591
Likewise with other people.

289
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:04,754
So when you guys fight bad guys like today ...

290
00:27:04,795 --> 00:27:07,696
people do not see fights or situations memukainya ...

291
00:27:07,698 --> 00:27:09,757
They see what is desired by politicians ...

292
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,701
They see the destruction, and they see you.

293
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:16,730
So if you want people to change their perception about you guys the Heroes Super ...

294
00:27:16,774 --> 00:27:20,710
We need you to share you with the world's perception.

295
00:27:20,711 --> 00:27:21,735
How do we do it?

296
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:23,610
With the camera.

297
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:26,741
You share perceptions with the world.

298
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,774
How do we do it?

299
00:27:27,785 --> 00:27:31,619
We put a small camera like that into your Super Hero costume.

300
00:27:31,655 --> 00:27:32,747
Wow. Very small.

301
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:34,747
- And incredible shape. - Thank you.

302
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:35,781
I designed it myself.

303
00:27:35,826 --> 00:27:40,661
We have the resources, lobbyists, connections across the world and a very important ...

304
00:27:40,664 --> 00:27:42,655
- Insurance. - Insurance is the key.

305
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,533
What we need now is Superhero.

306
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:50,734
That means three of you, come help me make Superhero legal again.

307
00:27:50,741 --> 00:27:54,643
It sounds great, let's get started, what our first task?

308
00:27:54,645 --> 00:28:02,677
Enthusiastic was nice, keep it, but it's our first step, Elasticgirl our hero.

309
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,517
Better than me?

310
00:28:04,555 --> 00:28:06,546
Ya.

311
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:11,722
I mean, he's great, really, but you know ...

312
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:12,694
Do you know...

313
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,689
With all due respect, let's not rush, insurance paid for everything.

314
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,692
It's just the beginning, okay?

315
00:28:19,737 --> 00:28:21,705
Wait, what say?

316
00:28:21,705 --> 00:28:22,729
I'm a mess?

317
00:28:22,773 --> 00:28:28,734
Evelyn analysis when you fight crime during the five years prior to hide.

318
00:28:28,746 --> 00:28:30,805
Figures Elasticgirl can explain himself.

319
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,713
Gee was not a fair comparison.

320
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,776
All major problem, need big solutions.

321
00:28:35,786 --> 00:28:39,722
Of course. We will solve all the problems together.

322
00:28:39,723 --> 00:28:45,559
After a perfect launch with Elasticgirl.

323
00:28:45,563 --> 00:28:48,828
- So, what do you think? - What do I think?

324
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:54,694
- I do not know. - What do you mean you do not know.

325
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:59,540
A few hours ago, you told us to be a super hero fantasy.

326
00:28:59,577 --> 00:29:02,637
Now you get an offer of a lifetime and you do not know?

327
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,808
It's not that easy, Bob. I do not want troublesome children.

328
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:09,580
- I also. - From prison, Bob.

329
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:12,784
How did you do it? By rejecting the opportunity to change it.

330
00:29:12,823 --> 00:29:14,620
Forcing them off as they are?

331
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:16,752
What happens with who they are? They're just kids.

332
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,627
Children with strength, which makes them super.

333
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:21,790
Between them they decided to use force or not.

334
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:25,599
- This is going to benefit them. - Listen, this is not a good time to go.

335
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:29,630
Dashiel have a problem with homework, Violet concerned with the man she loves.

336
00:29:29,673 --> 00:29:33,769
- Tony. And Jack ... - Jack? What is up with her?

337
00:29:33,811 --> 00:29:38,544
Well, nothing wrong with it. But normal baby needs attention.

338
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:41,541
- I'm not sure I can go. - Of course you can go.

339
00:29:41,552 --> 00:29:47,718
You have to, so I, we ... Could stronger together again. So our children can have fun.

340
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:52,819
- So you have that option. - Well, yes. So I can have that choice.

341
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,628
And I will do a terrific job.

342
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:58,602
Although they say about me.

343
00:29:58,636 --> 00:30:02,538
But they want you.

344
00:30:02,573 --> 00:30:09,638
And you will be great. Actually.

345
00:30:10,814 --> 00:30:15,649
That's really bad. Why can not you ...

346
00:30:15,653 --> 00:30:18,679
That's good to want the glory, you know. But...

347
00:30:18,722 --> 00:30:21,691
What are the options? One, Lucius right, well paid,

348
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:25,685
rather than being in the motel, and the kids better, including our children.

349
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:29,790
Or second, I'm looking for a job within two weeks and return.

350
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:32,634
You know it's crazy, is not it?

351
00:30:32,636 --> 00:30:35,628
To help my family, I had to lie down on the shore, I must destroy ...

352
00:30:35,673 --> 00:30:37,698
- You will be enormous. - I know I would.

353
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:38,766
But what about you? We have children.

354
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:41,573
I'll take care of children. No problem. Easy.

355
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:46,675
Easy, huh? You brag. If there are problems, I will cancel and go home.

356
00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:50,711
You do not need to, I can, you just leave. Do it.

357
00:30:50,754 --> 00:30:55,521
Just do it, I'll give you a bear.

358
00:30:56,727 --> 00:31:01,630
- It Deavor. - It Elastigirl, I agree.

359
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:07,626
Mr. Deavor, is unusual. But you are too generous.

360
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:09,605
Nonsense. This is at least what we can do.

361
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:12,803
We are now colleagues. Can not have my partner stayed at the motel.

362
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,779
- Whose house? A house? - It's my house.

363
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:19,749
I have several. You live how long it takes.

364
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:21,580
I do not know what to say.

365
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:23,746
How to thank you?

366
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:28,590
- This is our new home? - I think so, take it easy, champ.

367
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,684
- It's ours. - Yes.

368
00:31:30,694 --> 00:31:32,662
- Mother. - Look at this place.

369
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:36,598
Deavor buy from certain kolongmerat who like to come and go.

370
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,763
Without visible, so this house has some hidden place.

371
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:44,740
Things you will not be exposed. With one unknown.

372
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:46,733
This house has a spacious yard.

373
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:50,736
- This ... Is not it redundant. - Have the field.

374
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:54,774
- What do you prefer in the motel? - It's a pool.

375
00:31:55,552 --> 00:31:59,818
- What exactly is the mother's new job? - Most importantly, we are out of the motel.

376
00:31:59,823 --> 00:32:03,657
I love the new mother's job.

377
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:17,631
Wow, look at the water feature.

378
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:24,578
to live please.

379
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:34,553
- Oh no! - Stop it.

380
00:32:34,591 --> 00:32:36,752
- Watch out! - Dad!

381
00:32:36,794 --> 00:32:39,661
Log in to the pool. No!

382
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:44,768
I, nothing ...

383
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:50,699
Dark and antiques. I Elastigirl. I, you know ...

384
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:53,676
- Flexible. I mean ... No. - Are you designing this?

385
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,679
Of a man named Alexander Gawkin.

386
00:32:56,713 --> 00:33:02,618
Glad it's you, not me, because you will have to do with this record.

387
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:06,646
- What? - Elastigirl, the vehicle is in the garage. Evelyn

388
00:33:10,594 --> 00:33:14,758
- Motor new Elastic. - Elasticycle? I do not know you have a motor.

389
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:17,767
Hey, I got a Mohawk. There's a lot about me that you do not know.

390
00:33:17,801 --> 00:33:20,668
Ya, Mohawk?

391
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:22,764
You did not miss anything.

392
00:33:24,641 --> 00:33:29,544
- Oh, yes. This one electric. - What does it mean?

393
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:36,752
- Errors. Sorry. Should improve. - You will be enormous.

394
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:40,689
- I'll be great. And you too. - We'll both be great.

395
00:33:40,724 --> 00:33:42,715
Goodbye My Love.

396
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:07,807
- Wait a minute, it Elastigirl? - Elastigirl.

397
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,727
Hei, Elastigirl.

398
00:34:20,664 --> 00:34:22,757
Elastigirl tiba.

399
00:34:22,766 --> 00:34:26,759
- You're right on time. - It spins five times.

400
00:34:29,673 --> 00:34:34,576
Look at it. New place. You want to make the company's skyscrapers.

401
00:34:34,611 --> 00:34:38,570
- You arrive in the city with the highest crime. - The strange thing, is not it? We're talking about.

402
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:41,709
It's like a playground superheroes.

403
00:34:44,755 --> 00:34:47,781
Not much sugar in my custody.

404
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:53,528
- Where's the mother? - He's out. He was at his new job.

405
00:34:53,563 --> 00:34:56,794
- Be a hero. - I think superheroes are still illegal.

406
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,665
They are illegal for now.

407
00:34:58,702 --> 00:35:01,671
So mothers be paid for breaking the rules.

408
00:35:01,672 --> 00:35:05,540
He did not violate ... He was in Africa for a super hero.

409
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:07,805
- It's a new job. - So, the mother went.

410
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:12,646
Illegally to tour why she should be illegal.

411
00:35:12,683 --> 00:35:16,642
Hey Hey. Bus tiba.

412
00:35:16,653 --> 00:35:20,612
Grab your things, Dash, go ...

413
00:35:20,757 --> 00:35:23,692
Put your homework on the bag.

414
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,785
Goodbye.

415
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:37,529
We will be fine. You do not ask the tough questions

416
00:35:39,676 --> 00:35:42,645
Well, do not worry.

417
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:46,615
- What am I? - It's weird. Many crimes.

418
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:51,678
True, you're in the middle of the worst crime area of ââthe city. It was perfect.

419
00:35:51,688 --> 00:35:54,748
- This is a friend to play superheroes. - Friends playing superheroes, either.

420
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:58,727
No, when we were hiding. My husband always said alert.

421
00:35:58,762 --> 00:36:02,664
Waiting for something to happen. And I'm angry with him for it.

422
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:06,803
- Uh, I almost forgot. Something happens. - The entire unit ...

423
00:36:06,837 --> 00:36:11,536
I get the conversation about the disorder at the opening ceremony.

424
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:13,668
- Interference or a threat? - Both.

425
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,702
- Case 54. Ordered. - A threat.

426
00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:20,615
Perfect. 54, after him. Come on, come on.

427
00:36:21,785 --> 00:36:25,551
Vio, I want you back here at 10:30.

428
00:36:25,555 --> 00:36:30,686
- Oh, after that? Okay, 10:30. - Done. 10:30.

429
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:32,594
Enjoy her movies.

430
00:36:32,629 --> 00:36:37,566
In the ninth meeting Ark is, cutter, the ...

431
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:41,833
Everything is given to the loser sleep. Asleep.

432
00:36:51,748 --> 00:36:53,716
What was discussed?

433
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:56,550
We will control the earth.

434
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,747
We can rule the world.

435
00:37:01,758 --> 00:37:06,627
That's not the way to calculate it, dad. It's a way to do it.

436
00:37:06,663 --> 00:37:09,757
I do not know how it is. Why did they change the math.

437
00:37:09,766 --> 00:37:11,791
- It's okay, dad. - That's not math, it's math.

438
00:37:11,835 --> 00:37:13,803
I'll wait for the mother to return.

439
00:37:13,804 --> 00:37:18,537
What? He will not know more than me.

440
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:20,668
They called Linus.

441
00:37:22,646 --> 00:37:28,778
Everything used, Turbor disturbed. While asleep, simply because they can not pursue.

442
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:37,591
Quasi asleep and snoring. Eyes are very heavy.

443
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:42,692
Surviving, in essence, everyone, everyone sitting in the hay.

444
00:37:42,732 --> 00:37:46,532
Everyone was asleep, which they lack.

445
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,802
The mayor usually exaggerate about their city, and I'm no exception.

446
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:54,709
And I believe, you feel it.

447
00:37:54,744 --> 00:37:56,769
Are you confident the police would be okay with this?

448
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,771
Of course, that's the easy part.

449
00:37:58,782 --> 00:38:01,717
They have not forgiven us have made their lives easier.

450
00:38:01,718 --> 00:38:04,551
I know the police chief, it would not be a problem.

451
00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:09,685
With all due respect. If you are alone, it would be different.

452
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:11,593
I'm just saying it.

453
00:38:11,595 --> 00:38:16,692
And I must admit, to our incredible launch bullet train.

454
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:21,602
It will take you where you need to go, with extraordinary speed.

455
00:38:21,638 --> 00:38:25,597
The future is open officially.

456
00:38:44,761 --> 00:38:46,786
Wait, stop the car.

457
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:48,696
What?

458
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:52,563
The carriage drove in the wrong direction.

459
00:38:52,669 --> 00:38:55,763
- It drove backwards. - I'm going after him.

460
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:05,775
The train was almost overtaken. 180 and still rising. How quickly created.

461
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,778
About 25 miles.

462
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:17,593
No one can stop this train and help.

463
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:19,755
It's okay. Do not go.

464
00:39:20,764 --> 00:39:23,562
What it Elastigirl?

465
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:27,735
Caution!

466
00:39:29,673 --> 00:39:33,575
- Reset! - They block the system.

467
00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:41,807
- We will fail to save. - Not enough time.

468
00:39:44,654 --> 00:39:48,556
- Someone call? Who? - Hey, mom, I could not find socks,

469
00:39:48,592 --> 00:39:51,584
And he could not find his toys. We'll call you again.

470
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:53,586
- So, calm down. - Do not call your mother.

471
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,565
Allright darling. Can not talk right now. But check under your bed, right?

472
00:39:56,566 --> 00:39:58,761
- How much time? - Approximately 2 minutes.

473
00:39:58,802 --> 00:40:02,636
There is a shortcut, cut to the front end.

474
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:11,673
I do not know if I can catch him.

475
00:40:35,805 --> 00:40:37,773
Come on!

476
00:42:19,743 --> 00:42:21,734
What the hell?

477
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:25,579
Everything is alright? There are people injured? Are you alright?

478
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:31,645
Nice story better!

479
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:35,681
- Hi? Hi? - What happened?

480
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:43,825
Welcome back, Elastigirl. Rapta-pantallas.

481
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:13,729
- Honey, why are you? - Do not say anything.

482
00:43:17,534 --> 00:43:20,628
- It's dad. Are you alright? - I am fine.

483
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:24,572
- I do not want to talk about this. - You did not go?

484
00:43:24,607 --> 00:43:27,804
- I do not want to talk about it. Father. - Oh dear.

485
00:43:27,844 --> 00:43:33,680
Go away from here, not better. Leave me alone. Please.

486
00:43:34,784 --> 00:43:38,720
That's my brother, this burger.

487
00:43:38,755 --> 00:43:41,724
I feel you are more mature, Roy.

488
00:43:41,758 --> 00:43:44,818
Because you're extraordinary.

489
00:43:47,664 --> 00:43:52,567
Raise your hand, raise your hand. Put your hands behind your head.

490
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:56,663
You too, miss it. And come here.

491
00:43:57,607 --> 00:43:59,541
Note the door.

492
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:01,737
And then I change ...

493
00:44:04,547 --> 00:44:06,640
Now.

494
00:44:08,685 --> 00:44:11,654
I'm telling you now.

495
00:44:11,821 --> 00:44:13,812
Come on!

496
00:45:51,554 --> 00:45:54,523
No, no, no, no, no!

497
00:45:56,593 --> 00:45:58,720
No!

498
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:01,787
No, no!

499
00:46:01,798 --> 00:46:07,566
No, no, no! No, no! No, no!

500
00:46:14,544 --> 00:46:21,643
You have the power! Yes! Baby, no injuries to you!

501
00:46:21,651 --> 00:46:25,519
I thought you did not have, you have the power.

502
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:30,753
You can multiply and penetrate any hard.

503
00:46:34,631 --> 00:46:37,657
Oh, my God.

504
00:46:41,804 --> 00:46:44,602
- Hello. - Hi, dear. You'll call me?

505
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:52,741
I'm fine, do not. I mean, yes, yes. I just ... weird thing just happened in the yard.

506
00:46:52,749 --> 00:46:56,708
- Sounded like he woke. - No, no, it's just, Jack-Jack.

507
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:59,517
He was in an accident, I know. I'm home now. I know.

508
00:46:59,555 --> 00:47:02,683
No, no, no. There are no accidents. Remained there, it is your mission.

509
00:47:02,692 --> 00:47:05,752
And you never, should, should, what? You do not think I could do it?

510
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:08,821
I'm sorry, I was overcharged.

511
00:47:08,831 --> 00:47:12,528
- What do you need me to go home? - No, no. No. I was able to.

512
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:15,560
- Everything is fine. - What happened to Jack-Jack.

513
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:20,633
- No, he helps all. - That's good.

514
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:27,616
- What about Violet? Tonight, right? - Oh, yes. Yes. Good.

515
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:31,609
Everything was good, good. And Jack-Jack to sleep? Without any problems?

516
00:47:31,654 --> 00:47:33,588
Okay, no problem.

517
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:34,783
And Dash finish homework?

518
00:47:34,824 --> 00:47:38,658
- Everything is finished. - So it was not out of control when I go?

519
00:47:38,695 --> 00:47:43,530
Exceptional as it looks, it's nice. In fact.

520
00:47:43,566 --> 00:47:44,760
How about you?

521
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:47,736
I think it's incredible all!

522
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:52,706
That's fantastic. The mayor stuck in the car ...

523
00:47:52,742 --> 00:47:55,711
In the opening ceremony, Elastigirl save the mayor ...

524
00:47:55,712 --> 00:48:02,584
Activated, bla-bla-bla ... A few words and then the train began moving backwards,

525
00:48:02,585 --> 00:48:05,713
- Then ... - new car crash tragedy ...

526
00:48:05,722 --> 00:48:09,522
For Elastigirl, almost all superheroes.

527
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,720
Elastigirl...Elastigirl...

528
00:48:11,728 --> 00:48:14,561
There were no casualties.

529
00:48:14,564 --> 00:48:16,691
Using a motor ...

530
00:48:17,834 --> 00:48:21,668
And I pursue it, I tell dear, it was extraordinary.

531
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:25,698
That's unusual, unfortunately. On the first night of yours, dear.

532
00:48:25,742 --> 00:48:30,679
- I'm so proud of you. Very. - I'm proud of you, honey.

533
00:48:30,713 --> 00:48:35,616
I know you want to get out there, and you will soon, either. You will be enormous.

534
00:48:35,618 --> 00:48:37,779
I could not do it if you do not take very good experts.

535
00:48:37,787 --> 00:48:41,621
- Thank you to handle everything. - It is nothing.

536
00:48:41,624 --> 00:48:44,684
I love you, dear. I'll be home soon.

537
00:48:44,694 --> 00:48:47,754
- Sweet dream. - Sweet dreams, dear.

538
00:49:02,545 --> 00:49:06,572
Oh, is completed. Please, dad. It is okay.

539
00:49:06,582 --> 00:49:09,551
I'll wait for the mother.

540
00:49:09,585 --> 00:49:12,782
In secret, I know ...

541
00:49:12,822 --> 00:49:15,723
I can do the math.

542
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:28,635
Oh, not good at all.

543
00:49:29,572 --> 00:49:35,670
Command weak, am I too weak?

544
00:49:37,613 --> 00:49:40,776
It's not my fault they changed the math.

545
00:49:47,824 --> 00:49:50,588
Get up, baby.

546
00:49:50,593 --> 00:49:53,562
I do not like to disturb your sleep.

547
00:49:53,563 --> 00:49:56,726
Do you still want to continue to sleep?

548
00:49:56,766 --> 00:50:01,760
You have to remember it all.

549
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:05,700
Calculate the formula correctly.

550
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:09,769
You understand? You're terrific.

551
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:24,760
Oh. Hello.

552
00:50:24,794 --> 00:50:29,629
Where is your house? I wrote a message in your locker.

553
00:50:29,665 --> 00:50:31,656
With permanent ink.

554
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:33,692
Oh, what's that?

555
00:50:33,703 --> 00:50:36,638
- Did you forget? - Forget?

556
00:50:36,672 --> 00:50:38,799
What?

557
00:50:39,642 --> 00:50:42,611
That's funny.

558
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,707
Very funny. Oh, what for a strange costume?

559
00:50:48,718 --> 00:50:52,552
Because there is, I'm in a hurry ...

560
00:50:52,555 --> 00:50:58,619
and it was like Shakespeare, but not similar. The kids thought it was a super hero costume.

561
00:50:58,661 --> 00:50:59,787
- Children love super heroes. - Yes.

562
00:50:59,795 --> 00:51:03,595
You want to wear something, but too tight and could not.

563
00:51:03,633 --> 00:51:07,831
Do I know you?

564
00:51:14,644 --> 00:51:16,703
The topic of conversation these days is lncredibles.

565
00:51:16,712 --> 00:51:20,671
Sorry, I do not really like to talk about it.

566
00:51:20,683 --> 00:51:22,742
Maybe they did not.

567
00:51:22,785 --> 00:51:24,719
I have not been putting on my face.

568
00:51:24,754 --> 00:51:27,587
This is good, I train you on this momentum.

569
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:30,753
Get out and be yourself and answer appropriately.

570
00:51:30,793 --> 00:51:33,591
Ms. Elastic Girl, they're ready for you.

571
00:51:33,596 --> 00:51:37,532
Hey, folding legs.

572
00:51:38,701 --> 00:51:41,670
thanks.

573
00:51:41,671 --> 00:51:44,572
- Hurry. - Wait ... wow!

574
00:51:44,607 --> 00:51:47,804
You are Elastic Girl! I'm shook hands.

575
00:51:47,843 --> 00:51:50,641
Oh, I was so sad when you disappeared.

576
00:51:50,646 --> 00:51:52,705
I'm glad you're back!

577
00:51:52,715 --> 00:51:53,773
With a great costume.

578
00:51:53,816 --> 00:51:57,718
- It means a lot to me. - Good luck with your speech.

579
00:51:57,753 --> 00:52:02,554
- I hope you're at peace. - Of course. Opponent crime!

580
00:52:02,558 --> 00:52:03,650
Okay.

581
00:52:03,693 --> 00:52:06,560
Three, two ...

582
00:52:06,562 --> 00:52:09,531
For more than 15 years, superheroes in hiding.

583
00:52:09,565 --> 00:52:12,659
Forced to do so, because they lost the support.

584
00:52:12,668 --> 00:52:16,695
That may soon change due to the movement to restore superheroes.

585
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:21,699
Here was present heroes who save the train and with a new look.

586
00:52:21,744 --> 00:52:23,769
Pahlawan super, Elastic Girl.

587
00:52:23,779 --> 00:52:25,576
- Welcome. - Hello, Jed.

588
00:52:25,614 --> 00:52:27,639
All the attention was focused on you.

589
00:52:27,683 --> 00:52:28,775
Correct. Did you know?

590
00:52:28,784 --> 00:52:31,548
Of course.

591
00:52:31,554 --> 00:52:34,580
- Hello. - What do I get perhartianmu?

592
00:52:34,623 --> 00:52:35,715
Ya, Jed.

593
00:52:35,725 --> 00:52:38,751
Of course, I appeared on your screen.

594
00:52:38,761 --> 00:52:41,787
Read the words to say on the other screen.

595
00:52:41,797 --> 00:52:46,791
Screens are everywhere and we controlled all of it.

596
00:52:46,802 --> 00:52:51,705
And display control myself.

597
00:52:51,707 --> 00:52:53,607
Human control screen.

598
00:52:53,642 --> 00:52:56,611
- Hey! - I who control everything.

599
00:52:56,612 --> 00:52:59,638
Angry reactions that occur in front of you.

600
00:52:59,682 --> 00:53:01,616
- What about him? - The signals are hijacked!

601
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,709
- I'm going to close it. - Do not look at the monitor.

602
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:06,586
I just hijack the signal, they are fine.

603
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:11,720
I'm still at the top, right, Elastic Girl?

604
00:53:11,761 --> 00:53:14,787
- Whoa! - Where is the window ...?

605
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:17,697
There.

606
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:29,635
- What happened? - That Elastic Girl!

607
00:53:29,645 --> 00:53:32,671
What is he doing?

608
00:53:40,689 --> 00:53:45,683
- What are you doing here? - This place is dangerous. Caution!

609
00:53:46,662 --> 00:53:49,756
Follow them on!

610
00:53:51,734 --> 00:53:55,761
Get away from there! I'm going to jump!

611
00:54:03,813 --> 00:54:06,748
Stop it! That Elastic Girl.

612
00:54:06,749 --> 00:54:10,515
I'm saving your town, Mom!

613
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:20,752
We are under attack! Protect minister!

614
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:27,658
- Open the door! - That's dangerous!

615
00:54:27,837 --> 00:54:31,705
You all, jump!

616
00:54:48,691 --> 00:54:51,558
Caution!

617
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:55,655
We're going to fall!

618
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:04,567
Are you okay, Mom?

619
00:55:04,573 --> 00:55:07,565
I am alright...

620
00:55:15,818 --> 00:55:18,719
Yours is not tasty cakes.

621
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:21,781
- Good morning. - You saw me in that costume ...

622
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:25,726
and pretend to know me.

623
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:28,594
I was just trying to protect you.

624
00:55:28,597 --> 00:55:30,690
She really see you there.

625
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:37,605
That's up to you, I can not tell how many memories I have.

626
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:41,701
Someone knows the identity of your mother and me.

627
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:44,770
I see you! Did you tell them about Tony!

628
00:55:44,813 --> 00:55:50,581
- Dear. - You're ruining my life!

629
00:56:01,764 --> 00:56:03,664
I hate super hero!

630
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:08,660
And I'm not going to wear it again!

631
00:56:11,774 --> 00:56:15,642
I'll tear it up!

632
00:56:22,685 --> 00:56:25,779
What can I learn math?

633
00:56:25,821 --> 00:56:29,621
It seems that yesterday's incident was terrible ... '' Elastic Girl save the minister. ''

634
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:32,594
there has been a strike yesterday to the minister.

635
00:56:32,628 --> 00:56:34,653
What's up now? Why abounded.

636
00:56:34,663 --> 00:56:36,631
They came to offer support.

637
00:56:36,632 --> 00:56:39,499
Support? Support for what?

638
00:56:39,568 --> 00:56:43,732
Support to you.

639
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:46,674
Come on out, we all support you!

640
00:56:46,709 --> 00:56:49,576
Hello! Is.

00:56:49,578 --> 00:56:51,773
Oh, thank you very much.

642
00:56:51,814 --> 00:56:58,583
Hello. What is written there?

643
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,585
Oh, I see you! Ellen Wood.

644
00:57:06,595 --> 00:57:09,655
Oh, now you're returning my calls about superheroes?

645
00:57:09,665 --> 00:57:12,657
Oh, I have to call you back. My God, you're great.

646
00:57:12,701 --> 00:57:13,793
Hold all the phone for me.

647
00:57:13,836 --> 00:57:15,770
Hey! It worked!

648
00:57:15,771 --> 00:57:19,571
Hey, ministers make great speeches about super heroes today.

649
00:57:19,575 --> 00:57:21,668
You saved a lot of lives and she is very happy.

650
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:24,736
Who would expect it? I got a lot of calls.

651
00:57:24,747 --> 00:57:27,648
Increased media attention 720/0

652
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:31,643
The urge to legalize the super hero into a global movement!

653
00:57:31,687 --> 00:57:33,655
I had big plans for the next.

654
00:57:33,656 --> 00:57:35,556
We will hold a press conference at sea.

655
00:57:35,591 --> 00:57:39,721
We will use the ship and sail the sea while ...

656
00:57:39,728 --> 00:57:42,629
It's true. I'm happy.

657
00:57:42,631 --> 00:57:46,761
I'm happy to have saved the lives of people and the minister proud of me.

658
00:57:46,802 --> 00:57:48,736
And I'm glad you're happy.

659
00:57:48,737 --> 00:57:51,763
I heard that you were happy, but why I do not feel like it?

660
00:57:51,774 --> 00:57:54,743
Because I did not catch it. He's still out there.

661
00:57:54,777 --> 00:57:57,769
All I did was follow the game and win in this round.

662
00:57:57,813 --> 00:58:01,681
He will want it again and when he plays, he always wins!

663
00:58:01,684 --> 00:58:05,552
One thing I learned in business that is sniffing flowers.

664
00:58:05,587 --> 00:58:08,556
Everything is in bloom and where would you put on a stone nisanmu?

665
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:10,558
- He's too worried? - OK.

666
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,791
Stop talking. Show him.

667
00:58:23,572 --> 00:58:24,800
Wow.

668
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:28,571
Wow! Elastic Girl. You are here.

669
00:58:28,577 --> 00:58:30,704

I bring it here, they are hiding.

681
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:16,557
Their strength, the secret identity, all transferred.

682
00:59:16,592 --> 00:59:21,757
A pleasure to meet. I always thought the greatest.

683
00:59:21,764 --> 00:59:23,755
Well, thank cation. You are so kind.

684
00:59:23,799 --> 00:59:27,701

You know, dropping objects electricity.

688
00:59:36,645 --> 00:59:38,704
Assemble and unleash the power of lightning.

689
00:59:38,747 --> 00:59:43,650
I Reflux. I can be anything you decide.

690
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:46,621
I know you're very excited.

691
00:59:46,655 --> 00:59:48,714
- Just say it. - Oh, I'm not busy.

692
00:59:48,724 --> 00:59:51,693
Forget it.

693
00:59:53,762 --> 00:59:58,631
Yes, it was amazing. Come back.

694
00:59:58,634 --> 01:00:01,569
So...

695
01:00:02,704 --> 01:00:06,538
Well, congratulations on this great day.

696
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:09,807
Good night all. See you tomorrow.

697
01:00:09,845 --> 01:00:11,642

698
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:14,616
- You're wearing the pants in this time? - Of course.

699
01:00:14,616 --> 01:00:17,676
Well, it's been a while since you did ...

700
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:20,745
and even then you are under its shadow.

701
01:00:20,756 --> 01:00:22,519
Yes, I feel differently.

702
01:00:22,558 --> 01:00:26,585
I did not mean it. You're very successful and you're the star.

703
01:00:26,628 --> 01:00:31,691
But you have to talk about it. This is your house.

704
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,726
- You need to fix your attitude. - What are you doing?

705
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:37,739
- You're not better. - I do not want his work.

706
01:00:37,773 --> 01:00:40,765
I can not do that to you.

707
01:00:40,776 --> 01:00:43,711
I'm asking you, the rooms where the most intense?

708
01:00:43,745 --> 01:00:46,714
You never entered, it must be clean.

709
01:00:46,748 --> 01:00:47,715
Beautiful scenery?

710
01:00:47,749 --> 01:00:51,810
That will affect turnover as more and more buyers.

711
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:55,654
Whatever you are selling nothing. Who penging what people buy?

712
01:00:55,657 --> 01:00:59,559
It's true. If I find the origin of the universe.

713
01:00:59,595 --> 01:01:03,827
My sister will look for ways to approach it. Perhaps with foot massage.

714
01:01:06,568 --> 01:01:07,728
So, what do they say?

715
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:10,704
They will tell you to get ready.

716
01:01:10,706 --> 01:01:14,642
They will wait for permission and the preceding first.

717
01:01:14,643 --> 01:01:15,803
- Looks like it was my brother. - What?

718
01:01:15,844 --> 01:01:17,607
You sound like my brother.

719
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:21,549
Well, he's not wrong. We're not going to get a reaction.

720
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:22,710
- I know how! - My older brother?

721
01:01:22,751 --> 01:01:24,810
What? Not! The movement!

722
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:28,722
Send him a message and I'll try to track it.

723
01:01:28,757 --> 01:01:31,555
How fast can you get to the airport?

724
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,551
- OK. - We should get out of this town.

725
01:01:33,562 --> 01:01:35,621
I will be prepared tomorrow morning at 5.

726
01:01:35,664 --> 01:01:37,529
Insert it into the television. Jed!

727
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:39,625
I will make my brother do a live broadcast tomorrow ...

728
01:01:39,635 --> 01:01:40,602
with a news event!

729
01:01:40,636 --> 01:01:42,604
- We'll trap her! - He will not tell!

730
01:01:42,638 --> 01:01:43,832
Movement of the hero will succeed!

731
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:48,572
Tonight!

732
01:01:50,646 --> 01:01:51,704
- Who is this? - Yeah, hey Rick.

733
01:01:51,747 --> 01:01:54,648
Do you remember the child who never told you?

734
01:01:54,683 --> 01:01:56,617
Yes, what is up? He's a good kid.

735
01:01:56,652 --> 01:02:00,554
Well, he also deals with my daughter.

736
01:02:00,556 --> 01:02:02,615
Actually you harm my daughter.

737
01:02:02,658 --> 01:02:04,751
Oh, shit. I did not know about that.

738
01:02:04,793 --> 01:02:06,693
Rick, you have to help.

739
01:02:06,728 --> 01:02:09,754
Violet hates me, you and superheroes.

740
01:02:09,765 --> 01:02:13,758
I have to fix this. What do you know about Tony?

741
01:02:13,802 --> 01:02:16,771
Not much. Looks like he's a good kid.

742
01:02:16,772 --> 01:02:20,799
She loves music and sports. His parents happy.

743
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:22,777
These children work part-time.

744
01:02:22,811 --> 01:02:26,804
Of Happy Platter?

745
01:02:27,749 --> 01:02:32,550
Why are we the way here and eat at Happy Platter?

746
01:02:32,554 --> 01:02:33,748
We would like to reserve a table is there.

747
01:02:33,755 --> 01:02:39,557
Near the plant. Nice is not, close the plant.

748
01:02:40,596 --> 01:02:43,565
This place does not look so fun.

749
01:02:43,565 --> 01:02:45,658
The place is rather dull.

750
01:02:45,701 --> 01:02:47,566
Boring.

751
01:02:47,569 --> 01:02:50,629
I thought you wanted to change our course.

752
01:02:50,672 --> 01:02:54,608
- I like the food was outstanding. - That's not good.

753
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:58,740
That all diet foods and all vegetables.

754
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,806
Good evening, everybody.

755
01:03:01,817 --> 01:03:04,684
- What is wrong with you? - Do not you anything?

756
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,747
- Let me help you ... - He was surprised.

757
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:12,556
Normally she was never like that.

758
01:03:12,594 --> 01:03:14,619
- Do you want water, sir? - Yes.

759
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:18,657
A glass of water. This is my daughter, you know him?

760
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:19,792
- Halo.- Violet.

761
01:03:19,835 --> 01:03:22,668
Halo, Violet.

762
01:03:22,671 --> 01:03:23,797
Hey, say hi to the ...

763
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:27,536
- Do not be too pushy, father. - How are you?

764
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:29,510
Halo.

765
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:32,536
This drink is delicious.

766
01:03:32,581 --> 01:03:35,812
- Water What is this? - I do not know, the tap water.

767
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:40,720
- Very delicious. - Extraordinary.

768
01:03:41,757 --> 01:03:43,588
Nice to meet you.

769
01:03:43,592 --> 01:03:44,752
Where is he going?

770
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,752
Finding a place to go berserk?

771
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:51,788
Hi, we will conduct a special interview with Elastic Girl.

772
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:54,597
How are you, Jed? Do not you anything?

773
01:03:54,603 --> 01:03:56,696
I am fine. Doctors have examined me.

774
01:03:56,738 --> 01:03:58,797
I do not remember what happened.

775
01:03:58,807 --> 01:04:02,800
I must tell you, strange to experience the event.

776
01:04:02,811 --> 01:04:04,779
I do not remember.

777
01:04:04,813 --> 01:04:08,806
I ask that everyone not to worry.

778
01:04:08,817 --> 01:04:09,784
Where are you now?

779
01:04:09,818 --> 01:04:13,549
I was in a cave that is very safe.

780
01:04:13,588 --> 01:04:17,649
I want to talk to you, starting with a rescue train recording.

781
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:22,790
This is the original footage of the action beranimu.

782
01:04:22,831 --> 01:04:28,531
We have to save him before the train crashed!

783
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:31,539
25 miles away. Guavaberry

784
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:36,637
I will do an important announcement at this event.

785
01:04:36,678 --> 01:04:39,545
- He knows. - The mechanism worked.

786
01:04:39,581 --> 01:04:42,550
- No need to look for the source. - Gotcha!

787
01:04:42,551 --> 01:04:48,547
You will not be able to find it. I could not be found.

788
01:04:48,557 --> 01:04:56,521
And when you are aware, I've been in a place far away.

789
01:04:56,531 --> 01:05:02,697
Superheroes are creatures who must be destroyed.

790
01:05:02,738 --> 01:05:09,576
They do not show their real face.

791
01:05:09,611 --> 01:05:12,774
They're just pretending to be a hero,

792
01:05:12,781 --> 01:05:18,742
every action they do to deceive you.

793
01:05:18,787 --> 01:05:28,753
All their crimes hidden behind their masks.

794
01:05:28,764 --> 01:05:32,791
As the disease in the human body.

795
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:39,730
You think they protect you, in fact you have been made weak.

796
01:05:39,775 --> 01:05:43,541
I tell this so their cover blown.

797
01:05:43,545 --> 01:05:48,642
And everything can be saved from their deceit.

798
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:54,679
The existing system has made a big mistake.

799
01:05:54,723 --> 01:06:02,653
Destroy all of the existing system and try to stop me.

800
01:06:02,664 --> 01:06:09,536
You're no longer in control. I who control everything.

801
01:07:48,703 --> 01:07:52,799
I see you.

802
01:08:41,623 --> 01:08:43,682
Sorry!

803
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:15,713
What happened?

804
01:09:15,757 --> 01:09:18,817
You ruined my proof!

805
01:09:18,827 --> 01:09:20,795
What is this? What do I do?

806
01:09:20,795 --> 01:09:25,732
- You can not do this! - Right, just blame the system!

807
01:09:25,767 --> 01:09:28,668
Jebakanmu succeed, you're a genius.

808
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:32,662
Oh, come on. I'm just a genius behind the genius.

809
01:09:32,674 --> 01:09:34,539
The latest news today ...

810
01:09:34,576 --> 01:09:39,570
Dad, what we will do this formula?

811
01:09:39,581 --> 01:09:40,513
Come ask me.

812
01:09:40,548 --> 01:09:42,675
Do not you ... Are not you tired?

813
01:09:42,684 --> 01:09:49,522
Now we have to learn more.

814
01:09:49,557 --> 01:09:54,620
A car driven by a super hero.

815
01:09:54,662 --> 01:09:57,631
I bought it when the auction.

816
01:09:57,632 --> 01:09:58,826
They said the car was destroyed.

817
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:00,801
Hey, the car in good condition.

818
01:10:00,802 --> 01:10:02,736
You used to have that car?

819
01:10:02,771 --> 01:10:04,636
They said the car was destroyed.

820
01:10:04,672 --> 01:10:08,574
This famous car will be auctioned.

821
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:12,774
That is ... That's my car!

822
01:10:22,557 --> 01:10:25,583
You're going to fill it with advanced equipment.

823
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:27,618
- Is it true? - I like this car.

824
01:10:27,662 --> 01:10:31,564
But it will take a long time.

825
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:35,635
Wow! His car is on fire!

826
01:10:36,538 --> 01:10:37,596
Hah?

827
01:10:37,605 --> 01:10:39,766
What are you doing? It's not a toy!

828
01:10:39,774 --> 01:10:41,639
That is the rocket launcher!

829
01:10:41,676 --> 01:10:43,576
Wait, we have to launch a rocket.

830
01:10:43,611 --> 01:10:44,771
Hey, it's not your car.

831
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:46,542
It's also not a car.

832
01:10:46,548 --> 01:10:47,776
That's my car. That's mine.

833
01:10:47,782 --> 01:10:49,647
Why is that person who has it?

834
01:10:49,684 --> 01:10:51,709
- He does not have it. - Launch a rocket.

835
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:52,708
Launch rocket!

836
01:10:52,754 --> 01:10:54,585
We're not going to launch anything.

837
01:10:54,622 --> 01:10:59,650
Do you think I want them to come to me now, when I try to not ...

838
01:10:59,661 --> 01:11:01,822
distract.

839
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:07,635
Shit.

840
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:13,735
So you're not going to steal your car back?

841
01:11:27,555 --> 01:11:28,783
Jack-Jack has the power?

842
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,781
- Correct. - You know about this?

843
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:32,759
- Yes. - Why did not you tell us?

844
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,786
- I know. - We are your children. We are entitled to know.

845
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:37,559
- You tell mom? - No.

846
01:11:37,565 --> 01:11:40,591
- Why not? - Your mother was not happy to hear it.

847
01:11:40,602 --> 01:11:42,661
Why are we not going to tell her?

848
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:43,637
- What? - Because, it can not.

849
01:11:43,671 --> 01:11:44,763
- Come on, man. - Why?

850
01:11:44,772 --> 01:11:46,672
- Because ... - Really not cool.

851
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,801
Because I'm thinking about it. Okay?

852
01:11:48,843 --> 01:11:51,744
I accepted the information and are currently processing it.

853
01:11:51,746 --> 01:11:56,683
I tried to fix it and try to prevent the baby into a flaming monster.

854
01:11:56,684 --> 01:11:58,709
How do I do that?

855
01:11:58,753 --> 01:12:03,690
By accepting all the mischief, okay?

856
01:12:03,725 --> 01:12:08,788
Because I'm Mr. lncredible, not Mr. Soap, or Mr. Milk.

857
01:12:08,796 --> 01:12:12,755
Mr. lncredible.

858
01:12:13,701 --> 01:12:15,601
Gosh.

859
01:12:15,637 --> 01:12:20,665
No, I can handle it. There's no way I'm going to ...

860
01:12:30,818 --> 01:12:34,652
I will contact Lucius.

861
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:39,524
Look normal to me. Since when did this happen?

862
01:12:39,561 --> 01:12:41,529
Since Helen got the job.

863
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:42,518
I assume he knows it.

864
01:12:42,564 --> 01:12:44,623
Are you kidding? I could not tell him about this.

865
01:12:44,666 --> 01:12:46,531
Not as long as he did the work of heroes.

866
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:49,833
LBU.

867
01:12:51,673 --> 01:12:54,767
I must succeed so that he could succeed.

868
01:12:54,809 --> 01:12:56,709
For us to succeed.

869
01:12:56,711 --> 01:12:58,770
I understand, Bob. I understand.

870
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,577
When was the last time you slept?

871
01:13:00,615 --> 01:13:05,780
No need to be exaggerated. I can handle this.

872
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,549
So...

873
01:13:07,555 --> 01:13:08,579
then you okay?

874
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:11,718
You can overcome this situation, is not it?

875
01:13:13,628 --> 01:13:15,562
What ...

876
01:13:15,563 --> 01:13:17,793
Okay, time for cake.

877
01:13:17,832 --> 01:13:22,633
Delicious cake.

878
01:13:22,637 --> 01:13:23,729
Cake.

879
01:13:23,738 --> 01:13:27,765
- You can not ... - Cake ...

880
01:13:30,678 --> 01:13:31,736
He had just ...

881
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:34,543
Coming from another dimension. Correct.

882
01:13:34,549 --> 01:13:35,811
It was really creepy. And it was not ...

883
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:39,650
Not good. I know.

884
01:13:39,654 --> 01:13:41,781
Power will increase. And we can not control it.

885
01:13:41,789 --> 01:13:44,553
So, what ... what do you succeed?

886
01:13:44,592 --> 01:13:46,617
Yes. You think so, do not you?

887
01:13:46,628 --> 01:13:50,564
Obviously, I can not keep giving her cakes.

888
01:13:50,598 --> 01:13:52,828
But if I stop ...

889
01:13:57,538 --> 01:14:01,599
I can not bite. I can not bite.

890
01:14:06,648 --> 01:14:08,639
All right.

891
01:14:09,617 --> 01:14:12,586
I think I need time for myself.

892
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:13,678
Then I'll be able to finish this.

893
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:15,814
You need more than just that, Bob.

894
01:14:15,823 --> 01:14:21,693
You need plenty of time to finish this. Starting from this weird super baby.

895
01:14:21,729 --> 01:14:26,757
You need to start thinking about something unusual.

896
01:14:34,609 --> 01:14:40,570
You dare to appear in front of me like that without cleaning it first?

897
01:14:40,581 --> 01:14:42,776
Clean yourself.

898
01:14:44,752 --> 01:14:47,619
Bob, are you bringing anyone?

899
01:14:47,622 --> 01:14:48,748
Only the baby alone.

900
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:52,521
I took my baby.

901
01:14:52,593 --> 01:14:55,653
Really unusual.

902
01:15:01,703 --> 01:15:04,797
You look absolutely terrible.

903
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,571
I ruined my car.

904
01:15:07,608 --> 01:15:15,640
Then he hit me, and now he's changing.

905
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:19,711
I do not know what else to do.

906
01:15:19,754 --> 01:15:20,812
I'm really tired.

907
01:15:20,822 --> 01:15:24,758
If done correctly, being a parent is a heroic act.

908
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:26,657
If done properly.

909
01:15:26,661 --> 01:15:29,721
And fortunately, you know me.

910
01:15:29,764 --> 01:15:33,723
If you do not come to me, then you will be destroyed.

911
01:15:33,735 --> 01:15:38,570
I've been designing clothes the hero, for your son.

912
01:15:38,606 --> 01:15:40,665
Actually it was for Jack-Jack.

913
01:15:40,675 --> 01:15:43,542
You also want me to make clothes for the baby?

914
01:15:43,578 --> 01:15:46,775
I would not regard this as one of the emergency.

915
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:52,549
Well, you'll never know until I left it here for a while.

916
01:15:52,587 --> 01:15:55,647
Leave it? Here?

917
01:15:55,656 --> 01:16:00,593
I'm not a babysitter. I'm an artist.

918
01:16:00,628 --> 01:16:04,758
I'm good at making clothes.

919
01:16:12,807 --> 01:16:16,641
Did you see this?

920
01:16:28,623 --> 01:16:30,750
Gosh.

921
01:16:30,758 --> 01:16:32,623
Ya.

922
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:39,623
Glad you came to this heavy task, because I like to challenge myself.

923
01:16:39,634 --> 01:16:44,799
And I'll take care of it properly, so you will see the changes later.

924
01:16:46,741 --> 01:16:49,767
Edna become parents?

925
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:55,647
Attention, attention.

926
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:57,743
I want to thank all the people who have come here tonight ...

927
01:16:57,785 --> 01:17:02,779
in order to support these heroes and encourage them to return to society.

928
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,621
You who make all of this happen.

929
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:13,727
While I only intercede you desire to achieve this.

930
01:17:13,734 --> 01:17:16,601
I think of him as someone special.

931
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:18,605
You love it, you miss him.

932
01:17:18,606 --> 01:17:22,542
Meet Elastigirl.

933
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:23,599
Go on up here.

934
01:17:23,611 --> 01:17:27,638
Better yet, show yourself here.

935
01:17:27,648 --> 01:17:30,583
I want you to have this.

936
01:17:30,618 --> 01:17:31,778
A keepsake.

937
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:35,687
Thank you, Winston, Evelyn, and all the people who are here.

938
01:17:35,723 --> 01:17:37,657
I'm flattered.

939
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:42,618
And to all of you. It's thanks to you guys.

940
01:17:42,663 --> 01:17:48,533
We only had a short time, which makes me want to announce something important.

941
01:17:48,569 --> 01:17:55,771
Just now, the World Meeting led by hundreds of world leaders agreeing to be a hero ...

942
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:58,677
reappear.

943
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:07,646
Look, all leaders on this earth are to hold a meeting on the ship.

944
01:18:07,655 --> 01:18:12,683
If you permit, we would attend.

945
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:18,722
As ...

946
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:22,566
There is something to ask of you first.

947
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:26,802
How can you split time between being a hero and an ordinary person?

948
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:35,640
Oh, could you briefly delay?

949
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:39,518
Yes, see you again.

950
01:18:59,574 --> 01:19:02,668
- Hey, baby. - Hey.

951
01:19:02,677 --> 01:19:05,578
- Where is Jack-Jack? - He's staying at home ...

952
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,639
- Edna become a nanny? - True.

953
01:19:07,682 --> 01:19:09,775
And you do not object to this?

954
01:19:09,784 --> 01:19:13,618
Yes. I do not mind.

955
01:19:14,622 --> 01:19:17,785
I want to tell you something.

956
01:19:18,559 --> 01:19:20,720
Sorry about Tommy.

957
01:19:20,761 --> 01:19:25,664
I do not think to erase his memory, you will pay the consequence ...

958
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:29,602
of choices you never do. That's not fair.

959
01:19:29,637 --> 01:19:31,537
I know.

960
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:34,667
And then I made it worse in the restaurant with trying to ...

961
01:19:34,709 --> 01:19:36,677
Whatever it is, whatever it is ...

962
01:19:36,711 --> 01:19:38,645
Forgive me.

963
01:19:38,646 --> 01:19:41,740
I always knew what the right thing to do.

964
01:19:41,782 --> 01:19:45,513
But now, I'm not sure anymore.

965
01:19:45,553 --> 01:19:48,647
I just want to be ...

966
01:19:49,624 --> 01:19:51,785
a good father.

967
01:19:54,762 --> 01:19:57,788
You're not a good father.

968
01:19:58,766 --> 01:20:01,667
You're a super dad.

969
01:20:10,578 --> 01:20:12,773
What heroes are allowed to drink while on duty?

970
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:15,749
I'm not on duty. Just ignore this costume.

971
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:20,653
I knew I should be up there, but I do not really like crowds.

972
01:20:20,688 --> 01:20:23,748
You must be alone to keep the spirit. I know I am.

973
01:20:23,758 --> 01:20:25,623
You're running from?

974
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:27,651
Well, you know, a problem the company.

975
01:20:27,662 --> 01:20:28,686
But mostly my brother.

976
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:31,789
But you love him. You guys are the motor of this company. Yin and Yang.

977
01:20:31,799 --> 01:20:34,666
Correct. I know it. He was great with communication.

978
01:20:34,702 --> 01:20:38,763
Make them happy, welcome them, listen to what they want.

979
01:20:38,773 --> 01:20:41,503
I never know what people want.

980
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:43,567
What do you want them?

981
01:20:43,611 --> 01:20:47,638
Ease. People will redeem quality with ease, every time.

982
01:20:47,682 --> 01:20:50,674
That might not be bad, but hey, it's easy.

983
01:20:50,685 --> 01:20:52,585
I have no idea.

984
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:55,646
- You got a problem? - Yes, there is something.

985
01:20:55,656 --> 01:20:57,521
That's too easy.

986
01:20:57,558 --> 01:21:00,584
It's too easy?

987
01:21:00,695 --> 01:21:01,821
- Anything?

988
01:21:01,829 --> 01:21:03,797
What is that?

989
01:21:03,831 --> 01:21:09,633
One monitor that it is a camera flashes.

990
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:12,663
Is not closed bersirkuit camera?

991
01:21:12,673 --> 01:21:15,733
- Correct. - If so, how do they have it?

992
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,641
Maybe they meretasnya.

993
01:21:17,678 --> 01:21:22,741
So security is really sophisticated, but the door was only locked simple?

994
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,718
Maybe he wants you to know.

995
01:21:24,752 --> 01:21:26,583
He wants to get caught?

996
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:29,680
- He wants you to win. - That's absurd.

997
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:33,683
He's an intelligent man. There was no way he was not aware of such technology.

998
01:21:33,694 --> 01:21:36,629
He's smart enough to do something with it.

999
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:38,598
People that we put people in jail is not arbitrary.

1000
01:21:38,632 --> 01:21:40,725
So? I see him as a loser

1001
01:21:40,735 --> 01:21:43,533
Look, you win. You've got ...

1002
01:21:43,571 --> 01:21:44,538
Wait!

1003
01:21:44,572 --> 01:21:46,767
He must do to hypnotize someone

1004
01:21:46,774 --> 01:21:49,538
is to make their eyes fixed on the screen.

1005
01:21:49,577 --> 01:21:54,605
But what if the screen did not look like a screen?

1006
01:21:55,683 --> 01:21:56,650
What if...

1007
01:21:56,684 --> 01:22:04,557
He only person controlled by a person who is behind the scenes?

1008
01:22:04,558 --> 01:22:06,753
You are right.

1009
01:22:22,576 --> 01:22:24,806
I say let you sleep is a good thing.

1010
01:22:24,812 --> 01:22:27,713
Over the past 17 hours.

1011
01:22:27,748 --> 01:22:30,581
How do you feel?

1012
01:22:30,584 --> 01:22:32,677
Super.

1013
01:22:34,722 --> 01:22:38,715
I can not express how much I mernghargai Jack-Jack you cared for me, E.

1014
01:22:38,726 --> 01:22:41,695
Yes, I believe gratitude is very able to accept.

1015
01:22:41,729 --> 01:22:45,756
Do not ever ask me to do it again, my schedule is really solid.

1016
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:52,672
I am kidding. I'm happy with it. I love your son.

1017
01:22:52,673 --> 01:22:57,610
Most of thy evil. As babies in general, he has unlimited potential.

1018
01:22:57,611 --> 01:23:03,675
As you know, this young man has so much expertise.

1019
01:23:03,717 --> 01:23:08,518
They, dear?

1020
01:23:20,701 --> 01:23:23,829
I understand the lack of sleep you can not judge something well.

1021
01:23:23,838 --> 01:23:27,672
That could be anything. And your son is the same.

1022
01:23:27,675 --> 01:23:30,576
Really has unlimited power potential.

1023
01:23:30,611 --> 01:23:34,604
I've made something for him.

1024
01:23:39,787 --> 01:23:40,754
You put him in ...

1025
01:23:40,754 --> 01:23:45,555
In a special room. Look what happened. And all would be fine.

1026
01:23:45,593 --> 01:23:53,659
- your challenge is to make the baby can control his power. - More or less.

1027
01:23:53,667 --> 01:23:57,728
I've worked in the field of music, and I know the baby responded to it well.

1028
01:23:57,771 --> 01:24:00,672
Mainly Mozart.

1029
01:24:00,674 --> 01:24:05,771
I make a special outfit for her.

1030
01:24:05,779 --> 01:24:12,617
And with this tablet you can monitor your baby.

1031
01:24:12,653 --> 01:24:15,622
Jeez ... what did he do?

1032
01:24:15,656 --> 01:24:22,755
Well, this is Mozart. Just accept it. The important thing you can monitor and anticipate changes.

1033
01:24:22,763 --> 01:24:25,698
Oh no. I had to take the cake.

1034
01:24:25,699 --> 01:24:35,768
Needless cake. I learned overnight. If he did not get a cake he would turn out to be evil.

1035
01:24:36,677 --> 01:24:40,545
Threatening danger. What does it mean?

1036
01:24:40,581 --> 01:24:50,616
This means that fire. I suggest you put out the fire.

1037
01:24:51,692 --> 01:24:55,560
And the use of other foods to disable it.

1038
01:24:55,562 --> 01:24:59,623
Delicious and can be eaten.

1039
01:24:59,767 --> 01:25:01,564
That's helpful.

1040
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:05,800
Although I have to admit this is the greatest accomplishments overnight.

1041
01:25:05,839 --> 01:25:09,741
The tool has many functions we need to talk.

1042
01:25:09,743 --> 01:25:12,541
Thanks again, E. For everything.

1043
01:25:12,579 --> 01:25:13,705
How much do I owe you?

1044
01:25:13,714 --> 01:25:21,678
Stop basimu ado. The pay is that I will be forever on the family's clothes designer

1045
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:29,789
until the end of time. But being a baby sitter, I do it for free.

1046
01:25:46,714 --> 01:25:49,581
I already know taunting to extend your hand.

1047
01:25:49,616 --> 01:25:52,676
Temperatures around here a little bit cold.

1048
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:55,553
Try to lengthen your arms, you will be destroyed.

1049
01:25:55,556 --> 01:25:57,683
So you're Screenslaver?

1050
01:25:57,725 --> 01:26:00,592
True. And it's not.

1051
01:26:00,594 --> 01:26:04,724
Just tell me who created it. And spreading his message.

1052
01:26:04,765 --> 01:26:05,789
What Winston knows?

1053
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:09,530
That I'm the Screenslaver? Certainly not.

1054
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:13,666
Can you imagine what they would do with technology hipnotisku?

1055
01:26:13,674 --> 01:26:14,800
Worship what you do.

1056
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:19,643
Hey, I'm using the technology to destroy the confidence of people.

1057
01:26:19,646 --> 01:26:21,637
As I take advantage of a super hero.

1058
01:26:21,648 --> 01:26:23,513
Who I was put into prison?

1059
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:28,578
Only a courier. Useless. Aimless life.

1060
01:26:28,622 --> 01:26:32,558
I must say I give you a good role.

1061
01:26:32,559 --> 01:26:34,754
What does not make you disturbed an innocent man go to jail because of you?

1062
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:36,730
He's a fool.

1063
01:26:36,764 --> 01:26:38,527
And he is stiff.

1064
01:26:38,565 --> 01:26:39,793
I trust you.

1065
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,665
That is where you failed.

1066
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:44,569
- What? - Why do you believe me?

1067
01:26:44,571 --> 01:26:45,799
Because I lend you bike?

1068
01:26:45,839 --> 01:26:49,570
Since my sister made a theme song for you?

1069
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:50,736
We do not know each other.

1070
01:26:50,744 --> 01:26:52,678
But you can trust me.

1071
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:57,810
It should be, is not it? Because you have the strength, and lavish costumes.

1072
01:26:57,851 --> 01:27:02,652
And we have to rely on and trust.

1073
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:04,817
That's what my father believed.

1074
01:27:04,825 --> 01:27:07,521
When our house was robbed.

1075
01:27:07,561 --> 01:27:11,588
My mother wanted to hide. He begged my father to open the hidden room.

1076
01:27:11,632 --> 01:27:15,728
But my father insisted to call a friend of his hero.

1077
01:27:15,736 --> 01:27:18,671
He's dead. By useless.

1078
01:27:18,705 --> 01:27:20,673
Foolishly.

1079
01:27:20,707 --> 01:27:23,540
Waiting for the hero to save us.

1080
01:27:23,544 --> 01:27:24,738
But why ... your sister ...

1081
01:27:24,778 --> 01:27:26,769
He was a child.

1082
01:27:26,814 --> 01:27:30,773
He remembers the days in which we have a hero.

1083
01:27:30,784 --> 01:27:34,686
So, like a child, Winston still stupid.

1084
01:27:34,688 --> 01:27:38,624
Mom and Dad ran for the heroes escape.

1085
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:42,755
And we have to surrender to hang our fate in the hands of others.

1086
01:27:42,796 --> 01:27:45,788
Heroes make us weak.

1087
01:27:45,799 --> 01:27:48,563
What are you going to kill me?

1088
01:27:48,569 --> 01:27:50,696
No.

1089
01:27:51,605 --> 01:27:52,765
Using you still better.

1090
01:27:52,806 --> 01:27:58,767
You're going to help to make it illegal hero forever.

1091
01:28:05,552 --> 01:28:05,813
Ready?

1092
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:08,583
Mata laser.

1093
01:28:08,622 --> 01:28:10,613
Stop.

1094
01:28:11,658 --> 01:28:13,626
That's not how. Look at this.

1095
01:28:13,627 --> 01:28:16,687
Jack-Jack, are you ready?

1096
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:28,665
Do not make this baby shot in the house. Do you understand?

1097
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:31,542
It is interesting.

1098
01:28:31,545 --> 01:28:34,571
We're going to teach him how to control his power. Okay?

1099
01:28:34,581 --> 01:28:37,550
Display screen.

1100
01:28:37,751 --> 01:28:38,740
He disappeares.

1101
01:28:38,752 --> 01:28:40,617
That's really cool.

1102
01:28:40,621 --> 01:28:43,818
All right, good. Use it. Use. Press.

1103
01:28:43,824 --> 01:28:51,560
You see the radar, its shape. That office. Use it to track him down, so where is he?

1104
01:28:51,765 --> 01:28:53,665
There.

1105
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:57,636
OK. Exit. Time for cake.

1106
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:01,708
- Jack-Jack. - Keren.

1107
01:29:07,714 --> 01:29:09,682
- Hello? - Elastigirl in trouble.

1108
01:29:09,716 --> 01:29:10,808
What? What happened to him?

1109
01:29:10,851 --> 01:29:14,548
Sorry, to tell you over the phone. Meet me on the plane Devtech.

1110
01:29:14,555 --> 01:29:18,514
Devtech plane. I would arrive in 15 minutes.

1111
01:29:18,725 --> 01:29:22,525
Lucius. Bob. Helen in trouble. I need someone to look after the children.

1112
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:27,557
- Wear your costume. It would be strange. - I'll get there. 15 minutes.

1113
01:29:30,604 --> 01:29:33,539
I have to go. I'll be home soon. Lucius will arrive here.

1114
01:29:33,574 --> 01:29:35,633
Do not make him shoot in the house. Okay?

1115
01:29:35,642 --> 01:29:40,773
What happened with the plane in Devtech? And why are you wearing your super?

1116
01:29:51,725 --> 01:29:53,556
What is a super mom clothes?

1117
01:29:53,594 --> 01:29:55,562
He may need it. You never know.

1118
01:29:55,596 --> 01:29:56,756
What happened?

1119
01:29:56,763 --> 01:30:01,826
I do not know. But Father Lucius after getting the phone call about the mother and then go

1120
01:30:01,835 --> 01:30:03,803
I thought you did not like to be a superhero.

1121
01:30:03,804 --> 01:30:09,674
Yes, but I have to help my family. Wear.

1122
01:30:19,686 --> 01:30:23,645
Hello, little friend.

1123
01:30:23,690 --> 01:30:25,555
You are not safe.

1124
01:30:25,559 --> 01:30:26,583
Deborah sent us to take you.

1125
01:30:26,627 --> 01:30:33,692
Well, the father had just told me to keep them.

1126
01:30:34,668 --> 01:30:36,795
Because these children are safe.

1127
01:30:36,837 --> 01:30:39,533
I understand, it is sometimes confusing.

1128
01:30:39,539 --> 01:30:42,531
Go. You understand, right, Miss ...

1129
01:30:42,576 --> 01:30:43,634

1130
01:30:43,677 --> 01:30:46,646
Ninth Voyd.

1131
01:30:46,647 --> 01:30:48,740
Good night.

1132
01:30:57,591 --> 01:31:01,550
Happily, he asked us to take you too.

1133
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:03,722
As ...

1134
01:31:03,764 --> 01:31:06,562
That will not hold them for long.

1135
01:31:06,566 --> 01:31:08,761
Quick save yourselves.

1136
01:31:10,771 --> 01:31:12,830
Come on!

1137
01:31:17,711 --> 01:31:20,612
To my car!

1138
01:31:28,722 --> 01:31:32,658
Vi, what happened?

1139
01:31:50,777 --> 01:31:53,746
It works.

01:31:57,751 --> 01:32:01,551
lncredibile open the door.

1141
01:32:01,555 --> 01:32:03,819
Step into.

1142
01:32:08,729 --> 01:32:12,756
Turn on the navigation system.

1143
01:32:12,766 --> 01:32:16,793
- Frog fire. - Jack Rubber.

1144
01:32:19,806 --> 01:32:22,502
No.

1145
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:25,568
We must flee.

1146
01:32:32,586 --> 01:32:33,814
- What news? - Good news and bad news.

1147
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:41,750
We find him, physically well but she was not aware of.

1148
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:46,731
Strange house.

1149
01:32:53,673 --> 01:32:55,641
Helen.

1150
01:32:55,675 --> 01:32:58,610
Helen, what are you ...

1151
01:33:05,719 --> 01:33:08,779

lncredibile spinning.

1153
01:33:31,778 --> 01:33:37,808
We could not go, they all wear glasses.

1154
01:33:37,818 --> 01:33:40,719
They are under the influence of a person.

1155
01:33:40,754 --> 01:33:44,747
But how can we restore them?

1156
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:55,531
Okay, the man was eyeing us, but with our power, this car ...

1157
01:33:57,537 --> 01:33:59,596
Quiet.

1158
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:14,543
lncredibile continue the journey.

1159
01:34:16,656 --> 01:34:20,558
The boy fled but we caught Bob Parr.

1160
01:34:20,594 --> 01:34:24,530
Take him to the ship immediately.

01:34:29,569 --> 01:34:30,695

He does what I say.

1166
01:35:00,767 --> 01:35:03,793
- We did not plan this, Ralph. - What do you mean? We are here, right?

1167
01:35:03,803 --> 01:35:09,673
Yes, we are here. We should be up there.

1168
01:35:10,677 --> 01:35:15,546
Okay, the ejection seat lncredibile.

1169
01:35:15,549 --> 01:35:17,540

01:35:17,584 --> 01:35:20,747
- Do not! - We go.

1171
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:29,722
Come on.

1172

01:35:45,645 --> 01:35:50,673
- Where's our star, the show was about to begin. - He can not appear.

1174
01:35:50,717 --> 01:35:53,550
He will join another time.

1175
01:35:53,553 --> 01:35:55,714
The attention of the audience.

1176
01:35:55,722 --> 01:35:59,715
This ship is the largest ship on the planet.

1177
01:35:59,759 --> 01:36:05,561
So, hold onto something because we will be moving quickly.

1178
01:36:22,649 --> 01:36:25,812
We must look for mom and dad. Stay here, I'll look for them.

1179
01:36:25,819 --> 01:36:28,754
Wait, who will oversee the back here?

1180
01:36:28,755 --> 01:36:30,780
Face it, I will not be long.

1181
01:36:30,824 --> 01:36:33,657
Wait! Wait!

1182
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:37,756
This is important, they are in trouble, his fate is in our hands.

1183
01:36:37,797 --> 01:36:39,560
Understand?

1184
01:36:39,566 --> 01:36:43,593
Make her laugh but do not be noisy.

1185
01:37:02,589 --> 01:37:04,750
Jack-Jack.

1186
01:37:12,832 --> 01:37:16,632
Jack-Jack.

1187
01:37:48,668 --> 01:37:51,569
- Jack-Jack. - They know we are here.

1188
01:37:51,604 --> 01:37:53,799
I found my father and mother ... Where is Jack-Jack?

1189
01:37:53,807 --> 01:37:57,607
What? Your job is only one.

1190
01:37:57,610 --> 01:38:00,602
Tracker. Use the tracer.

1191
01:38:02,849 --> 01:38:05,579
- He's up? - Is he moving?

1192
01:38:05,585 --> 01:38:07,610
Let's go.

1193
01:38:08,655 --> 01:38:12,614
Hey, little baby. You are very...

1194
01:38:13,626 --> 01:38:18,654
And here's their ... our super hero.

1195
01:38:18,665 --> 01:38:20,724
I told you they would be fine.

1196
01:38:20,734 --> 01:38:22,759
Hey, what do you make new glasses?

1197
01:38:22,802 --> 01:38:26,533
Yes, fashionable, good, right?

1198
01:38:26,539 --> 01:38:29,770
Simple and all can wear ... and we are airborne in ...

1199
01:38:29,809 --> 01:38:32,573
3, 2, 1.

1200
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:39,610
This is a historical moment, we will all soon witness a very rare thing.

1201
01:38:39,619 --> 01:38:43,555
We agree with the outside world.

1202
01:38:43,757 --> 01:38:47,557
We agree to correct bad decisions

1203
01:38:47,594 --> 01:38:50,586

so that they are beneficial to the world.

1206
01:38:57,771 --> 01:39:02,606
You all represent a commitment to superheroes.

1207
01:39:02,609 --> 01:39:04,702
Ambassador Salomon.

1208
01:39:04,744 --> 01:39:06,803
Yes, the harder she can not hear you.

1209
01:39:06,813 --> 01:39:08,804
- Thank you very much. - Thanks ambassador

to support krusialmu.

1211
01:39:11,651 --> 01:39:15,610
No more than you deserve for the first signature

1212
01:39:15,655 --> 01:39:20,615
in the Charter of the International Super Hero.

1213
01:39:36,643 --> 01:39:37,769
My goodness!

1214
01:39:37,811 --> 01:39:41,747
Put out the fire.

1215
01:39:47,654 --> 01:39:50,680
He is coming.

1216
01:39:57,831 --> 01:39:59,628
Is he okay?

1217
01:39:59,666 --> 01:40:03,534
I told you to take care of today ...

1218
01:40:26,726 --> 01:40:29,524
No!

1219
01:40:29,529 --> 01:40:31,520
Give it to me cake.

1220
01:40:31,564 --> 01:40:34,624
Cake again?

1221
01:40:46,613 --> 01:40:49,776
- See you later. - Get back!

1222
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:56,748
- Damn. - Through this way.

1223
01:40:57,690 --> 01:41:02,627
Once again the world is becoming a super back.

1224
01:41:06,633 --> 01:41:09,534
Looking ahead, come on. Next to everything.

1225

March. Come on, line up.

1226

Everything smile.

1227
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:21,740
Continue Phase 2.

1228
01:41:21,781 --> 01:41:31,588
You always made it difficult, just to tidy up your carelessness.

1229
01:41:31,624 --> 01:41:37,688
Your body is weak, and you will receive a reward for it.

1230
01:41:37,697 --> 01:41:40,757
We no longer serve you. We only serve ourselves.

1231
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,668
We wish the best survived.

1232
01:41:45,605 --> 01:41:49,598
That scene is very harmonious one.

1233
01:41:49,642 --> 01:41:54,773
And before advertising, be careful.

1234
01:42:08,594 --> 01:42:10,653
- Emergency ... - Let him call.

1235
01:42:10,663 --> 01:42:12,722
Superheroes take over the bridge by force.

1236
01:42:12,732 --> 01:42:15,701
- Repeat. - Now!

1237
01:42:25,578 --> 01:42:30,515
A little more ... stop.

1238
01:42:34,687 --> 01:42:36,814
What? Baby?

1239
01:42:36,823 --> 01:42:39,792
mother and father.

1240
01:42:42,562 --> 01:42:45,690
Jack-like, no!

1241
01:42:46,532 --> 01:42:51,663
Super baby? No, no.

1242
01:42:53,573 --> 01:42:56,770
No, no! Put him down.

1243
01:42:57,610 --> 01:43:01,569
Mother. Catch this.

1244
01:43:08,588 --> 01:43:10,818
No!

1245
01:43:10,823 --> 01:43:15,692
- Hey, it's me. - Yes, that's what I thought last time.

1246
01:43:15,728 --> 01:43:20,665
You come for us?

1247
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:23,601
- Do not be angry. - Oh dear.

1248
01:43:23,603 --> 01:43:25,571
How can I do that?

1249
01:43:25,605 --> 01:43:27,664
I am proud.

1250
01:43:27,707 --> 01:43:30,801
Not intend to ruin the atmosphere, but we are no where?

1251
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:35,770
- What is the problem Devtech? - Evelyn Deavor, controlling ...

1252
01:43:35,782 --> 01:43:38,615
we.

1253
01:43:38,651 --> 01:43:43,611
- Where the wheel? - Did I do that?

1254
01:43:43,623 --> 01:43:44,749
Seragammu.GuavaBerry

1255
01:43:44,791 --> 01:43:47,726
Capture.

1256
01:43:48,694 --> 01:43:52,562
Phase 3, continue phase 3.

1257
01:43:54,567 --> 01:43:56,592
Why are children here? Do not you go home?

1258
01:43:56,636 --> 01:43:59,799
I went to the house, just ask them.

1259
01:43:59,806 --> 01:44:01,569
He's lying.

1260
01:44:01,607 --> 01:44:04,633
Okay, you should not ...

1261
01:44:06,579 --> 01:44:08,706
Caution!

1262
01:44:10,817 --> 01:44:16,551
- Jack-Jack, had the power? - We'll talk later.

1263
01:44:50,556 --> 01:44:52,649
Mata laser.

1264
01:45:18,818 --> 01:45:20,786
Come on follow me.

1265
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:22,788
- We're done? - You'll be safe here.

1266
01:45:22,788 --> 01:45:26,622
Secure? Safe from what?

1267
01:45:26,659 --> 01:45:30,652
- Diplomats, superheroes ... - They hypnotized.

1268
01:45:30,663 --> 01:45:33,655
What have you done?

1269
01:45:36,569 --> 01:45:38,594
Evelyn, he fled.

1270
01:45:38,604 --> 01:45:41,801
- Well, go after him. Complete your mission. - I can not just leave.

1271
01:45:41,807 --> 01:45:45,675
How are the kids? Jack-Jack?

1272
01:45:45,711 --> 01:45:48,805
Go, we can handle this.

1273
01:45:49,615 --> 01:45:51,549
Voyd, come with me.

1274
01:45:51,551 --> 01:45:53,781
- I'm going to turn off the engine. - I'm going to slow down the boat.

1275
01:45:53,819 --> 01:45:57,550
Wait, where the gun?

1276
01:45:57,590 --> 01:45:59,751
Sitting now!

1277
01:46:14,674 --> 01:46:17,700
- For the sake of good. - No!

1278
01:46:17,743 --> 01:46:20,610
thanks.

1279
01:46:30,656 --> 01:46:34,592
- What is your plan? - Take me to the top of the jet.

1280
01:46:56,749 --> 01:46:59,741
Hey, you do this. Can you do it again?

1281
01:46:59,752 --> 01:47:02,585
- Do you want me back? - What?

1282
01:47:02,622 --> 01:47:06,649
- Can not do that? - No, I do not Protects crushed crusher.

1283
01:47:06,659 --> 01:47:09,753
Entry into the engine room. Forget, not enough time.

1284
01:47:09,795 --> 01:47:14,698
When you were asked to return to normal, what are you doing?

1285
01:47:16,769 --> 01:47:22,765
Welcome to the airlines Elastigirl, we reached cruising altitude.

1286
01:47:22,808 --> 01:47:28,747
For the sake of your safety wear seat belts, or silent and calm.

1287
01:47:28,748 --> 01:47:32,616
It's all about you.

1288
01:47:40,593 --> 01:47:43,562
- I can not enter the engine room. - We have to do something.

1289
01:47:43,596 --> 01:47:44,756
I've tried to slow down but to no avail.

1290
01:47:44,764 --> 01:47:46,698
Hey, how about reversing the boat?

1291
01:47:46,732 --> 01:47:47,790
That's not a good idea.

1292
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:50,598
- That means, we will be outside. - Yes!

1293
01:47:50,603 --> 01:47:55,540
If we put the brakes on the reef and change kincirnya we can keep the ship from the city.

1294
01:47:55,574 --> 01:47:56,802
- It might work. - I'll divert the ship,

1295
01:47:56,842 --> 01:47:59,572
- you bend kincirnya. - Using the stairs?

1296
01:47:59,578 --> 01:48:02,638
It was under water, how? Oh, unbelievable.

1297
01:48:02,682 --> 01:48:04,741
- Come on, kids. - Dad!

1298
01:48:04,784 --> 01:48:09,551
I know this will work, but if it did not work when we crash,

1299
01:48:09,588 --> 01:48:12,716
shield will protect this ship.

1300
01:48:12,725 --> 01:48:16,684
I have to live here, along with Jack-Jack.

1301
01:48:16,696 --> 01:48:17,754
That's just my daughter.

1302
01:48:17,797 --> 01:48:22,632
Come on, steered to the right.

1303
01:48:27,673 --> 01:48:30,733
You know what's bad?

1304
01:48:32,745 --> 01:48:37,808
The work is not recognized in your life, by your good friend.

1305
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:40,648
I wish I had ...

1306
01:48:40,653 --> 01:48:43,645
that ability.

1307
01:48:44,623 --> 01:48:47,786
The latest news, still no radio contact

1308
01:48:47,827 --> 01:48:53,629
The boat had changed direction and headed for the city at high speed.

1309
01:48:56,669 --> 01:48:58,660
Hear.

1310
01:48:59,572 --> 01:49:04,669
- After I turn this boat, you press the button. - Okay, dad.

1311
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:07,645
Now drop anchor ...

1312
01:49:09,782 --> 01:49:13,616
Reputation as a super hero is destroyed.

1313
01:49:13,652 --> 01:49:17,611
You'll never be legal.

1314
01:49:17,623 --> 01:49:19,557
Never?

1315
01:49:19,558 --> 01:49:20,525
No.

1316
01:49:20,559 --> 01:49:22,527
- At all? - No.

1317
01:49:22,528 --> 01:49:25,691
Not at all?

1318
01:49:25,731 --> 01:49:31,670
Hypoxia, lack of oxygen in your brain.

1319
01:49:37,777 --> 01:49:41,770
You will feel weak and then you will die.

1320
01:49:41,814 --> 01:49:45,773
- I do not want to die. - No one wants to die.

1321
01:49:45,818 --> 01:49:47,683
Seriously?

1322
01:49:47,686 --> 01:49:50,746
Pity you.

1323
01:50:07,773 --> 01:50:13,803
Everything, we have to go to the back of the boat. Superheroes protect the ambassador.

1324
01:50:13,813 --> 01:50:16,680
Go!

1325
01:50:17,817 --> 01:50:22,618
He spent too long in the water.

1326
01:50:28,694 --> 01:50:33,654
- Pull him. - Wait, is too early.

1327
01:50:45,611 --> 01:50:49,672
- He's going to die. - Patience!

1328
01:51:02,795 --> 01:51:06,526
The ship turned. It worked.

1329
01:51:08,701 --> 01:51:12,603
- Now! - Ralph, now!

1330
01:51:13,806 --> 01:51:17,606
Let's open the parachute.

1331
01:51:18,711 --> 01:51:22,545
Open the chute.

1332
01:51:23,616 --> 01:51:27,552
Helen, use a parachute.

1333
01:51:33,626 --> 01:51:36,720
We're going to die!

1334
01:51:56,649 --> 01:51:59,641
I missed the first drama Jack-Jack?

1335
01:51:59,652 --> 01:52:03,645
Actually, you missed the first 17 years.

1336
01:52:15,668 --> 01:52:19,695
The fact you saved me does not make you right.

1337
01:52:19,738 --> 01:52:23,674
- But, that keep you alive. - And I'm grateful for that.

1338
01:52:23,709 --> 01:52:26,701
Sorry, but what I know you?

1339
01:52:26,712 --> 01:52:30,648
Sorry, he will not accept to be treated like that again.

1340
01:52:30,683 --> 01:52:33,675
First of all, Violet I like you.

1341
01:52:33,719 --> 01:52:40,682
And who knows the future? But I have a good feeling with you all.

1342
01:52:40,693 --> 01:52:41,682
A good feeling?

1343
01:52:41,727 --> 01:52:43,695
What should we worry?

1344
01:52:43,696 --> 01:52:46,529
You must.

1345
01:52:46,565 --> 01:52:48,590
I see what you did before, it was incredible.

1346
01:52:48,601 --> 01:52:52,662
And not everyone can do it.

1347
01:52:53,606 --> 01:52:57,542
My favorite car.

1348
01:53:08,721 --> 01:53:13,624
On extraordinary services they have done

1349
01:53:13,659 --> 01:53:19,598
With this super hero status restated legal.

1350
01:53:26,772 --> 01:53:31,766
- You do not know, right? - No, wait ...

1351
01:53:31,777 --> 01:53:36,544
- What do you girls who wear the mask? - I'm Violet.

1352
01:53:36,582 --> 01:53:38,743
I'm Tony.

1353
01:53:48,661 --> 01:53:50,754
- Tony, this is my mother. - Nice to meet you.

1354
01:53:50,763 --> 01:53:53,527
- It's my father. - We never met.

1355
01:53:53,565 --> 01:53:57,763
- This is embarrassing ... my brother Dash. - I'm short.

1356
01:53:57,803 --> 01:54:03,799
And baby Jack-Jack. I tried to reduce so one parent.

1357
01:54:03,809 --> 01:54:06,676
We're all going to watch a movie, honey.

1358
01:54:06,679 --> 01:54:11,673
Too early, we decided on the theater. Not like that?

1359
01:54:11,717 --> 01:54:18,680
He jokes, they just drove us to the theater. They have other business.

1360
01:54:18,691 --> 01:54:21,660
So, I think you guys close.

1361
01:54:21,694 --> 01:54:25,653
- I guess. - We can get closer.

1362
01:54:39,645 --> 01:54:40,771
Let us out.

1363
01:54:40,779 --> 01:54:44,772
Sorry, Tony. Buy popcorn, find a chair for me.

1364
01:54:44,817 --> 01:54:49,777
I was back before the preview ends.
