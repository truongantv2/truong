1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Over 100 years ago, Titans suddenly appeared

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and devoured most of humanity,
decimating civilization.

3
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,800
The survivors built three
massive concentric walls

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to prevent another Titan invasion,
and managed a peaceful life inside.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But even though the walls
have stood for 100 years,

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
there are no guarantees
they won't fall today.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He was fired again!
What a hopeless kid.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Eren? again?

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What to do with him...

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What to do, indeed.

11
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,600
Sorry Dad, I need to step out.

12
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,700
Going to see Eren?

13
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,700
Tell him...

14
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,500
I'm all out of job leads.

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm going now.

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,190
Make it clear.

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
The usual hill, I bet.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,000
Be careful.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
- Hey there.
- Can I get some rapeseed oil?

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,300
It's a good crop this year.

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,300
- A full tank.
- Sure thing.

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Outta the way!

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Armin! This thing you made me,
it broke.

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,900
See?

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll fix it later.

26
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,300
Don't take too long.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Oh, sorry.

28
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
- Is Mikasa around?
- Mikasa?

29
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Mikasa!

30
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Eren!

31
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,300
I knew you would be here.

32
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
This thing keeps people away.

33
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
It's dangerous.

34
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,300
Chill out.
It's a dud bomb.

35
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Eren!

36
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,000
Ow..

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500
What if it explodes?

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
So be it.

39
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,500
I wouldn't mind...

40
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,300
If it blew us all up.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
Heard you got fired again.

42
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,420
Only a month into the job.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Longer than the security gig.

44
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,400
Why can't you ever stick with something?

45
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
What is it you want to do?

46
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,000
Are you happy just taking
over for your dad?

47
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,000
Look.. This runs on batteries.

48
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,100
Batteries?

49
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,600
I want to make more things like these.

50
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,400
Just be careful so
you don't get arrested.

51
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,300
And you, Mikasa?

52
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,300
- Me?
- Yeah

53
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,690
I only...

54
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Are you content?

55
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,500
The Inner District is full
of big buildings and rich people.

56
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
Lots of stuff you can't find out here.

57
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,600
Don't you want to go?

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,900
Then, what about outside the Wall?

59
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Born inside the Wall

60
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,420
and dying inside it...

61
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,900
You're fine with that?

62
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,900
I'm...

63
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,620
Not!

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm just like...

65
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
this thing.

66
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Wait...

67
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Hey! Let me see.

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Look...

69
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,500


70
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,700
A woman...

71
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,400
The ocean...

72
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,020
Ocean?

73
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
The big water you mentioned?

74
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
This blue thing must be the ocean.

75
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,200
Ocean?

76
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
So, it was real.

77
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
- Not a pond?
- A billion times bigger.

78
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
That really exists out there?

79
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
Just like I said.

80
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,700
I wonder if that bird has seen the ocean.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Wanna see it?

82
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,000
Protecting the Wall instead of people.

83
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Screw that job.

84
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
Let's go.

85
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
Wait a second...

86
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,500
We can't get near it.

87
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
This way.

88
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,100
Hurry, over here.

89
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
It'll be fine.

90
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Careful.

91
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Right?

92
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,900
I've never seen the Wall this close.

93
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,900
Let's go.

94
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't need to go now.

95
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,600
Then when?

96
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
If you climb the Wall,
you'll be executed.

97
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
And they say the outside
is full of Titans.

98
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,100
Due to a huge bomb only
Titans can survive outside.

99
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You seriously believe in Titans?

100
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,900
No one's seen them in over 100 years.

101
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Yet we're holed up in here, afraid of them.

102
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
I'm sick of it.

103
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Maybe the other side...

104
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
is Paradise.

105
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,650
Hey, what're you doing?

106
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,200
You renegades!

107
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,700
Come!

108
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
This is off-limits!

109
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,050
Don't touch her!

110
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,100
Stop resisting!

111
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
That was uncalled for!

112
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Armin, don't!

113
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
That's enough.

114
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Hey, hey...

115
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,350
You haven't changed.

116
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Old man Souda..

117
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Leave this to me.

118
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Hey! They're just kids.

119
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,300
Go.

120
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
Go on.

121
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,800
So, you're trying to
showoff in front of her?

122
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
It's not like that.

123
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,900
I get it.
I get it.

124
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,400
I was caught doing the
same thing as a kid.

125
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
I asked your mom to come along.

126
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,100
Your dad ended up winning her, though.

127
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,100
This isn't about that.

128
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,900
It just pisses me off.

129
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
"Even Paradise could become a prison...

130
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,000
if you take notice of the walls".

131
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Now, don't tell the others about this.

132
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
We're starting a scout.

133
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,700
A scout?

134
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,500
You're going outside?

135
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,700
Lies. It'll fall through again.

136
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,900
It won't!

137
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,600
Looks like the Council
will finally pass it.

138
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,000
The public discontent is rising.

139
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,500
You're really...
going outside the Wall?

140
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,600
We're forming a Scout Regiment.

141
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,000
Eren.. how about it?

142
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,300
Once we find new land

143
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,800
we're free to live anywhere.

144
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,800
Mikasa...

145
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
An earthquake?

146
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,300
Too big for an earthquake.

147
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
The Wall's shaking!

148
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,500
It's from outside.

149
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,200
Eren, no!

150
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,400
So they're... real.

151
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
It's taller than the Wall!

152
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,000
This can't be..

153
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,200
I thought we were safe!

154
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,400
There's something there!

155
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,400
What is that?

156
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,100
Remember our drills!

157
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,300
Run! The Wall will be breached!

158
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
The town!

159
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,700
Hey! Run this way!

160
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,000
Prepare the cannons!
Prepare the cannons!

161
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,600
Hurry!

162
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,620
We don't have permission
to use gunpowder yet!

163
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,300
Hurry! They're coming!

164
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Hurry!

165
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,800
Don't panic! Remember the drills!

166
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,200
Look at those faces...

167
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,300
Prepare the cannons!

168
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,500
- Draw them in!
- Yes, sir!

169
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,800
Prepare the cannons!

170
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,500
Ready to fire!

171
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,000
Fire!

172
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,300
It's a hit!

173
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,250
The legend was true...

174
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,300
They're immortal.

175
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,300
Reload!

176
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,900
Come on!

177
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
It's hopeless.

178
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,850
Help me! I'm sorry...

179
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,450
I'm sorry!

180
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,450
Squad Leader!

181
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,470
Squad Leader!

182
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,500
Let's run!

183
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,100
Armin!

184
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,500
Ready!

185
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,800
That thing won't...

186
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
I'm gonna check on my home!

187
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Armin, run...

188
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,720
That's.. Armin's dad.

189
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,450
Let's go in!

190
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Please don't push!

191
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Wait!

192
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Wait!

193
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,650
That woman...

194
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
I'll go!

195
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,700
Get up!

196
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,550
I'll get the baby.

197
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,700
Mikasa!

198
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,200
Mikasa!

199
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,900
That's it, close it! Now!

200
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
Close the door!

201
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,900
Why?

202
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,200
There's still room!

203
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,300
Don't you dare open it!

204
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
The Titans are coming!

205
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,700
Only trying to save yourselves...

206
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,450
Mikasa!

207
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,650
Hold him down!

208
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,650
Mikasa!

209
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,850
Mikasa...

210
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:08,650
Help!

211
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,250
Two Years Later.

212
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,250
The price for our years of peace

213
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,250
was paid for with tragedy.

214
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,750
The Outer Wall...

215
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,750
at Monzen District

216
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,650
was destroyed by a Titan
larger than ever imagined.

217
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,650
Unable to counter the surge of Titans,

218
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,650
we abandoned the agricultural zone

219
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,650
and retreated behind the Middle
Wall to the commercial zone.

220
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,050
With hordes of refugees

221
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:54,700
and the loss of farmlands
our food shortage is becoming dire.

222
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,700
In order to reclaim our farmlands,

223
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,700
we must restore the broken Outer Wall.

224
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,700
It is to carry out this prestigious mission

225
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,700
that you have all completed your training.

226
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,770
- Weapons Squad Leader Hans.
- Sir!

227
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,000
The days of our being
trampled by Titans are over.

228
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,100
Now we have Omni-Directional Mobility Gear!

229
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:45,000
With ODMG... victory will be ours!

230
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
At the Omotemachi transit point,

231
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,700
we will join the recon
team led by Captain Shikishima.

232
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,500
Captain Shikishima!

233
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
We will depart for Monzen at sunset.

234
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,700
May you fight to honor
the spirits of the war dead.

235
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,900
Give your hearts!

236
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,600
Give your hearts!

237
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,200
I'll be back, so take care of Mom.

238
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,900
The family's in your hands.

239
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Now that's a good daughter.

240
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,900
You were always a glutton,
never making yourself useful.

241
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Sasha, pick'em up!
Pick'em up I said.

242
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,620
- I'm sorry.
- Just do it, Sasha.

243
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,500
Jean, my son, you must take revenge for me.

244
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,620
Jean, become the pride of our clan.

245
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,100
Offer your soul to the spirits of the war dead.
Jean! Jean!

246
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,900
Mommy's only going to be
gone for a little bit, okay!

247
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,700
Just be a good girl and... Riko!

248
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Riko!

249
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,700
Hey, don't cry, little brother..
Hey, hey...

250
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,700
Koyuki, who's this?
Is this supposed to be me?

251
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:17,700
- It's a little fat to be me, no?
- Hey, don't cry, I'll be fine...

252
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Cry baby.

253
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,800
No one's gonna be waiting for us.

254
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Mister.

255
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,400
Here, you can have this.

256
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Thanks.

257
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Koyuki, your brother's leaving now.

258
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,700
Brother...

259
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Koyuki, let's go.

260
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
That's mine!

261
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Mr. Souda.

262
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Armin...

263
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,220
Old man Souda?

264
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,100
Eren?

265
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
So you're alive!

266
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,100
So now...

267
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,450
you boys, too.

268
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,000
Well, everyone died.

269
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
What happened to the girl?

270
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,600
It was my fault.

271
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
That's not true.

272
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,200
That's why...
I'm going to get them back.

273
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,100
Revenge on the Titans, eh?

274
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:38,100
Killing one or two won't
make a difference, you know.

275
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,700
Why did you volunteer, then?

276
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,700
To see my wife and child.

277
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
They're waiting for me.

278
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,800
Excuse me!

279
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,300
What do you want?

280
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,300
I'm sorry.

281
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
Are you finished?

282
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,900
Are you even listening?

283
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,700
Look, right now the Outer Wall in Monzen

284
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,700
has a hole in it like this.

285
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,900
So we detonate this
portion to plug that hole.

286
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
The Wall becomes shorter, but
it's twice as tall as the Titans.

287
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,600
So we can stop any more
Titans from entering.

288
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
That's the Outer Wall Restoration Mission.

289
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,400
Once we plug that hole we
exterminate the Titans inside

290
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Sasha...

291
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,100
But previous restoration
missions failed miserably.

292
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,800
They were attacked by Titans
before reaching the Wall,

293
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
and now we are out of explosives.

294
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:30,000
All that's left are the
last explosives in Omotemachi.

295
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,700
If we fail, that'll be the end of humanity.

296
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,000
We have no choice.

297
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,300
You don't have to.

298
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,200
Pipsqueaks like you just get in the way.

299
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,300
Not just you, look around.

300
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,300
Just a bunch of useless bums.

301
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,700
It's been a long war of attrition.

302
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,400
Inevitably there will be
more inexperienced folks.

303
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Sure.

304
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,100
But even the Scout Regiment
was wiped out in this mission.

305
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,400
Instead we've got...

306
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
a potato girl whose mind
is only on eating...

307
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,600
Seconds, please.

308
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,900
How could you eat right now?

309
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Sorry, lady.

310
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Not enough farmlands.

311
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,200
But I was told workers
won't ever go hungry.

312
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
How naive are you?

313
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,000
Your parents sold you to save costs.

314
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,300
You all came here because
you couldn't find work.

315
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Now I'm being lumped with
you scum who're just here to die.

316
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,100
Stop with this talk of dying.

317
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,400
I can't... I just can't do this!

318
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,800
Lil, Lil, Lil...

319
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,200
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

320
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,900
Damn lovebirds.
Go somewhere else.

321
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,500
He seems annoyed.

322
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,900
He's afraid of Titans.

323
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,900
You nailed it.

324
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,900
Titans are like nothing to me.

325
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,500
Do Titans have nipples?

326
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
Do they have nipples?

327
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,800
You talk big for never having seen one.

328
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,200
Just a spoiled brat from inland.

329
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,400
Say that again.

330
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
They don't!

331
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,600
I told you Titans have
no reproductive organs.

332
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,100
So they have no nipples, either.

333
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,700
How they propagate is a mystery.

334
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,800
I want to dissect one, but
they evaporate when they die.

335
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,400
So I need an alive Titan!

336
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,700
I want to do this!

337
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,600
Gather in 10 minutes for gear check!

338
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,900
Yes!

339
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Oh, that reminds me...

340
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,700
There was a guy who abandoned
his girl when he saw a Titan.

341
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,200
Bet he's missing his nuts, too.

342
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,400
Hey, stop it! Knock it off!

343
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,600
You two, always going at it.

344
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,900
Sannagi, let me down!

345
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,900
Let go of me!

346
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
We gather in 10 minutes.

347
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Hey, pick up the pace!

348
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It'll be okay.

349
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
You're going home.

350
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
You're from Monzen, right?

351
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Everyone died.

352
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,100
I want to go home, too.

353
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,100
Sannagi, were you from a Yuen farm?

354
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Yeah. I want to go home and farm again.

355
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,500
For my brothers and sisters

356
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,900
I'd do anything for them.

357
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,700
The old road to Omotemachi.

358
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,900
Titans sleep at night and
their eyes won't work anyway.

359
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,800
So we'll go straight to Omotemachi by dawn.

360
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,900
But do not raise your voices!

361
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,700
Titans are very responsive
to human voices.

362
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
and the other Titans will notice!

363
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,320
Bite your tongue before you scream!

364
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,450
If you don't want to die to
get to Omotemachi by dawn.

365
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,700
Open the gate!

366
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,800
"Abandon all hope, you who enter here."

367
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,300
Past this hell, the Goddess
awaits at Omotemachi.

368
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
The Goddess?

369
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,020
You don't know? The Titan-slaying
female squad leader under Shikishima.

370
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,300
They say she killed over
10 Titans in half a year.

371
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,100
Sounds more like a Grim Reaper
than a goddess.

372
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,700
- I'm afraid.
- Don't worry.

373
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,400
There's something there.

374
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,800
Stop the vehicles.

375
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,700
- Already there?
- Awfully early.

376
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,100
What's going on?
This isn't Omotemachi.

377
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,200
Check the premises.

378
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Move out.

379
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,400
Oh.. come on.

380
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
What is it?

381
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,100
Just cattle.

382
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,500
Do Titans only eat humans?

383
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,300
Forward.
Each squad to the front.

384
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,500
Potato Girl, you'll wake
up the Titans with that noise.

385
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,800
Here.

386
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,900
Not enough?

387
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,200
You always feed me.

388
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,100
Wait.

389
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,800
Still no Titans coming out.
We should get there by dawn.

390
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Hey, don't say it aloud. You'll jinx us.

391
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,400
All clear. Let's go.

392
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
There's a child...

393
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,900
A child left behind.

394
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,900
Don't be stupid.

395
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,300
We have to help.

396
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
Hey.

397
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
We have to help...

398
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Hiana...

399
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,900
I can hear it.

400
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,900
Shit.

401
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,300
We're close.

402
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
Get up!

403
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,500
Those idiots...

404
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,000
Where? Where are they?

405
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,600
Hey, keep it down.

406
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,800
You'll wake up the Titans.

407
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,600
Keep calm.

408
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,700
Keep calm!

409
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
No matter what happens...

410
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,000
don't raise your voices.

411
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Captain!

412
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,300
They brought them.

413
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,200
Director-General!

414
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,200
Go! Go!

415
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,800
Forward!

416
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,100
Hey, wait, we're not on yet!

417
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,100
You guys, wait!

418
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Just run and make it to
the tall buildings up ahead!

419
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,400
We're not fighting them?

420
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,400
- What about the ODMG?
- Where do we fire them?

421
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,800
We can't beat them head on!

422
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,300
Armin!

423
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,460
Sanagi!

424
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,300
Don't raise... your voices...

425
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,900
We're almost there! Run!

426
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,700
We're there!

427
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,600
That's Omotemachi!

428
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,900
Titans are not invincible.

429
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,900
Even if you destroy their limbs or head..
They'll quickly regenerate.

430
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
But this spot right here!

431
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:17,980
If the nape is severely damaged..
It will perish without regenerating.

432
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,500
However, it's difficult
to attack this area with firearms.

433
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:28,400
Currently, our most
effective tool is the ODMG.

434
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,200
With this on our hips we can
move quickly and freely in the air.

435
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,400
Fire the anchor and reel
it in to lift yourself up.

436
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,600
Maintain the height as
you aim for the nape.

437
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,200
Of course, remember to
evade the Titan's attacks.

438
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,300
Then use the blades to
carve the flesh from the nape.

439
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,200
Without it's nape, the Titan will die.

440
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:57,700
Once a Titan dies its body will evaporate.

441
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,200
At present this is the only
known method of klling a Titan.

442
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,100
The Scout Regiment!
That's Captain Shikishima

443
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,950
I wouldn't mind a hot
Ttitan chick for once.

444
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
We're finished!

445
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,200
I'm tying it.
Hang in there.

446
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,400
Director-General Kubal is here.

447
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
You guarded the explosives well.

448
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,800
I attempted to inspect the contents.

449
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,500
But this was impossible to open.

450
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,500
Director-General, what
about the explosives?

451
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,900
There are rumors of an insurgency,
you see.

452
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,300
I see.

453
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,200
Certainly safe down there.

454
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,600
Sorry, it was top secret.

455
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,800
Finish loading by dawn!

456
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,600
They're our last explosives.
Treat them with care.

457
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,850
You messed this whole thing up!

458
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,800
If you wanna die, do it alone!

459
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,100
You've got a death wish.

460
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,150
You smell, you spoiled brat.

461
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,400
You peed in your pants, huh?

462
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,400
The Titans scared you?

463
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Stop it!

464
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,600
Stop it!

465
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,100
You're too slow.

466
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,400
You're the one who's slow.

467
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Thanks.

468
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,900
What the hell...

469
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,400
Enough with the disturbance.

470
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,300
Mikasa!

471
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,900
Mikasa, it's you, right?
What happened?

472
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,150
Nice kick...

473
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,800
It's Captain Shikishima!

474
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:15,850
... for just messing around.

475
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,100
Rookie, your name?

476
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,100
Eren... I'm Eren!

477
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,400
Eren?

478
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,400
From Monzen?

479
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,370
Your parents?

480
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,750
They died.
I was too young to remember

481
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,100
I see.

482
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,100
Um, about Mikasa...

483
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,500
Why is she...?

484
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,700
Why?

485
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:57,950
Why what?

486
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,160
Why is she able to toy with Titans?

487
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,200
I taught her.

488
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,250
You want to learn too, huh?

489
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,800
Well, of course... I want
to defeat the Titans.

490
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,390
Why?

491
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,600
Because I hate them... those Titans.

492
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,400
Why do you hate them?

493
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:30,040
Because... they're the
ones who trapped us in.

494
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,170
Wrong.

495
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,080
The true enemy...

496
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,040
isn't the Titans.

497
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,700
The true enemy?

498
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,380
The true enemy...

499
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,680
is safety.

500
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:03,200
What do you call animals that live
inside fences in fear of wolves?

501
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,700
Cattle.

502
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,580
And what are you?

503
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:13,650
I'm...

504
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,440
not!

505
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,880
Then go fly.

506
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,900
Fly?

507
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:29,890
You can only gain by letting go.

508
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:54,040
The kid I gave this to... he died.

509
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,840
I hear there used to be lots of machines.

510
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,800
People back then even flew the skies.

511
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,400
But now it's forbidden.

512
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,600
Director-General!

513
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,650
At ease.

514
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,600
Tell me, did you learn in school...

515
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:39,590
what that technological advancement led to?

516
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:45,580
Enviromental destruction, wasted resources,
useless competition and war.

517
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,600
Precisely.

518
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,880
Now get yourself some good rest.

519
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,090
At daybreak we head for Monzen.

520
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,380
Inspect your gear and rest up

521
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:13,300
Fighting is the one thing
he was always good at.

522
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,800
You reek of booze.

523
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,600
Why do you hate that guy so much?

524
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:27,200
His face.. as if he's carrying
the world's misery by himself.

525
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,800
He lost his girlfriend, right?

526
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,800
Her name was Mikasa.

527
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,800
Mikasa.

528
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,570
I'm just...

529
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,280
glad.

530
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,900
Glad?

531
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,880
That baby was eaten.

532
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,480
And so was I.

533
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,290
The world is cruel

534
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,700
I'm just going to kill Titans.

535
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,900
Sorry.

536
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:24,950
Did I interrupt?

537
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:30,130
No.

538
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,980
Want it?

539
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
It's good.

540
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,250
Calling the Titans again?

541
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:13,850
Sorry.

542
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:19,450
It should be me apologizing.

543
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:24,980
Forget it.

544
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,500
What happened between
you and Squad Leader Mikasa?

545
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,900
Still act like a kid, huh?

546
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:45,950
It doesn't matter... anymore.

547
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,700
- There's someone here.
- It's fine, they're not looking.

548
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,800
Hey, wait.

549
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,880
Your back feel okay?

550
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:58,770
Lil, I love you.

551
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I wonder if those two will get to marry.

552
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,460
If they make it home alive.

553
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
It's not right that we
need permission to get married.

554
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:23,030
And even if you have a baby...

555
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:31,030
Riko...

556
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,300
You have a daughter, was it?

557
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,400
By volunteering for duty,
I get child support.

558
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,840
You okay with a single mother?

559
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,100
Will you be father to my daughter?

560
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,900
I don't want to die!
No, let me go!

561
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,500
Riko...

562
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,200
We're surrounded!
We're under attack!

563
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:24,050
We're under attack!
We're under attack!

564
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,080
Lil, Lil! Hurry!

565
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,080
Put on your ODMG!

566
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,400
- Lil, let's go!
- Wait!

567
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:44,470
Defend the explosives!

568
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:51,450
Too narrow here to fire our anchors!

569
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,850
ODMG troops to the rooftop!

570
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,250
Damn!

571
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,680
Four ahead, you go left.

572
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Will do.

573
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,080
Quit fidgeting.
At least die with dignity.

574
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,300
Come on, move it!

575
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,100
It's all about the explosives!

576
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:53,450
Defend them at all costs!

577
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:59,050
This side is gone, retreat!

578
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:13,200
Hey, wake up! I said wake up!

579
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:17,180
Please, wake up...

580
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,400
It's dangerous here, let's go.

581
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:26,100
Wait! Will you please treat him?

582
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,400
I'm sorry, but your boyfriend is...

583
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,130
Fukushi...

584
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,770
We have to go.

585
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,900
Let me go! Let me go!

586
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,700
I'll kll them Titans!
I'll kill them!

587
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:57,950
Let's go.

588
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,900
Hey.

589
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Who's driving that?

590
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:07,150
No one gave you permssion!

591
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,600
Thief! He's stealing the explosives!

592
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,800
Stop! Stop!

593
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:34,000
Get out!

594
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,660
Die, you Titans!

595
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:11,090
Stop it! Stop the vehicle!

596
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:12,150
Why's it on fire?

597
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,200
Stop it!

598
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
There you are!

599
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:19,730
I'll kill you all!

600
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:27,390
Get down! Get down!

601
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,400
Fukushi..

602
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,800
How pretty.

603
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:45,490
But such a waste.

604
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,280
The explosives... That was it!

605
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,400
Don't! You're gonna die!

606
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,500
How could this happen?

607
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,300
This belonged to the thief.

608
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,260
This is hell...

609
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:50,670
What are you doing here?

610
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,640
Humans are...

611
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:03,390
weak, you see.

612
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,390
We'll be eaten.

613
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:15,660
Now's the chance... Let's run.

614
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:23,150
What do you call animals that live
inside fences in fear of wolves?

615
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:24,870
Cattle.

616
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,300
And what are you?

617
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:27,490
I'm not!

618
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,500
Then go fly.

619
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,840
Then go fly

620
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,740
I can't!
There's no way we're going to win!

621
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:45,690
Then be that way for the rest of your life!

622
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Eren!

623
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:05,650
Bastard...

624
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:13,500
Damnit.

625
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,540
You can't fear being caught!

626
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,740
Fly right into them!

627
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,800
Fly!

628
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,600
Close one.

629
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:38,400
Always go back to deliver the final blow.

630
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:41,450
I'll do it!

631
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:45,190
You're mine!

632
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,740
Well, sometimes we're unlucky.

633
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:26,740
Hey!

634
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,760
Hey, look!

635
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,660
Jean!

636
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:37,190
He only talked big.

637
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:39,250
Everyone, I have a plan.

638
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:03,050
Pull back...

639
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,740
Hey, big guy! Wanna eat more?

640
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,160
Then try eating me!

641
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,240
You can never eat enough!

642
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,940
What, you clunkhead?
You angry, huh?

643
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,940
Mr. Souda, please...

644
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,940
Guys...

645
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,260
Come here, Titans!

646
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:26,270
Come on, you slowpokes!
Come over here!

647
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,400
Now!

648
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,460
Don't mess with me!

649
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,490
Well done!

650
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,490
Good, let's move on!

651
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:18,490
Where's Eren?

652
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,560
Somewhere up there, dead.

653
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,100
Armin!

654
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:12,790
Armin...

655
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,100
Damn, they're not working!

656
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,860
Armin!

657
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:34,260
Armin!

658
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,400
I won't let you...

659
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,800
die here!

660
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,300
Eren!

661
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:55,860
Armin!

662
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Hiana!

663
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,600
I'm driving you all out...

664
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:16,650
Let's get out of here!
It's full of Titans!

665
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,880
Something's calling them.

666
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:20,040
Where's Captain Shikishima?

667
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,200
Fighting, probably.

668
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,250
Where's Director-General
and the Guards?

669
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,500
They already evacuated...

670
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:28,980
Don't tell me...
they used us as bait.

671
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,700
Minami!

672
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,040
Hey, get away, Minami!

673
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,400
Mikasa.

674
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,700
Eren was... eaten.

675
01:22:59,650 --> 01:23:01,650
It was my fault.

676
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:09,460
I'm sorry

677
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:24,550
I'll carve an escape path.

678
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:27,860
Our task is still to kill Titans.

679
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:32,770
You can't! You're almost out of gas!

680
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:31,350
Come!

681
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:40,850
What was that noise

682
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,580
What's going on?

683
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,200
A Titan attacking a Titan?

684
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:01,890
What's happening?

685
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:04,590
Look at the regeneration speed!

686
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:19,940
They're gathering here.

687
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,920
Is he on our side?

688
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:19,690
His fighting clearly
demonstrates intelligence.

689
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:43,290
I've never seen this!

690
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,200
It's him.

691
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:35,990
Mikasa, get back here!

692
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:45,270
Like hell he's on our side!

693
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:48,390
Eren?

694
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:52,540
Is it my fault?

695
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:32,040
Mikasa!

696
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:34,090
- You okay?
- Can you stand?

697
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:47,340
Is he dead?

698
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,360
So he's finally out of steam.

699
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:52,380
He'll evaporate!
He's gonna evaporate!

700
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:54,790
Ow, it's steaming hot!

701
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,960
Cut open his nape, but
don't injure the inside.

702
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,700
What? What are you talking about?

703
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:02,600
Just do it! Hurry or he'll
be absorbed into the Titan!

704
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:05,270
The cells will assimilate!

705
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:40,800
Is that Eren?

706
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,840
Eren...

707
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:49,730
So that's why the Titans'
weak spot is the nape.

708
01:30:57,430 --> 01:31:03,530
"Be careful when you fight the monsters,
unless you become one".
