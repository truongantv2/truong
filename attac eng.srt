1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Over 100 years ago, Titans suddenly appeared

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and devoured most of humanity,
decimating civilization.

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,800
The survivors built three
massive concentric walls

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to prevent another Titan invasion,
and managed a peaceful life inside.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But even though the walls
have stood for 100 years,

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
there are no guarantees
they won't fall today.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
He was fired again!
What a hopeless kid.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Eren? again?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What to do with him...

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What to do, indeed.

11
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,600
Sorry Dad, I need to step out.

12
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,700
Going to see Eren?

13
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,700
Tell him...

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,500
I'm all out of job leads.

15
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm going now.

16
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,190
Make it clear.

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
The usual hill, I bet.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,000
Be careful.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
- Hey there.
- Can I get some rapeseed oil?

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,300
It's a good crop this year.

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,300
- A full tank.
- Sure thing.

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Outta the way!

23
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Armin! This thing you made me,
it broke.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,900
See?

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll fix it later.

26
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,300
Don't take too long.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800
Oh, sorry.

28
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
- Is Mikasa around?
- Mikasa?

29
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Mikasa!

30
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Eren!

31
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,300
I knew you would be here.

32
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
This thing keeps people away.

33
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
It's dangerous.

34
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,300
Chill out.
It's a dud bomb.

35
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Eren!

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,000
Ow..

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,500
What if it explodes?

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,500
So be it.

39
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,500
I wouldn't mind...

40
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,300
If it blew us all up.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,400
Heard you got fired again.

42
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,420
Only a month into the job.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Longer than the security gig.

44
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,400
Why can't you ever stick with something?

45
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
What is it you want to do?

46
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,000
Are you happy just taking
over for your dad?

47
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,000
Look.. This runs on batteries.

48
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
Batteries?

49
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,600
I want to make more things like these.

50
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,400
Just be careful so
you don't get arrested.

51
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,300
And you, Mikasa?

52
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
- Me?
- Yeah

53
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,690
I only...

54
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Are you content?

55
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,500
The Inner District is full
of big buildings and rich people.

56
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,120
Lots of stuff you can't find out here.

57
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,600
Don't you want to go?

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,900
Then, what about outside the Wall?

59
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Born inside the Wall

60
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,420
and dying inside it...

61
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,900
You're fine with that?

62
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,900
I'm...

63
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Not!

64
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm just like...

65
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
this thing.

66
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Wait...

67
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Hey! Let me see.

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,200
Look...

69
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,500


70
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,700
A woman...

71
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,400
The ocean...

72
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,020
Ocean?

73
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
The big water you mentioned?

74
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
This blue thing must be the ocean.

75
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,200
Ocean?

76
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
So, it was real.

77
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
- Not a pond?
- A billion times bigger.

78
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
That really exists out there?

79
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
Just like I said.

80
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,700
I wonder if that bird has seen the ocean.

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Wanna see it?

82
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,000
Protecting the Wall instead of people.

83
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Screw that job.

84
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Let's go.

85
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Wait a second...

86
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,500
We can't get near it.

87
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
This way.

88
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,100
Hurry, over here.

89
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
It'll be fine.

90
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Careful.

91
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Right?

92
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,900
I've never seen the Wall this close.

93
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,900
Let's go.

94
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't need to go now.

95
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,600
Then when?

96
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
If you climb the Wall,
you'll be executed.

97
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
And they say the outside
is full of Titans.

98
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,100
Due to a huge bomb only
Titans can survive outside.

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You seriously believe in Titans?

100
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,900
No one's seen them in over 100 years.

101
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Yet we're holed up in here, afraid of them.

102
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
I'm sick of it.

103
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Maybe the other side...

104
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
is Paradise.

105
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,650
Hey, what're you doing?

106
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,200
You renegades!

107
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,700
Come!

108
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
This is off-limits!

109
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,050
Don't touch her!

110
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,100
Stop resisting!

111
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,100
That was uncalled for!

112
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Armin, don't!

113
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,700
That's enough.

114
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Hey, hey...

115
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,350
You haven't changed.

116
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Old man Souda..

117
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Leave this to me.

118
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Hey! They're just kids.

119
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,300
Go.

120
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Go on.

121
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,800
So, you're trying to
showoff in front of her?

122
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
It's not like that.

123
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
I get it.
I get it.

124
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I was caught doing the
same thing as a kid.

125
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I asked your mom to come along.

126
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:59,100
Your dad ended up winning her, though.

127
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
This isn't about that.

128
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,900
It just pisses me off.

129
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
"Even Paradise could become a prison...

130
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,000
if you take notice of the walls".

131
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Now, don't tell the others about this.

132
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
We're starting a scout.

133
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,700
A scout?

134
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,500
You're going outside?

135
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,700
Lies. It'll fall through again.

136
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,900
It won't!

137
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,600
Looks like the Council
will finally pass it.

138
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,000
The public discontent is rising.

139
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,500
You're really...
going outside the Wall?

140
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,600
We're forming a Scout Regiment.

141
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,000
Eren.. how about it?

142
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,300
Once we find new land

143
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,800
we're free to live anywhere.

144
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
Mikasa...

145
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
An earthquake?

146
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,300
Too big for an earthquake.

147
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
The Wall's shaking!

148
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,500
It's from outside.

149
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,200
Eren, no!

150
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,400
So they're... real.

151
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
It's taller than the Wall!

152
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,000
This can't be..

153
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,200
I thought we were safe!

154
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,400
There's something there!

155
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,400
What is that?

156
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,100
Remember our drills!

157
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,300
Run! The Wall will be breached!

158
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
The town!

159
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,700
Hey! Run this way!

160
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,000
Prepare the cannons!
Prepare the cannons!

161
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,600
Hurry!

162
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,620
We don't have permission
to use gunpowder yet!

163
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,300
Hurry! They're coming!

164
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Hurry!

165
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,800
Don't panic! Remember the drills!

166
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,200
Look at those faces...

167
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,300
Prepare the cannons!

168
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,500
- Draw them in!
- Yes, sir!

169
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,800
Prepare the cannons!

170
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,500
Ready to fire!

171
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,000
Fire!

172
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,300
It's a hit!

173
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,250
The legend was true...

174
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
They're immortal.

175
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,300
Reload!

176
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,900
Come on!

177
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
It's hopeless.

178
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,850
Help me! I'm sorry...

179
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,450
I'm sorry!

180
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,450
Squad Leader!

181
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,470
Squad Leader!

182
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,500
Let's run!

183
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,100
Armin!

184
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,500
Ready!

185
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,800
That thing won't...

186
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,700
I'm gonna check on my home!

187
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Armin, run...

188
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,720
That's.. Armin's dad.

189
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,450
Let's go in!

190
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Please don't push!

191
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Wait!

192
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Wait!

193
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,650
That woman...

194
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,700
I'll go!

195
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
Get up!

196
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,550
I'll get the baby.

197
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,700
Mikasa!

198
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,200
Mikasa!

199
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
That's it, close it! Now!

200
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Close the door!

201
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Why?

202
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,200
There's still room!

203
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,300
Don't you dare open it!

204
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
The Titans are coming!

205
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,700
Only trying to save yourselves...

206
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,450
Mikasa!

207
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,650
Hold him down!

208
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,650
Mikasa!

209
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,850
Mikasa...

210
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:03,650
Help!

211
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,250
Two Years Later.

212
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,250
The price for our years of peace

213
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,250
was paid for with tragedy.

214
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,750
The Outer Wall...

215
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,750
at Monzen District

216
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,650
was destroyed by a Titan
larger than ever imagined.

217
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,650
Unable to counter the surge of Titans,

218
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,650
we abandoned the agricultural zone

219
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:36,650
and retreated behind the Middle
Wall to the commercial zone.

220
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,050
With hordes of refugees

221
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:49,700
and the loss of farmlands
our food shortage is becoming dire.

222
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,700
In order to reclaim our farmlands,

223
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,700
we must restore the broken Outer Wall.

224
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,700
It is to carry out this prestigious mission

225
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,700
that you have all completed your training.

226
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,770
- Weapons Squad Leader Hans.
- Sir!

227
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,000
The days of our being
trampled by Titans are over.

228
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,100
Now we have Omni-Directional Mobility Gear!

229
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:40,000
With ODMG... victory will be ours!

230
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
At the Omotemachi transit point,

231
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,700
we will join the recon
team led by Captain Shikishima.

232
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,500
Captain Shikishima!

233
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
We will depart for Monzen at sunset.

234
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,700
May you fight to honor
the spirits of the war dead.

235
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,900
Give your hearts!

236
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,600
Give your hearts!

237
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,200
I'll be back, so take care of Mom.

238
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,900
The family's in your hands.

239
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Now that's a good daughter.

240
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,900
You were always a glutton,
never making yourself useful.

241
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,100
Sasha, pick'em up!
Pick'em up I said.

242
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,620
- I'm sorry.
- Just do it, Sasha.

243
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,500
Jean, my son, you must take revenge for me.

244
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,620
Jean, become the pride of our clan.

245
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,100
Offer your soul to the spirits of the war dead.
Jean! Jean!

246
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,900
Mommy's only going to be
gone for a little bit, okay!

247
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,700
Just be a good girl and... Riko!

248
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Riko!

249
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,700
Hey, don't cry, little brother..
Hey, hey...

250
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,700
Koyuki, who's this?
Is this supposed to be me?

251
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:12,700
- It's a little fat to be me, no?
- Hey, don't cry, I'll be fine...

252
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Cry baby.

253
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,800
No one's gonna be waiting for us.

254
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Mister.

255
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,400
Here, you can have this.

256
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,900
Thanks.

257
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Koyuki, your brother's leaving now.

258
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,700
Brother...

259
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,700
Koyuki, let's go.

260
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
That's mine!

261
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Mr. Souda.

262
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Armin...

263
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,220
Old man Souda?

264
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,100
Eren?

265
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
So you're alive!

266
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,100
So now...

267
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,450
you boys, too.

268
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,000
Well, everyone died.

269
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,100
What happened to the girl?

270
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,600
It was my fault.

271
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
That's not true.

272
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,200
That's why...
I'm going to get them back.

273
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,100
Revenge on the Titans, eh?

274
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Killing one or two won't
make a difference, you know.

275
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,700
Why did you volunteer, then?

276
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,700
To see my wife and child.

277
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
They're waiting for me.

278
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,800
Excuse me!

279
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,300
What do you want?

280
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
I'm sorry.

281
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,700
Are you finished?

282
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,900
Are you even listening?

283
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,700
Look, right now the Outer Wall in Monzen

284
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,700
has a hole in it like this.

285
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,900
So we detonate this
portion to plug that hole.

286
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
The Wall becomes shorter, but
it's twice as tall as the Titans.

287
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,600
So we can stop any more
Titans from entering.

288
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
That's the Outer Wall Restoration Mission.

289
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,400
Once we plug that hole we
exterminate the Titans inside

290
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Sasha...

291
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,100
But previous restoration
missions failed miserably.

292
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,800
They were attacked by Titans
before reaching the Wall,

293
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,100
and now we are out of explosives.

294
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,000
All that's left are the
last explosives in Omotemachi.

295
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,700
If we fail, that'll be the end of humanity.

296
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,000
We have no choice.

297
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,300
You don't have to.

298
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,200
Pipsqueaks like you just get in the way.

299
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,300
Not just you, look around.

300
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,300
Just a bunch of useless bums.

301
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,700
It's been a long war of attrition.

302
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,400
Inevitably there will be
more inexperienced folks.

303
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Sure.

304
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,100
But even the Scout Regiment
was wiped out in this mission.

305
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,400
Instead we've got...

306
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
a potato girl whose mind
is only on eating...

307
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,600
Seconds, please.

308
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,900
How could you eat right now?

309
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
Sorry, lady.

310
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Not enough farmlands.

311
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,200
But I was told workers
won't ever go hungry.

312
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
How naive are you?

313
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,000
Your parents sold you to save costs.

314
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,300
You all came here because
you couldn't find work.

315
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Now I'm being lumped with
you scum who're just here to die.

316
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,100
Stop with this talk of dying.

317
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,400
I can't... I just can't do this!

318
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,800
Lil, Lil, Lil...

319
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,200
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

320
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,900
Damn lovebirds.
Go somewhere else.

321
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,500
He seems annoyed.

322
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,900
He's afraid of Titans.

323
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,900
You nailed it.

324
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,900
Titans are like nothing to me.

325
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,500
Do Titans have nipples?

326
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,700
Do they have nipples?

327
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,800
You talk big for never having seen one.

328
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,200
Just a spoiled brat from inland.

329
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,400
Say that again.

330
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
They don't!

331
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,600
I told you Titans have
no reproductive organs.

332
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,100
So they have no nipples, either.

333
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,700
How they propagate is a mystery.

334
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,800
I want to dissect one, but
they evaporate when they die.

335
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,400
So I need an alive Titan!

336
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,700
I want to do this!

337
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,600
Gather in 10 minutes for gear check!

338
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,900
Yes!

339
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Oh, that reminds me...

340
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,700
There was a guy who abandoned
his girl when he saw a Titan.

341
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,200
Bet he's missing his nuts, too.

342
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,400
Hey, stop it! Knock it off!

343
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,600
You two, always going at it.

344
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,900
Sannagi, let me down!

345
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,900
Let go of me!

346
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,000
We gather in 10 minutes.

347
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
Hey, pick up the pace!

348
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It'll be okay.

349
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
You're going home.

350
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,100
You're from Monzen, right?

351
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Everyone died.

352
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,100
I want to go home, too.

353
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,100
Sannagi, were you from a Yuen farm?

354
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Yeah. I want to go home and farm again.

355
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,500
For my brothers and sisters

356
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,900
I'd do anything for them.

357
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,700
The old road to Omotemachi.

358
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,900
Titans sleep at night and
their eyes won't work anyway.

359
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,800
So we'll go straight to Omotemachi by dawn.

360
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,900
But do not raise your voices!

361
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,700
Titans are very responsive
to human voices.

362
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
and the other Titans will notice!

363
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,320
Bite your tongue before you scream!

364
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,450
If you don't want to die to
get to Omotemachi by dawn.

365
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,700
Open the gate!

366
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,800
"Abandon all hope, you who enter here."

367
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,300
Past this hell, the Goddess
awaits at Omotemachi.

368
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,400
The Goddess?

369
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:12,020
You don't know? The Titan-slaying
female squad leader under Shikishima.

370
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,300
They say she killed over
10 Titans in half a year.

371
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,100
Sounds more like a Grim Reaper
than a goddess.

372
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,700
- I'm afraid.
- Don't worry.

373
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,400
There's something there.

374
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,800
Stop the vehicles.

375
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
- Already there?
- Awfully early.

376
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,100
What's going on?
This isn't Omotemachi.

377
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,200
Check the premises.

378
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
Move out.

379
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,400
Oh.. come on.

380
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
What is it?

381
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,100
Just cattle.

382
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,500
Do Titans only eat humans?

383
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,300
Forward.
Each squad to the front.

384
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,500
Potato Girl, you'll wake
up the Titans with that noise.

385
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,800
Here.

386
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,900
Not enough?

387
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
You always feed me.

388
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,100
Wait.

389
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,800
Still no Titans coming out.
We should get there by dawn.

390
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Hey, don't say it aloud. You'll jinx us.

391
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
All clear. Let's go.

392
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,600
There's a child...

393
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,900
A child left behind.

394
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,900
Don't be stupid.

395
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,300
We have to help.

396
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
Hey.

397
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
We have to help...

398
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Hiana...

399
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,900
I can hear it.

400
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,900
Shit.

401
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,300
We're close.

402
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
Get up!

403
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
Those idiots...

404
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,000
Where? Where are they?

405
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,600
Hey, keep it down.

406
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,800
You'll wake up the Titans.

407
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,600
Keep calm.

408
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
Keep calm!

409
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
No matter what happens...

410
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,000
don't raise your voices.

411
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Captain!

412
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,300
They brought them.

413
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,200
Director-General!

414
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,200
Go! Go!

415
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,800
Forward!

416
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,100
Hey, wait, we're not on yet!

417
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,100
You guys, wait!

418
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Just run and make it to
the tall buildings up ahead!

419
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,400
We're not fighting them?

420
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,400
- What about the ODMG?
- Where do we fire them?

421
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,800
We can't beat them head on!

422
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,300
Armin!

423
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,460
Sanagi!

424
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,300
Don't raise... your voices...

425
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,900
We're almost there! Run!

426
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,700
We're there!

427
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,600
That's Omotemachi!

428
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,900
Titans are not invincible.

429
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,900
Even if you destroy their limbs or head..
They'll quickly regenerate.

430
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
But this spot right here!

431
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:12,980
If the nape is severely damaged..
It will perish without regenerating.

432
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,500
However, it's difficult
to attack this area with firearms.

433
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:23,400
Currently, our most
effective tool is the ODMG.

434
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:28,200
With this on our hips we can
move quickly and freely in the air.

435
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,400
Fire the anchor and reel
it in to lift yourself up.

436
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,600
Maintain the height as
you aim for the nape.

437
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,200
Of course, remember to
evade the Titan's attacks.

438
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,300
Then use the blades to
carve the flesh from the nape.

439
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,200
Without it's nape, the Titan will die.

440
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:52,700
Once a Titan dies its body will evaporate.

441
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,200
At present this is the only
known method of klling a Titan.

442
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,100
The Scout Regiment!
That's Captain Shikishima

443
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,950
I wouldn't mind a hot
Ttitan chick for once.

444
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,400
We're finished!

445
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,200
I'm tying it.
Hang in there.

446
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,400
Director-General Kubal is here.

447
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,400
You guarded the explosives well.

448
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,800
I attempted to inspect the contents.

449
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
But this was impossible to open.

450
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,500
Director-General, what
about the explosives?

451
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,900
There are rumors of an insurgency,
you see.

452
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,300
I see.

453
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,200
Certainly safe down there.

454
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,600
Sorry, it was top secret.

455
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
Finish loading by dawn!

456
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,600
They're our last explosives.
Treat them with care.

457
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,850
You messed this whole thing up!

458
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,800
If you wanna die, do it alone!

459
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,100
You've got a death wish.

460
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:40,150
You smell, you spoiled brat.

461
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
You peed in your pants, huh?

462
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,400
The Titans scared you?

463
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Stop it!

464
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,600
Stop it!

465
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,100
You're too slow.

466
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,400
You're the one who's slow.

467
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,600
Thanks.

468
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,900
What the hell...

469
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,400
Enough with the disturbance.

470
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,300
Mikasa!

471
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,900
Mikasa, it's you, right?
What happened?

472
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,150
Nice kick...

473
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,800
It's Captain Shikishima!

474
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,850
... for just messing around.

475
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,100
Rookie, your name?

476
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,100
Eren... I'm Eren!

477
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,400
Eren?

478
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,400
From Monzen?

479
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:36,370
Your parents?

480
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,750
They died.
I was too young to remember

481
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,100
I see.

482
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,100
Um, about Mikasa...

483
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,500
Why is she...?

484
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,700
Why?

485
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:52,950
Why what?

486
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,160
Why is she able to toy with Titans?

487
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,200
I taught her.

488
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,250
You want to learn too, huh?

489
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,800
Well, of course... I want
to defeat the Titans.

490
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,390
Why?

491
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,600
Because I hate them... those Titans.

492
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,400
Why do you hate them?

493
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:25,040
Because... they're the
ones who trapped us in.

494
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:29,170
Wrong.

495
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,080
The true enemy...

496
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,040
isn't the Titans.

497
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,700
The true enemy?

498
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,380
The true enemy...

499
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,680
is safety.

500
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,200
What do you call animals that live
inside fences in fear of wolves?

501
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,700
Cattle.

502
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,580
And what are you?

503
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:08,650
I'm...

504
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,440
not!

505
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,880
Then go fly.

506
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,900
Fly?

507
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:24,890
You can only gain by letting go.

508
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,040
The kid I gave this to... he died.

509
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,840
I hear there used to be lots of machines.

510
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,800
People back then even flew the skies.

511
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,400
But now it's forbidden.

512
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,600
Director-General!

513
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:25,650
At ease.

514
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,600
Tell me, did you learn in school...

515
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:34,590
what that technological advancement led to?

516
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,580
Enviromental destruction, wasted resources,
useless competition and war.

517
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,600
Precisely.

518
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,880
Now get yourself some good rest.

519
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:57,090
At daybreak we head for Monzen.

520
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,380
Inspect your gear and rest up

521
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,300
Fighting is the one thing
he was always good at.

522
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,800
You reek of booze.

523
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,600
Why do you hate that guy so much?

524
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:22,200
His face.. as if he's carrying
the world's misery by himself.

525
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,800
He lost his girlfriend, right?

526
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,800
Her name was Mikasa.

527
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,800
Mikasa.

528
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:29,570
I'm just...

529
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,280
glad.

530
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,900
Glad?

531
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,880
That baby was eaten.

532
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,480
And so was I.

533
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:41,290
The world is cruel

534
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,700
I'm just going to kill Titans.

535
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,900
Sorry.

536
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,950
Did I interrupt?

537
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,130
No.

538
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,980
Want it?

539
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It's good.

540
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,250
Calling the Titans again?

541
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:08,850
Sorry.

542
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,450
It should be me apologizing.

543
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,980
Forget it.

544
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,500
What happened between
you and Squad Leader Mikasa?

545
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,900
Still act like a kid, huh?

546
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:40,950
It doesn't matter... anymore.

547
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,700
- There's someone here.
- It's fine, they're not looking.

548
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,800
Hey, wait.

549
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,880
Your back feel okay?

550
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:53,770
Lil, I love you.

551
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I wonder if those two will get to marry.

552
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,460
If they make it home alive.

553
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
It's not right that we
need permission to get married.

554
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:18,030
And even if you have a baby...

555
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:26,030
Riko...

556
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,300
You have a daughter, was it?

557
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,400
By volunteering for duty,
I get child support.

558
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,840
You okay with a single mother?

559
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,100
Will you be father to my daughter?

560
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,900
I don't want to die!
No, let me go!

561
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,500
Riko...

562
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,200
We're surrounded!
We're under attack!

563
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:19,050
We're under attack!
We're under attack!

564
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,080
Lil, Lil! Hurry!

565
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,080
Put on your ODMG!

566
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,400
- Lil, let's go!
- Wait!

567
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,470
Defend the explosives!

568
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:46,450
Too narrow here to fire our anchors!

569
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:48,850
ODMG troops to the rooftop!

570
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:51,250
Damn!

571
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,680
Four ahead, you go left.

572
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Will do.

573
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,080
Quit fidgeting.
At least die with dignity.

574
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,300
Come on, move it!

575
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,100
It's all about the explosives!

576
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:48,450
Defend them at all costs!

577
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:54,050
This side is gone, retreat!

578
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:08,200
Hey, wake up! I said wake up!

579
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,180
Please, wake up...

580
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,400
It's dangerous here, let's go.

581
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:21,100
Wait! Will you please treat him?

582
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,400
I'm sorry, but your boyfriend is...

583
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:31,130
Fukushi...

584
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,770
We have to go.

585
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,900
Let me go! Let me go!

586
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,700
I'll kll them Titans!
I'll kill them!

587
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:52,950
Let's go.

588
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:57,900
Hey.

589
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Who's driving that?

590
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:02,150
No one gave you permssion!

591
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,600
Thief! He's stealing the explosives!

592
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,800
Stop! Stop!

593
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,000
Get out!

594
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,660
Die, you Titans!

595
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:06,090
Stop it! Stop the vehicle!

596
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:07,150
Why's it on fire?

597
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,200
Stop it!

598
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
There you are!

599
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:14,730
I'll kill you all!

600
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:22,390
Get down! Get down!

601
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,400
Fukushi..

602
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,800
How pretty.

603
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:40,490
But such a waste.

604
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,280
The explosives... That was it!

605
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,400
Don't! You're gonna die!

606
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,500
How could this happen?

607
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,300
This belonged to the thief.

608
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:37,260
This is hell...

609
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:45,670
What are you doing here?

610
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,640
Humans are...

611
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,390
weak, you see.

612
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,390
We'll be eaten.

613
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,660
Now's the chance... Let's run.

614
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:18,150
What do you call animals that live
inside fences in fear of wolves?

615
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:19,870
Cattle.

616
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,300
And what are you?

617
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,490
I'm not!

618
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,500
Then go fly.

619
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,840
Then go fly

620
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:35,740
I can't!
There's no way we're going to win!

621
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:40,690
Then be that way for the rest of your life!

622
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Eren!

623
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:00,650
Bastard...

624
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,500
Damnit.

625
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,540
You can't fear being caught!

626
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,740
Fly right into them!

627
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,800
Fly!

628
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,600
Close one.

629
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,400
Always go back to deliver the final blow.

630
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:36,450
I'll do it!

631
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:40,190
You're mine!

632
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:11,740
Well, sometimes we're unlucky.

633
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:21,740
Hey!

634
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,760
Hey, look!

635
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,660
Jean!

636
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:32,190
He only talked big.

637
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,250
Everyone, I have a plan.

638
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:58,050
Pull back...

639
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,740
Hey, big guy! Wanna eat more?

640
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:03,160
Then try eating me!

641
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,240
You can never eat enough!

642
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,940
What, you clunkhead?
You angry, huh?

643
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:11,940
Mr. Souda, please...

644
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,940
Guys...

645
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,260
Come here, Titans!

646
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:21,270
Come on, you slowpokes!
Come over here!

647
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,400
Now!

648
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,460
Don't mess with me!

649
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:08,490
Well done!

650
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:10,490
Good, let's move on!

651
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,490
Where's Eren?

652
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,560
Somewhere up there, dead.

653
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:32,100
Armin!

654
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:07,790
Armin...

655
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,100
Damn, they're not working!

656
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,860
Armin!

657
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,260
Armin!

658
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,400
I won't let you...

659
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,800
die here!

660
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:47,300
Eren!

661
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:50,860
Armin!

662
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Hiana!

663
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,600
I'm driving you all out...

664
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:11,650
Let's get out of here!
It's full of Titans!

665
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,880
Something's calling them.

666
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,040
Where's Captain Shikishima?

667
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,200
Fighting, probably.

668
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:18,250
Where's Director-General
and the Guards?

669
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,500
They already evacuated...

670
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:23,980
Don't tell me...
they used us as bait.

671
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,700
Minami!

672
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,040
Hey, get away, Minami!

673
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,400
Mikasa.

674
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,700
Eren was... eaten.

675
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:56,650
It was my fault.

676
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:04,460
I'm sorry

677
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:19,550
I'll carve an escape path.

678
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:22,860
Our task is still to kill Titans.

679
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:27,770
You can't! You're almost out of gas!

680
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:26,350
Come!

681
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:35,850
What was that noise

682
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:42,580
What's going on?

683
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,200
A Titan attacking a Titan?

684
01:25:55,290 --> 01:25:56,890
What's happening?

685
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:59,590
Look at the regeneration speed!

686
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:14,940
They're gathering here.

687
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,920
Is he on our side?

688
01:27:11,890 --> 01:27:14,690
His fighting clearly
demonstrates intelligence.

689
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:38,290
I've never seen this!

690
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,200
It's him.

691
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:30,990
Mikasa, get back here!

692
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:40,270
Like hell he's on our side!

693
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:43,390
Eren?

694
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:47,540
Is it my fault?

695
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,040
Mikasa!

696
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:29,090
- You okay?
- Can you stand?

697
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:42,340
Is he dead?

698
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,360
So he's finally out of steam.

699
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:47,380
He'll evaporate!
He's gonna evaporate!

700
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:49,790
Ow, it's steaming hot!

701
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,960
Cut open his nape, but
don't injure the inside.

702
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,700
What? What are you talking about?

703
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,600
Just do it! Hurry or he'll
be absorbed into the Titan!

704
01:29:58,270 --> 01:30:00,270
The cells will assimilate!

705
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,800
Is that Eren?

706
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,840
Eren...

707
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:44,730
So that's why the Titans'
weak spot is the nape.

708
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:58,530
"Be careful when you fight the monsters,
unless you become one".
