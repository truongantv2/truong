Test subject readings all normal.

8
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,110
The Psion wave activities are above normal.

9
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,060
All vital readings are within the acceptable range.

10
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,020
Psychedelic reality "Watatsumi" series.. Begin synchronization.

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
Psion waves are normal,

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,220
3, 4, 5 ...

13
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,820
All necessary levels have been reached.

14
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,730
Preparing to activate.

15
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,860
Start the activation process.

16
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,820

All limiters successfully removed, proceeding with the activation process.

21
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,240
Activating Meteorite Fall!

22
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,110
Something that has existed since the war?

23
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,240
It has been a century since magic became a modern technology.

24
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,330
Nations have begun arming themselves with magic,

25
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,640
And they have an enormous amount of power.

26
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,260
With the power to destroy a city,

27
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,020
Those who use magic to fight in the military are called Strategic-Class Magicians,

28
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,840
And they've become a symbol of influence throughout the world.

29
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,460
March 27, Albuquerque International Airport - New Mexico, USA.

30
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,170
Silvi!

31
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,620
Did you come to pick me up?

32
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,510
Welcome back, commander.

33
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,860
Now that I'm not on duty, Lina is fine.

34
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,840
Look here, I bought a ton of souvenirs.

35
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,480
Here.

36
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,930
Ah ... Actually ...

37
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,530
New orders from the General, Commander.

38
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,730
Head to Honolulu right away.

39
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,950
Huh?! I just came back from that stupid mission!

40
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,820
What kind of task is it?

41
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,460
Don't know, when you arrive, you can ask the General.

42
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,970
At least let me take a break!

43
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,860
You can take a break in Honolulu.

44
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,350
We don't know that for sure!

45
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,350
Eh, Hold on ...

46
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,400
Sorry, Lina.

47
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,440
Silvi?

48
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,950
Huh?

49
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,820
Silvi! Wait!

50
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,200
Have a good time!

51
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,860
Thank you for the gifts!

52
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,930
Silvi ... YOU LIAR!

53
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:50,330
March 28, Ogasawara Islands Group of the Mukojima Islands Nadokojima

54
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,640
Delicious isn't it, Onii-sama?

55
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,460
There!

56
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,950
Erika, why do you keep tricking her?

57
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,000
It's more fun that way!

58
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,280
But really, what's the point of hitting a melon with a bat?

59
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,750
Tradition.

60
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,860
Yeah.

61
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,930
Onii-sama ...

62
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,200
Ah ... can I ask you something?

63
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,930
About this new swim suit ...

64
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,840
We chosen it together when we were shopping, remember?

65
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,570
What do you think?

66
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,770
What are you doi-

67
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,530
It suits you very well.

68
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,420
Just as I thought it will.

69
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,600
Thank you very much, Onii-sama.

70
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,330
Shizuku-sama.

71
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,000
I have prepared the dessert.

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,550
Thank you very much, Kurosawa-san.

73
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,020
Come on Honoka.

74
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,220
Yeah.

75
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,750
That was really fun.

76
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,970
Erika cut it perfectly.

77
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,880
Cut?

78
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,280
I thought Mizuki was trying to do it?

79
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,060
Um.

80
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,860
Delicious! this is so delicious Shizuku.

81
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,930
Isn't it, that's Kurosawa's specialty.

82
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,440
There's all kinds of fruits in it.

83
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,440
The atmosphere here is so much fun.

84
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,820
Right.

85
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,400
I look forward to that!

86
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,570
Hey, Miyuki you look forward to it too, right?

87
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,680
Hmm.. sure, why not.

88
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,440
Tatsuya-san and Miyuki, thank you.

89
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,620
What's this all of sudden?

90
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,930
Um, what do you mean by thank you?

91
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,150
What's the matter, Shizuku?

92
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,400
For suddenly inviting everyone ...

93
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,310
Thanks to you everyone gathered on summer vacation.

94
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,930
If anything, we're grateful you invited us.

95
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,660
Here you go.

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,910
Onii-sama, that's ...

97
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,600
A rare sight.

98
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,260
A special unit of the Ministry of Defense.

99
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,200
Onii-sama?

100
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
It's an order from the military.

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,750
Miyuki.

102
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,820
My limiters, if you would please..

103
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,860
Huh? But that's…

104
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,080
It's an order that requires the use of Material Burst.

105
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,170
This may also be related to the Yotsuba clan's reputation.

106
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,280
I understand.

107
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,370
What our Aunt says doesn't matter to me, However for your sake, I'd be glad to.

108
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,080
At ease.

109
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,680
Yes sir.

110
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,950
Onto the task on hand.

111
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:31,110
Between the orbit of the Earth and Mars should be empty space.

112
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,640
However we've discovered an asteroid orbit that changed course recently.

113
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,130
Abnormal.

114
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,600
The orbit suddenly changed course.

115
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,350
And it is now on a collision course with Earth.

116
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,770
According to our calculations, there is over a 90% chance of colliding with Earth.

117
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,460
So your saying collision is imminent?

118
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,840
Right.

119
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:02,440
Asteroid 2095GE9 codename: Sieg.

120
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:10,040
The calculated trajectory and point of impact is on the East China Sea.

121
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,750
As for Japan, the Kyushu area will be severely affected.

122
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,770
We cannot let that happen.

123
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,480
Therefore, Special Officer Ooguro of the 101st Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion is ordered the following:

124
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,440
Authorized use of the Third Eye - Material Burst, Obliterate the following target: Sieg.

125
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,950
Asteroid 2095GE9: destruction confirmed.

126
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,370
A sniper from the ground?

127
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,680
So they intervened ...

128
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,420
Although, there's not enough data.

129
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,800
It's not necessary to continue.

130
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,930
Next is the orbital navigation experiment.

131
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,170
One day ... no, tomorrow.

132
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:05,020
The experiment will take place on March 30 at 19h00.

133
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,710
It's finally time.

134
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,530
If this experiment succeeds,
the Navy will finally have to recognize us.

135
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,200
Wait, Chief!

136
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,240
The experiments take a toll on these kids. They need more time to recover!

137
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,820
At least one more week before we continue the experiment!

138
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,150
Morinaga.

139
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,530
Is there any evidence that the kids recover after a week?

140
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,510
I do not remember having that data.

141
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,240
But, that's ...

142
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,880
A scientist should not let emotions overwhelm him/her

143
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,060
while making important decisions.

144
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,840
The experiment will go on as planned.

145
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,420
It will not be delayed for any reason.

146
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,420
March 29, Chichijima Island, Ogasawara Subprefecture.

146
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,220
Who could this be?

147
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,840
WTF is this mail?!

148
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,110
Mari, get up!

149
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,110
Look at this.

150
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,400
It's still early…

151
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
It's morning already.

152
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,800
Look.

153
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,930
Bitter…

154
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
This is…?

155
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,930
So that must be the Naval Base Honmaru?

156
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,330
Having a shopping mall built next to it, means..

157
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,330
This is still a private island, right?

158
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:26,330
Although this is a military area, there are still private establishments that sign contracts for business.

159
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,660
In the same area but still separate.

160
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,730
Yoshida-kun, Leo-kun!

161
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,240
We're going to have lunch.

162
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,280
Oh, finally!

163
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,250
We've been waiting forever!

164
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,940
Huh?! If that's all it takes for you to complain, then you still have a long way to go.

165
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,310
That doesn't even make any sense.

166
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,570
What kind of excercise is this anyway?

166
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,000
Hey everyone! What should we ea-

167
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,880
Mayumi!

168
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,250
Did you find anything?

169
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,710
Nothing yet.

170
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,880
I'll look over there.

171
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,280
Please do!

172
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,140
Mizuki and Tatsuya-kun are together in the Magical Engineering Department.

173
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,280
Miki became a bloom.

174
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,680
Hey Miki ... what's it feel like to be a bloom?

175
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,370
Give me a break please.

176
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,340
Bloom and Weeds are not much any different.

177
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,250
What's the matter, Leo?

178
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,940
There is something ... going on out there.

179
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,650
Guards?

180
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,080
No, military police?

181
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,510
Are the soldiers allowed out of the base?

182
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,710
Unusual.

183
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,910
I feel something is wrong.

184
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,420
It's best we hurry back to the villa.

185
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,620
I agree, it's a bit sooner than expected but.. shall we?

186
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,770
The door is open?

187
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,820
Ah, sorry.

188
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,140
He was sleeping.

189
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,420
Oh my…

190
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,340
Well, he's a good pilot, at least.

191
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,910
Search the plane!

192
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,660
Those inside the plane!

193
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,420
Open the door!

194
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,740
These guys ...

195
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,480
Erika?

196
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,480
What seems to be the problem?

197
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,800
L-Lady Erika?

198
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,510
You…

199
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,570
What do you want with this plane?

200
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,570
I heard something about a search warrant?

201
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,850
Yes ... it seems like a patient has escaped from the base.

202
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,970
Seem..?

203
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,140
Y-Yes!

204
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,710
We've been informed so!

205
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,710
Not on this plane.

206
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,280
But ...

207
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,170
If you could at least let us perform a quick search..

208
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,450
Did you not hear me?!

209
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,730
Or maybe..

210
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,500
... you do not believe my words, is that it?!

211
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,600
N-Not at all, please excuse us!

212
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,820
Hey, that's enough let's go.

213
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,740
Are those soldiers earlier from the Chiba branch?

214
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,250
Hmm, pretty much.

215
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,140
They seem to have forgotten my face.

216
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,880
By the way, Erika.

217
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,770
Why did you cover for her?

218
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,770
Hmm, you noticed too?

219
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,050
You can come out now.

220
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,420
Come on.

221
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,020
It's safe to come out now.

222
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,140
Welcome back, Mademoiselle.

223
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,310
I'm back, Takeuchi-san.

224
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,820
Did my guest arrive?

225
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,570
According to the description provided...

226
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,170
... has yet to appear.

227
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,400
I see.

228
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,220
Instead, two marine soldiers arrived.

229
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,080
They said they were looking for a patient that escaped from the base.

230
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,200
But after finding nothing, they left.

231
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,740
Is that so.

232
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,710
However, where on earth did she go?

233
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,970
She didn't show up in the appointed time.

234
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,540
Any possibility she might've been caught?

235
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,680
Right now, there's still a number of guards around the terminal, probably..

236
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,740
...means she hasn't been captured yet.

237
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,220
Mademoiselle, I have something to say.

238
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,680
What is it?

239
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:18,220
There was another plane about 100 meters away.

240
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,680
There's a possiblity she got on the wrong plane.

241
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,740
Find out where that plane went!

242
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,680
The sooner the better!

243
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Onii-sama!

244
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
You're already back.

245
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,370
Yeah, about an hour ago.

246
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,220
You all came back sooner than planned?

247
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220
Ah, Tatsuya-san!

248
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,940
Oh, you're back?

249
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,970
Thanks for your hard work.

250
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,940
Yeah.

251
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,000
Who's the girl?

252
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,400
Let see…

253
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,650
What's your name?

254
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,510
Kokoa.

255
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,110
Kokoa?

256
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,170
How old are you?

257
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,140
I'm ... Fourteen.

258
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,880
14?!

259
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,250
I'd imagine her being younger.

260
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:01,400
Did you run away from the Naval Base?

261
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,850
No..

262
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,740
Experiments...laboratory.

263
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,600
What kind of experiments?

264
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,310
Terrible magical experiments.

265
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,800
Are you a mage, Kokoa?

266
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,000
Mage?

267
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,050
Mages are people with magical abilities.

268
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,310
Are you not a magician?

269
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,600
We are...

270
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:42,170
... called the Watatsumi series.

271
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,170
Onii-sama.

272
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,540
I know, human cloning ... most probably.

273
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,800
Can you tell us what kind of experiments did they make you do in the laboratory?

274
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,620
Sometimes we are put into a big machine.

275
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,450
A big machine?

276
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,880
Probably ... a large CAD device.

277
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:33,280
Using the large CAD,
They can activate and control the magical sequences of the person inside the machine.

278
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,110
And they're basically just a part of that CAD.

279
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:43,910
Kokoa was created for some purpose.

280
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,140
So she's just like a replacement part for a machine?

281
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,910
What made you decide to escape?

282
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,020
Someone told me to run away ...

283
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,220
Who?

284
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,710
Morinaga-san.

285
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,740
A female researcher ...

286
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,620
Why did she tell you to run away?

287
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,340
Yes.

288
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,620
Kokoa ...

289
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,740
Kokoa.

290
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,310
Run!

291
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:37,220
If you continue the experiments, you'll lose your entire personality...you'll become an empty doll.

292
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,910
But before that happens...

293
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,910
We've got to do something ...

294
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
Loss of personality?

295
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,000
Tatsuya-kun, is something like that even possible?

296
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,000
It's not impossible.

297
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,940
Kokoa.

298
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,140
Not like that, Tatsuya-san! You're scaring Kokoa-chan.

299
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,510
Oh, I'm sorry, Honoka. I didn't mean to scare her.

300
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:13,200
Ask her if she's the only test subject for the CAD experiments?

301
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:20,280
Kokoa-chan, are you the only one in the machine?

302
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,400
No…

303
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,080
We ...

304
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,250
By we... she probably means the entire Watatsumi series.

305
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:36,820
When you said we, does that mean there are more of you?

306
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,140
Yes…

307
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,370
There are 9 of us ...

308
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,910
So there's a total of 9 in the Watatsumi series..

309
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,540
After you left the machine, how did you feel?

310
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,680
Feel?

311
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,480
Relief.

312
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,310
It's like I was about to melt away...

313
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,140
What's melting away?

314
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,800
We ...

315
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,450
Missing ... inside

316
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,650
Self-loss, in other words... complete loss of emotions.

317
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,540
No way!

318
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,310
In order to activate large-scale spells,

319
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:36,600
Forced coercion may be required.

320
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,510
I heard several rumors of certain organizations that are researching it.

321
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,680
Most likely they're the ones responsible for leading these experiments.

322
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,140
That's insane!

323
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,880
With no regard for a persons life, how could they do such a thing?!

324
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,020
Please...

325
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,400
Save.

326
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,400
Rest assured.

327
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:23,420


328
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,740
They can't take you from here.

329
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,110
I'll keep you safe no matter what happens.

330
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,110
No..

331
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,820
Save...

331
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,220
Us...please.

332
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,850
Us?

333
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,200
You want to help the rest that are still held captive in the lab, right?

334
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,770
Yes...

335
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:57,080
If we try to rescue the remaining research subjects sponsored by the Navy..

336
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,570
It's certain to cause a lot of problems.

337
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,250
Even so, we need to do something!

338
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,510
If Honoka wants to save them then I'll help too.

339
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,530
You already know how determined I am, right? There's no turning back now.

340
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,600
Of course, I'll be lending a hand too.

341
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,330
I don't mind helping too, but ...

342
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:31,340
Shibata, Kitayama and Mitsui should stay because it'll be dangerous.

343
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,770
Oh my, so you'll be fine with me joining then?

344
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,450
Eh?!

345
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,080
That's true..

346
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
After all, Miyuki is so powerful, it's terrifying.

347
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,280
Erika, is there something you want to tell me?

348
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
Nothing … really.

349
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,940
Just kidding.

350
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,740
Yoshida-kun, I'll be fine.

351
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,620
Please go and help Kokoa-chan.

352
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,910
Shibata-san?

353
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,080
Yeah, I understand.

354
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,110
Onii-sama.

355
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:08,340
I also want to help Kokoa-chan.

356
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,740
Understood, let's do this together.

357
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,170
Order from General Department.

358
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,450
We are ordered to destroy the magic base, the object of study

359
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:55,740
and all the research assistants for the Japanese Navy.

360
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:02,910
Do you think that this facility is dangerous to our country?

361
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,770
To the whole world.

362
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:14,800
This base of research is a kind of spell that goes beyond the Earth.

363
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,680
If it is enabled,

364
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:31,170
a city can disappear immediately, it is very dangerous.

365
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:37,200
The commander, we must destroy the research base, but that ...

366
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,020
Should we destroy the brains of researchers?

367
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,650
Order is completely destroyed.

368
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,600
Also I did not hear any more.

369
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,340
That is, depending on your decision ...

370
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:00,140
Ralph, depending on the decision of the top people here is the commander.

371
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,400
Know the captain. I do not do too much.

372
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,820
That's all.

373
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,800
Start a campaign.

374
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,800
Our mission will begin 27 hours from now,

375
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:19,710
Me and Hardy will attack directly from the submarine base.

376
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,510
In short, I would destroy the defenses of that place with my magic.

377
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,420
Hardy will help me.

378
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:34,970
Ben and Ralph will invade the island with Thrust Suit.

379
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,450
Destroy and destroy the rest of the base.

380
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,710
But if all is destroyed then withdraw immediately.

381
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:49,570
For sure, I'll blow it all up with Heavy Metal Burst.

382
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,080
Are you allowed to use that level of magic?

383
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,310
This is evidence that this threat is extremely dangerous, should be removed immediately.

384
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:07,200
The superior will not tolerate those who study the magical threat to the whole world.

385
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,450
The Japanese army will also understand that.

386
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,820
Yes.

387
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,650
Tateshima Island has become a military base.

388
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,280
People are asked to leave after sunset.

389
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,250
It is necessary to reduce the number of casualties.

390
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,480
Then prepare for the campaign!

391
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,050
Going too!

392
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,800
True!

393
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,770
Do you see Kokoa-chan?

394
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,570
Let me help you!

395
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,680
Erika is ...

396
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,680
You're out of sight.

397
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,170
Do it clean!

398
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,970
Out of capacity always!

399
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,540
Feeling so happy?

400
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,110
Do not bully him anymore!

401
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,020
Let me wash it for you.

402
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,110
Kokoa, close your eyes.

403
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,940
Is it okay?

404
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,710
Honoka, what is this?

405
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,110
Oil calls it.

406
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,170
Do not you know?

407
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,140
Do not know…

408
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,510
This is also the first time swimming in the aquarium ...

409
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,140
Aquarium?

410
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Kokoa, did not you take a hot shower?

411
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,080
Yes…

412
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,310
Always use sterile tanks ...

413
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,710
Then go try it, it is fun.

414
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:59,850
With girls washing is not only to clean the body,
It also makes us beautiful.

415
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,050
Today you will make me beautiful.

416
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,050
So quick, huh.

417
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,280
Are everyone prepared together?

418
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,450
Where is Kurosawa?

419
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,740
Going to work is important.

420
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,250
Important?

421
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,480
Actually…

422
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,800
That's beautiful, Kokoa.

423
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,480
Good luck when you wear it.

424
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,480
So have dinner.

425
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,710
Um.

426
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,400
Kokoa, what's up?

427
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,710
Where is Saegusa Mayumi?

428
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,200
Saegusa Mayumi ... Are you Saegusa?

429
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,280
She is not here.

430
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,170
What do you need to find her?

431
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:23,000
Morinaga says to find Saegusa Mayumi for help ...

432
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,200
Is she?

433
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,110
That plane was not Saegusa Mayumi's?

434
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:38,220
Remember, there was also a plane with us.

435
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,770
Please tell me soon.

436
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,450
Who cares!

437
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:47,200
Did she get confused with Saegusa's plane?

438
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,770
It looks like that.

439
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,170
Maybe she is resting after graduation.

440
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,400
Onii-sama.

441
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,420
I think she's worried.

442
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:03,220
If so, I would like to send a message or call a message.

443
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,970
Yes.

444
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,570
Thanks to you, Miyuki.

445
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,620
I know.

446
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,650
Everybody.

447
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,050
It's time for dinner.

448
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,280
- Looks delicious!
 - Let's eat!

449
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,280
Onii-sama.

450
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,940
Can you sit?

451
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,850
No problem. Sit down.

452
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,140
Tomorrow he will go to the Magic Society and Masumigaura headquarters.

453
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,400
Yes.

454
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:11,080
Obviously, confronted with the Navy.

455
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,570
Is it possible to save Kokoa?

456
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,080
Though it's just sympathy, it's not a temporary feeling, is it?

457
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,110
That…

458
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,280
I want to do it.

459
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,200
He did not want to abandon her.

460
00:40:54,140 --> 00:41:00,340
He was not supposed to be sympathetic, but ...

461
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:14,170
I think it's not bad for me.

462
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,310
There are some things that make you curious about Kokoa.

463
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:45,280
Using the human body as part of the giant CAD ...

464
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:52,450
Such secret scientific research can destroy the most important part of humanity.

465
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,250
This can not be forgiven.

466
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,540
You feel that way.

467
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,600
Thank you for setting up this special clothing.

468
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,480
Captain Sanada.

469
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,400
No problem, this is also a great opportunity to test it.

470
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,480
Did you come to the Association?

471
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,570
Because they want to hear the report from me.

472
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,510
About the next plan, all must go through them.

473
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:57,510
As a waiter for them, you can not ignore it, right?

474
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:03,540
Decisions for people over 18 years of military service must pass them.

475
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,910
... but was violated by the military.

476
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,650
I'm only 16.

477
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,450
That's it.

478
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,770
Ah yes.

479
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,850
Take it with you.

480
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,970
This is Deep and Beta memory?

481
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:27,340
Deep is fine, but Beta is still testing,
Take it to the battlefield is not it?

482
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:32,250
He also wants to collect data.

483
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,200
Just like thanks for the dedicated clothes.

484
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,710
Clear.

485
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:41,250
So be careful, Lieutenant.

486
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,850
I'm comming home.

487
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,880
Ừ.

488
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,170
Is she here?

489
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,420
Yes, just before.

490
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,620
Are you Watatsumi Kokoa?

491
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:14,880
Watatsumi series, code 22, alias Kokoa ...

492
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,140
Is your sister Saegusa Mayumi?

493
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,600
Yes, you are.

494
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,420
Sorry yesterday for not saving me.

495
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,140
Thank you.

496
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,570
What's your relationship?

497
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:40,680
Morinaga was her mentor during her secret research in the Navy,

498
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:49,340
But feeling unacceptable, she rescued Kokoa.

499
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,970
So that's it.

500
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,140
So come to Tokyo with me.

501
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,680
About that, I want to discuss with you.

502
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,800
What?

503
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:10,020
Not just Kokoa, do you want me to bring people to Tokyo?

504
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,020
Except me?

505
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,480
It's correct.

506
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,910
Ah, Shizuku ...

507
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,200
Star?

508
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,910
Can I borrow the Kitayama house?

509
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,220
For what?

510
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:28,310
There are still 8 other people besides Kokoa.

511
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,740
Tatsuya, what are you going to do?

512
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,280
Did you try to save them?

513
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,340
Yes.

514
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,310
I understand.

515
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:38,510
Mayumi?

516
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:43,170
Our mission is to bring Kokoa to Tokyo.

517
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,420
Also, nothing else.

518
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,620
That is, we will only interfere ...

519
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,050
Not.

520
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:55,310
Tatsuya's idea is that our enemy should not face.

521
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,820
Understood.

522
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,220
Beware that Tatsuya.

523
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,200
I will not get you caught.

524
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,450
Again, I do not think you're alone
Could rescue those 8 children.

525
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,020
It is not enough for one person.

526
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,570
Add me in again.

527
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:29,850
I do not think you two obeyed obediently.

528
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:30,770
Of course.

529
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,740
It is rare to see the same opinion.

530
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,280
Me too!

531
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,450
Onii-sama.

532
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:39,200
Need someone to stay at the Shizuku plane?

533
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,540
If so, I will stay.

534
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:46,370
Then Yoshida, you and me hold the plane?

535
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:49,570
Did you see that?

536
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,880
Understood.

537
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,710
Mikihiko, thanks for you.

538
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,970
Um.

539
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:01,000
A great vacation.

540
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,600
Honestly.

541
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,000
Please do not be too aggressive.

542
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,880
Erika, what is it?

543
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,650
Well, the miniature version of Orochimaru.

544
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,170
Mizuchimaru.

545
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,200
I hid it in Shizuku's plane.

546
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,050
You always prepare well.

547
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:24,020
Who knows what happens.

548
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,770
Then two people.

549
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,340
Yes, please be careful.

550
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,220
This kokoa, looks good to me.

551
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,910
Cute.

552
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,450
JA8594 aircraft.

553
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:50,200
Immediately return to Minami Tateshima Island.

554
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,220
How do we do this, lady?

555
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,800
Ignore them.

556
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,020
JA8594.

557
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,570
Come back!

558
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,820
There is no other way.

559
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,280
This is JA8594.

560
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,940
Sorry but we will not come back.

561
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,400
If back there will not be enough fuel.

562
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,050
Do not have a hunch!

563
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,970
Minami Tateshima Island is closer to Haneda Airport!

564
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:33,710
But if we return, we will not have enough fuel to fly to Tokyo.

565
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:39,280
JA8594, do not say much. Go back!

566
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,140
But not enough fuel ...

567
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:50,140
JA8594, this is the last warning.

568
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,710
Next shot will be real.

569
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,710
We are serious.

570
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,110
That's very disturbing.

571
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,340
Just a warning.

572
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,420
Next shot will be real.

573
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,680
I'm not kidding.

574
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,360
Can you wait here?

575
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,930
I got it.

576
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,130
Had two wait.

577
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,130
Both wear this set.

578
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,330
Hey, Tatsuya.

579
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,100
How did you get these?

580
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,000
Curious?

581
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
No, no.

582
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,460
Done.

583
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,860
Huh?

584
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,630
Tatsuya, that is ...

585
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,160
Secret weapon.

586
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,660
Erika, Leo, I will send the information to.

587
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,530
I found the research site.

588
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:32,460
Got it?

589
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:38,230
It looks like the lab is located in this area.

590
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:42,200
I will go ahead to rescue you Kokoa,

591
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,460
The two of you will lead the kids to the boat.

592
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:01,400
Confirmation is still civilians or not?

593
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,600
No sign of civilians.

594
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,030
True to the plan.

595
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,760
So plan your trip.

596
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,200
Yes madam!

597
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,730
Your ship is entering the territory without permission.

598
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:36,130
Get out of the area quickly.

599
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:40,930
Remember, quickly leave the area.

600
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,530
No, they are still entering.

601
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,730
Launch missile defense.

602
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,060
Will we destroy it?

603
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,060
It is a threat.

604
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,030
All at my command!

605
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,760
Confirm missile defense.

606
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,900
I will send the coordinates.

607
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,960
Confirm coordinates.

608
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,600
Target:Rocket Launch System.

609
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:26,330
Activate Heavy Metal Burst!

610
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:45,800
This shock?

611
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:18,260
The commander made a little too much then.

612
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,700
Ralph, do not laugh!

613
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,130
But the captain ...

614
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:27,960
How can we penetrate?

615
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,530
True…

616
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:38,360
Lina's Heavy Metal Burst?

617
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,400
Why are stars here?

618
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,100
He was still, not holding hands.

619
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,830
Fire?

620
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,430
There's something wrong.

621
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:06,260
I do not understand, but this is the opportunity!

622
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,960
Have successfully penetrated their communications networks.

623
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:18,130
Is there a report about the appearance of a strange submarine?

624
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,000
I also heard.

625
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Be informed of evacuation orders for civilians!

626
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,500
It seems they were attacked from a submarine,

627
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,530
It caused damage to the Navy.

628
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,430
An evacuation order has been issued.

629
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,730
Who are you?

630
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,930
Do you know Kokoa?

631
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,860
Do you know Kokoa?

632
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,600
Is she okay?

633
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,900
Stay safe.

634
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,200
You are Morinaga?

635
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,930
It's correct. It's me.

636
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:24,600
You were arrested for liberating Kokoa?

637
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,860
No problem.

638
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,330
If I run away, he will not let me live.

639
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:37,030
We were asked by Kokoa to save eight more.

640
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,800
Will you save the kids?

641
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,160
Please!

642
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,400
Save them all, leave me again!

643
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,500
Please save them!

644
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:52,830
If you worry about them, why do you experiment?

645
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,660
Linking with such great magic will not produce any good results.

646
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:02,600
As you say.

647
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,800
We were too arrogant.

648
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,000
No, too hasty.

649
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,260
That magic can destroy the big countries in the Alliance.

650
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,200
The great destructive power that it brings ...

651
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:22,630
... makes the Navy covet.

652
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,430
We think so too.

653
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,800
But that's our sin.

654
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,630
They are sacrifices.

655
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:38,230
If I save them, then I have a shelf!

656
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:40,630
So ...

657
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:44,500
Where are the remaining eight?

658
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,600
I will lead the way.

659
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,530
They are probably doing experiments.

660
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:54,560
What kind of magic are you experimenting with?

661
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:01,030
We make Meteorite Fall, an asteroid bomb.

662
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:07,160
It can change the orbit of the asteroid towards the Earth.

663
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,060
Small planet?

664
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:16,400
The strange move of asteroid 2095GE9 two days ago ...
Is your work?

665
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,030
Right.

666
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,060
Why do you know that?

667
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:28,460
We should not use the elevator.

668
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,030
The experiment is about the ability to move the orbit.

669
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:37,730
If the asteroid's orbit can be reversed,

670
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:44,030
In the future, we will avoid the risk of losing control of the Earth,

671
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:47,700
We will use it to push the satellite out of Earth orbit.

672
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:56,030
But the satellite will be burned in the atmosphere.

673
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:01,030
What does it take to change its orbit?

674
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,360
Our goal this time is ...

675
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:12,630
USNA satellite, military satellite Sevens Plague.

676
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,330
What?

677
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,230
Was the head of this experiment insane?

678
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:20,600
That satellite contains about 60 tons of uranium.

679
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:28,260
If it fails and the satellite falls, the damage will not be counted!

680
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:37,230
Destruction would be equivalent to 30 nuclear missiles and destroying everything,

681
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:40,360
World war will inevitably.

682
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,360
Impossible!
Wrong step.

683
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,230
It can not be wrong.

684
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,300
What to do ?!

685
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,100
Why is this happening?

686
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,200
Did not confirm wrong?

687
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,700
You are the one who confirmed.

688
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,900
Director, what is this?

689
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,760
Morinaga?

690
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,400
Director, what happened?

691
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,400
Maybe ... he failed?

692
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:09,130
The Sevens Plague will fall down in 24 hours.

693
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:12,530
I said that?!

694
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:18,630
Initially, this experiment required 12 newcomers. Only with 8 is impossible!

695
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:22,300
The process is completely accurate.

696
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,930
The experiment is perfect.

697
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:30,230
This data will play an important role in subsequent experiments.

698
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,060
Do not be kidding!

699
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,430
No next time!

700
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:35,660
That's enough!

701
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:40,000
This result ...

702
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,330
... was due to a sudden explosion.

703
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:49,500
Due to the impact of the explosion on the base,
 Activation of the magic becomes chaotic.

704
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,100
Is the fault of the flood intrusion!

705
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,800
Do you really think so?

706
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,560
I'm not wrong.

707
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,100
Correct.

708
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,230
I'm not wrong.

709
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,300
The experiment is over.

710
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,330
You do not need to hold them anymore, right?

711
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,430
Sia!

712
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,430
Come back soon, Sia!

713
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,200
Who?

714
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,000
He was asked by Kokoa.

715
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,330
Kokoa?

716
01:00:57,330 --> 01:01:00,330
She wants him to save you.

717
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:02,630
Is that okay?

718
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,330
Just want them to be ...

719
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,030
Please ... save us.

720
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,900
Tatsuya!

721
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,430
Erica, Leo!

722
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,860
May meet.

723
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,460
Thanks for taking care of these people.

724
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,930
She is Morinaga.

725
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:37,130
Thanks?

726
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:37,730
Where are you going?

727
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:38,900
Brother.

728
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,900
Do we abandon us?

729
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:49,730
The data is still there so the children are still not saved.

730
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,630
They just need to create more people like you are finished.

731
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:57,260
If so, go!

732
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,230
Let us worry.

733
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,730
Go ahead!

734
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,530
I will go later.

735
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,860
Still here?

736
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,830
What are you doing here?

737
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:21,500
Transfer the Sevens Plague data here fast.

738
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,460
What do we have to do?

739
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:28,130
Let me say this, whether or not I still get it.

740
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:32,760
But I do not want to waste time asking you.

741
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,260
Finished yet?

742
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:51,030
Already.

743
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,500
Hey, what are you doing?

744
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,260
Delete!

745
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,130
Stop!

746
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,930
Careful!

747
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,600
Be careful!

748
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,030
No, come back soon!

749
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,030
Oh, military scene?

750
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,700
Not a Mobable Dress ...

751
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,160
Who are you ?!

752
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,200
That young man is ...

753
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,360
Ralph, those are the key men of Meteorite Fall!

754
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,430
So that is ...

755
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:46,400
Can I kill them?

756
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:48,760
Do it.

757
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:53,300
Obey!

758
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,930
Hurry back!

759
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:57,360
Morinaga, thanks for you!

760
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,830
You, this way!

761
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,500
Do not rush.

762
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,530
They will slowly enjoy it.

763
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:28,160
Looks like I will be your opponent.

764
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,460
Siegfried!

765
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,030
You made me happy.

766
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,030
Crazy guy

767
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,760
Ralph, this idiot!

768
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,960
Why stop the attack?

769
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:12,960
Because I felt something was wrong with his sword.

770
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,760
Move like Lina?

771
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,630
Are you Stars?

772
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:27,630
So that's it.

773
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:31,830
Ladies of the Chiba family in the command post here.

774
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:42,430
Shut up! You're so mouthy.

775
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,930
Dead!

776
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,700
Juumonji ?!

777
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:12,600
Katsuo Juumonji ?!

778
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,400
Saijou, Chiba?

779
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,000
What are you guys doing here?

780
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,430
What is that suit?

781
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:20,400
This is…

782
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:05,530
Is this PhalanX of Katsuo Juuminji?

783
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,960
He is the special forces of Stars.

784
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,760
Why come to Japan?

785
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:41,660
Shut up, Kirikage!

786
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:15,630
Very sorry, commander.

787
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:16,860
We have failed.

788
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,930
Ben, are you ...?

789
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,260
No ... was clear.

790
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:23,760
Move to stage 2.

791
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,460
Mirphak, the system has recovered?

792
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,330
Not yet.

793
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:32,060
So I will attack directly from the sky.

794
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:51,260
According to data obtained from the experimental site,

795
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:56,230
can now see the Sevens Plague.

796
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:09,000
If you attack with Material Burst, the fragments will fall down.

797
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:15,060
To prevent the contamination of uranium and neutron emission,

798
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,460
You must destroy them with Beta Trident.

799
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:28,400
Have not seen Sevens Plague yet?

800
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,060
What's up?

801
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,860
That is?

802
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,230
Rope?

803
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:42,030
Unlock.

804
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,930
Ready.

805
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:50,700
At times, but also work excessively ...

806
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:55,860
There are Erika and Leo, but civilians too!

807
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,500
Heavy Metal Burst, fire!

808
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,760
Disperse mist ...

809
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,400
Fire!

810
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,730
Huh?

811
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:21,300
Heavy Metal Burst destroyed?

812
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,460
Plasma transmission ...

813
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,160
Target…

814
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:33,430
What is happening…

815
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,760
All of them were taken to the shelter.

816
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,930
Activated disperse fog.

817
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:20,460
Looks like ... finished the task?

818
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:33,230
Satellite image is back to normal.

819
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:34,930
Put the image on the screen.

820
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,930
Commander, there is a message from the ship's center.

821
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,060
Read it.

822
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:46,000
Military satellite, Sevens confirmed plague is falling?

823
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:47,600
How about the following?

824
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,930
Well ... the location is ...

825
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:55,130
The latitude is 27 plus minus 5, longitude is 142 plus minus 5.

826
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,400
Head office.

827
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,700
What is the directive of the superiors?

828
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:07,860
All fleet is in the Pacific
Must return to Hawaii base within 48 hours.

829
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,300
Orders can not be made.

830
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,500
Transmit command to withdraw!

831
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,230
As soon as possible.

832
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:16,230
Clear!

833
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:17,200
Commander.

834
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,330
What is up?

835
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:25,060
I would like to use a ground missile.

836
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,100
Can you get closer?

837
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,800
Huh? It's on fire!

838
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,830
Where not.

839
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,360
What is up?

840
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:46,560
Please stop here.

841
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:09,630
Then I go ahead.

842
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:21,000
Tate, shut the door!

843
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:34,530
I know that he will not have anything ...

844
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:41,400
But at least this is what I can do.

845
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:44,860
Freeze.

846
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:48,600
What's going on?

847
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,930
Is ice

848
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:56,030
The ship is ...

849
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,630
stuck in a sea of ​​ice ...

850
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,900
This is…?

851
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,000
Command!

852
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,130
Hardy, I'm going to rescue the New Mexico.

853
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:13,960
Look at the enemy magician.

854
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:23,860
You can only do this ...

855
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:25,860
Miyuki?

856
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,160
Did not hear anything ... New Mexico?

857
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,030
This is Sirius.

858
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:44,530
Commander, this is Canopus.

859
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:46,630
I will thaw.

860
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:50,560
Once they are moving, they will withdraw immediately.

861
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,900
Muspelheim!

862
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:18,960
Rope!

863
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,960
Yes, Lina?

864
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,160
This voice ... Tatsuya?

865
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:28,600
Do you know the US military satellite?

866
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,630
Why? What about that?

867
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,800
It will fall to Earth.

868
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,900
Is it?

869
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:39,700
The withdrawal order has been issued.

870
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,860
Come on! Umi no Yamada!

871
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,500
What the hell?

872
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,230
Really?

873
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:13,430
You can confirm.

874
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:16,630
Ben, sorry, I disconnected a bit.

875
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:18,130
Rina.

876
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:22,860
Please join me to destroy the Sevens Plague.

877
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:27,760
I need you to work together.

878
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,560
What is it?

879
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:38,430
I have trouble observing
 This is to prevent his Heavy Metal Burst.

880
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:40,400
What should I do?

881
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:55,560
Miyuki?

882
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,500
Onii-sama?

883
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,960
I will come to you right away!

884
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,730
Lina will come too so do not attack.

885
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:04,700
How come Lina?

886
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,360
You need Lina's power?

887
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,360
I have understood.

888
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:13,660
I will wait for you, Onii-sama.

889
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:28,060
In 24 hours?

890
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:36,860
Lina, I want you to take me up to 140km.

891
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:39,530
In about 10 minutes.

892
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:42,960
140km is out of space then what?

893
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,800
To stop it, just to the stratosphere is enough?

894
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:52,600
The magic I'm about to make can not be done many times.

895
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,030
Can only be done once.

896
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:59,330
So I want to be sure to succeed.

897
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:02,260
Well ... you can not do it?

898
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:04,200
Okay!

899
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:09,030
I'll take you to that height perfectly!

900
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,100
But even when I'm back, it's not enough to keep you.

901
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,130
So I want to ask you, Miyuki.

902
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:23,330
Miyuki, you will be in free fall.

903
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:25,930
Can you help me?

904
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:29,030
Leave me alone, Onii-sama.

905
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:34,960
I will use my best to catch you safely.

906
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,100
Thanks to you, Miyuki.

907
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,100
Yes.

908
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,100
Finished yet?

909
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,830
Anytime.

910
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:52,600
Ok.

911
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:22,460
5.

912
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:27,800
4.

913
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:29,800
3.

914
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,030
2

915
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,000
first.

916
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:35,030
Shoot!

917
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,000
Beta Trident, regenerate the activation code.

918
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:40,560
Construction of complete molecular structure decomposition code.

919
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:49,830
Construction of complete atomic structure decomposition code.

920
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,660
Build the activation code to destroy Beta,

921
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,360
finish.

922
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,860
Beta Trident!

923
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:10,960
Fire!

924
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:21,830
Just like you think ...

925
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,430
... Onii-sama!

926
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:07,300
Onii-sama!

927
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:14,700
Mission…

928
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,600
Ah no ...

929
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,600
Finish.

930
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:02,530
Ok.

931
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:03,160
OK.

932
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,630
Be healthy.
