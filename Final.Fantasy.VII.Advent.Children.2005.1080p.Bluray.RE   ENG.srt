1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:05,162
To those who loved this world...

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,170
...and knew friendly company therein:

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:13,278
This Reunion is for you.

4
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:33,951
498 Years Earlier

5
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:39,024
Why did humankind even bothered.

6
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:43,152
You rack everything you've ever made, and start over.

7
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:47,641
Like there'll be any different after that.

8
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:55,471
I supposed we're not good at facing our memories,

9
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:58,779
We'd rather kill the past .

10
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,471
Find something worthwile among the rubble
and build the future with that.

11
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:06,855
And that's the reason why you hide Mother?

12
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:09,033
To kill the past?

13
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,386
We were trying to rid ourselves
of a more immediate problem.

14
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:18,879
You don't mean the stigma?

15
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:22,915
But you're the one who brought
that on yourself in the first place.

16
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:25,948
I see.

17
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:31,004
I guess you really do have a short memory.

18
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:34,735
No, not me.

19
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,145
You see, it is my choice to forget.

20
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:53,022
2 Weeks Ago

21
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:56,372
<i>Tseng! Look at this.</i>

22
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:57,183
<i>Hm?</i>

23
00:03:00,142 --> 00:03:01,734
<i>Found it.</i>

24
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,809
<i>Not a pretty sight, is it?</i>

25
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:07,972
Who cares?
Just get the damn thing.

26
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:09,879
<i>Reno, I'm counting on you.</i>

27
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:12,211
You got it.

28
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:29,756
<i>Whoa!</i>

29
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:31,955
<i>Senpai, hurry!</i>

30
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:35,365
<i>Senpai!</i>

31
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,799
<i>Who the hell is that?</i>

32
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:43,935
<i>Elena!</i>

33
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,276
<i>Go! Get out!</i>

34
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,438
<i>Tseng-san!</i>

35
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:11,954
<i>You are going to give her back eventually.</i>

36
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,886
<i>The Lifestream.</i>

37
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:48,050
<i>That's what we call the river of life
that circles our planet...</i>

38
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:53,199
<i>... giving life to the world
and everything in it.</i>

39
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:57,901
<i>The Shinra Electric Power Company
discovered a way...</i>

40
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:01,939
<i>... to use the Lifestream
as an energy source.</i>

41
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:07,944
<i>Because of Shinra's energy, we were
able to live very comfortable lives.</i>

42
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:12,209
<i>But wasn't that because we were
taking away from the planet's life?</i>

43
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,650
<i>A lot of people thought so.</i>

44
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:23,318
<i>Shinra used their power to try and
stop anybody who got in their way.</i>

45
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:29,694
<i>Shinra had a special group
of warriors called SOLDIER.</i>

46
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:33,598
<i>And all the SOLDIERs
had Jenova cells put inside them.</i>

47
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:37,174
<i>Jenova was a calamity that fell
from the sky a long, long time ago...</i>

48
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:40,676
<i>... and tried to destroy the planet.</i>

49
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:45,116
<i>Anyway, there was one SOLDIER
named Sephiroth...</i>

50
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,447
<i>... who was better than the rest.</i>

51
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:53,251
<i>But when he found out about the
terrible experiments that made him...</i>

52
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,725
<i>... he began to hate Shinra.</i>

53
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,867
<i>And then, over time,
he began to hate everything.</i>

54
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:09,495
<i>Shinra and the people against them.</i>

55
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:11,664
<i>Sephiroth, who hated
the planet so much...</i>

56
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:15,596
<i>... he wanted to make it go away.</i>

57
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:18,600
<i>And the people who tried to stop him.</i>

58
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:22,106
<i>There were a lot of battles.</i>

59
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:27,603
<i>For every battle,
there was more sadness.</i>

60
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:33,446
<i>Someone I love went back
to the Lifestream too.</i>

61
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:37,582
<i>And then, it came.</i>

62
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,520
<i>The chosen day.</i>

63
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:45,358
<i>In the end, the planet itself had to
make the battles stop for good.</i>

64
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:50,366
<i>The planet used the Lifestream
as a weapon...</i>

65
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,733
<i>... and when it burst out
of the earth...</i>

66
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,774
<i>... all the fighting,
all the greed and sadness...</i>

67
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:00,913
<i>... everything was washed away.</i>

68
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,260
<i>"Sadness was the price
to see it end. "</i>

69
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,999
<i>It's been two years
since they told me that.</i>

70
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:02,533
Move it, move it.

71
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:05,764
Whoa.

72
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:12,971
Sis, let's go.

73
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:13,993
Yeah.

74
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:41,413
<i>But it looks like the planet
is a lot angrier than we thought.</i>

75
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:48,906
<i>They call it geostigma.</i>

76
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:56,697
Well, Marlene?
How does it look?

77
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:05,141
Please. Please don't
take Denzel away.

78
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,761
<i>"The commission report release this
morning has reveal"</i>

79
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:20,272
<i>"That lifestream concentration at the atmosphere"</i>

80
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:23,903
<i>"Has been drop to a mere
hundred of a levels 2 years ago."</i>

81
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:26,049
<i>"However, the concentration remains toxic"</i>

82
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:29,315
<i>"Around the Shinra Company main building
as well as the company's mako reactors."
He's not here anymore.</i>

83
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:31,092
<i>"To prevent the onset of Geostigma"</i>

84

<i>"The commission does advice that you
stay away from these facilities"</i>

85
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:37,630
<i>"And the surrounding areas."</i>

<i>"Next up. Should Shinra be held
financial responsible for the crisis?"</i>

87
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:47,953
Cloud, where is he now?

88
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:05,351
Strife Delivery Service.
You name it, we ship...

89
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,351
May I ask who's calling?

90
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:16,927
Yeah, I remember you.

91
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:40,423
<i>You got a call from Reno.
He's in Healin.</i>

92
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:42,527
<i>Says he's got work for you.</i>

93
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,323
<i>Cloud, how have you been?</i>

94
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:46,964
<i>You have no more messages...</i>

95
00:11:57,136 --> 00:12:01,368
Hey, Kadaj?
Is that where Big Brother lives?

96
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:03,272
Yeah.

97
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:06,036
Think he'll be happy to see us?

98
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:08,941
- Not a chance.
- Don't cry, Yazoo.

99
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:12,112
But Mother's with him?

100
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:15,684
Maybe not.

101
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:17,185
Oh, don't cry, Loz.

102
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:25,756
Look, here he comes.

103
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:07,499
Where's Mother?

104
00:13:11,611 --> 00:13:14,102
We know you hid her, Brother.

105
00:13:22,755 --> 00:13:26,020
Don't tell me you're leading me on?

106
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:28,955
Because I think
you do have Mother there.

107
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:31,528
No need to shout.

108
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:35,590
Put the president on.

109
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:38,334
You're starting to bother me.

110
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:04,105
Don't run away.

111
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:09,674
<i>Hey, it's me, Barret!</i>

112
00:15:10,111 --> 00:15:14,083
<i>I did it! A new oil field!
O-IL-FIELD!</i>

113
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,018
<i>A huge one, too!</i>

114
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,841
<i>And we're sticking to plan, so soon
I'll be able to come visit Marlene!</i>

115
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:20,576
<i>Tell her for me!
See ya!</i>

116
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,007
<i>Reno called again.</i>

117
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:31,640
<i>He says to hurry,
but he sounded kind of strange...</i>

118
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:34,276
<i>Be careful, okay?</i>

119
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,805
Okay, so you're good.

120
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:16,052
Yeah, Rude, looking sharp!

121
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:27,423
Just as expected
from an ex-SOLDIER.

122
00:16:35,743 --> 00:16:38,109
You haven't rusted a bit.

123
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:49,851
Is that you, Rufus?
You've got no luck either...

124
00:16:54,662 --> 00:16:56,630
- The day of the explosion...
- What do you want?

125
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,856
...I managed to get out...
- Who were the guys that attacked me?

126
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,556
...before it colla...
- I'm leaving.

127
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:05,764
We need your assistance.

128
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:08,498
- Not interest...
- I acknowledge that Shinra...

129
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,405
...owes the planet a lot.

130
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:14,775
It goes without saying
that my company and I...

131
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:18,042
...are the ones who put
the world in the sorry state it's in.

132
00:17:18,252 --> 00:17:21,881
So we feel we have a responsibility
to set things right.

133
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,215
I'm still out here!

134
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:25,449
We've already taken the first step...

135
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:29,254
...by conducting an investigation
in Sephiroth's wake.

136
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:37,459
It's been 2 years, now that that the
world is on the speed again, what's the threat now?

137
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:44,157
Well, that one's easy, Geostigma.

138
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:49,900
And we have to think Sephiroth is the one responsible.

139
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:59,455
The people blame Mako energy, Mako reactors,
even the Lifestream for causing the stigma

140
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:02,473
However, isn't it wrong
to put a blame on it?

141
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:09,945
The Lifestream existed as long as the Planet and even
Mako evergy has been part of our life for 40 years.

142
00:18:10,234 --> 00:18:15,449
And yet there's no mention about
stigma in recorded history.

143
00:18:15,998 --> 00:18:21,492
So, what happen during our time
to change all that?

144
00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:23,927
I can only think of one thing.

145
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,722
Sephiroth's awaken.

146
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:27,902
Sephiroth is dead.

147
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:29,750
Of course, but what about
his mind?

148
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:37,183
What if somehow he dissolve into the
Lifestream coursing with the Planet undiffuse.

149
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,533
I know, it's merely my speculation.

150
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:45,366
But, there are possibilities right?

151
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:49,926
And we can't cure the
stigma until we know the truth.

152
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:55,577
So we took the first step,
and went to look for traces of Sephiroth.

153
00:18:55,577 --> 00:19:00,560
Do you by any chance,
still remember where is it?

154
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:02,350
<i>At the Northern Cave!</i>

155
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:04,178
What do you think we found?

156
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:10,032
We didn't find anything. You can relax.

157
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:14,737
However, not all went as planned.

158
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:19,675
We were interrupted.
It was the three who attacked you.

159
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:32,590
<i>Tseng-san!</i>

160
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:36,376
Kadaj's gang.

161
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:39,023
Kadaj?

162
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:44,236
Really, what could they be thinking?

163
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:46,000
What does that have to do with me?

164
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:48,346
<i>You are going to give her back eventually.</i>

165
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:53,785
Your ties with Sephiroth run
as deep as our too Cloud.

166
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:59,760
And if Kadaj’s goal is to prepare
for an imminent occasion

167
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,122
We should be prepared
for the upcoming threat.

168
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:04,057
Prepare?

169
00:20:06,302 --> 00:20:07,456
Sephiroth...

170
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:10,784
...resurrection.

171
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:11,900
Are you done talking?

172
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,861
Let's get things clear.

173
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:19,519
In order to battle with Kadaj,
we need someone with your expertise.

174
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,388
Will you join us?

175
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:24,894
SOLDIER member, Cloud.

176
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:27,914
Former.

177
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:35,750
What's this stuff about 'Mother'?

178
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:40,198
Beats me. Didn't Kadaj mention
anything to you?

179
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:41,878
Rufus.

180
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:44,522
Are you hiding something from me?

181
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:49,082
I never keep a secret,
especially from a comrade.

182
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,779
I'm sure you wanted to learn
more about the stigma?

183
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:57,262
Obviously for the sake of
those orphan you live with.

184
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:03,202
Don't you want to see the
smile of the children?

185
00:20:57,598 --> 00:21:03,093
Think about it. Don't you want
to put smiles back on their faces?

186
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:09,402
All we want in the end
is to rebuild our world, Cloud.

187
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:20,450
- But I...
- Come on, Cloud.

188
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:24,250
Together, we can rebuild Shinra!

189
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,987
Not interested.

190
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:29,563
- Reno!
- Reno!

191
00:21:52,286 --> 00:21:54,982
Does Cloud live here?

192
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,384
I guess he does.

193
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,357
What's this?

194
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,422
It's just like Denzel. Is Cloud sick?

195
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:32,849
Why didn't he just say something?

196
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,392
Did he leave because he's sick?

197
00:22:35,596 --> 00:22:38,030
He wants to fight alone.

198
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,166
- Fight?
- No.

199
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,131
I don't think he will.

200
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:47,034
Tifa?

201
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,371
Let's go back, Marlene?

202
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,609
No! I wanna see Cloud!

203
00:23:00,321 --> 00:23:02,152
...I guess you're right.

204
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:07,253
- It'd be nice to see him, huh?
- Yeah.

205
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:10,525
Hey, what should we do when he gets here?

206
00:23:10,731 --> 00:23:12,562
We'll all go home!

207
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:16,362
Before that, we'll lecture him!

208
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:18,300
Agreed!

209
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:23,723
Now we just have to find Tseng and Elena.

210
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:28,554
The other employees give you any leads?

211
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:30,082
Nothing yet.

212
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:39,763
Who have thought, Shinra's employee return to work.

213
00:23:39,854 --> 00:23:44,237
Now that's dedicate.
I'm telling you this going to be a fresh start.

214
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:48,714
Well, those who alive have a lot to atone for.

215
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:55,168
It's been 2 years already, right?

216
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:58,047
It seems a lot longer than that.

217
00:23:59,382 --> 00:24:01,447
What a nightmare huh?

218
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,256
The world was almost done for.

219
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,800
And we're a part of it.

220
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:13,691
Seriously though,
how we're supposed to atone for that?

221
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:18,189
Too bad the directors not around.

222
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:20,933
Elena too.

223
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:26,376
I hope they're still alive.

224
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:28,156
It's alright.

225
00:24:28,156 --> 00:24:32,677
Tseng is just like the President.
They always escape from the death god.

226
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:34,973
I'm sure of that.

227
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,594
You got that right.

228
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:47,087
<i>Found you.</i>

229
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:00,882
Church?

230
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:05,522
Ah, I know that one.

231
00:25:07,146 --> 00:25:08,715
I'll be waiting.

232
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:40,381
<i>Your call to Sector 7 cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

233
00:26:41,697 --> 00:26:45,452
<i>Your call to Sector 7 cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

234
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:50,750
<i>Your call to Sector 7 cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

235
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:56,062
<i>Your call to Sector 7 cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

236
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:01,525
<i>Your call to Sector 7 cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

237
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:39,385
Cloud, you rarely call back
aren't you?

238
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:41,444
Anything happen?

239
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:45,853
Cloud?

240
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,157
No it's not.

241
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:52,398
Who's this?
Isn't this Cloud's phone?

242
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,253
I don't know.

243
00:27:54,578 --> 00:27:56,230
Who are you?

244
00:27:57,491 --> 00:28:03,629
I don't know. Please, I don't know
what to do, I can't do this.

245
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,731
Are you crying?

246
00:28:17,244 --> 00:28:19,393
What happen?
Are you okay?

247
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:22,439
- Cloud! Cloud!
- Where are you?

248
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,078
Oi!

249
00:28:37,254 --> 00:28:38,778
Are you alright?

250
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:23,778
I hate liars.

251
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:27,669
I apologize.
This time you'll get the truth.

252
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:31,638
The object you seek fell from the helicopter
while we were running from you.

253
00:29:31,638 --> 00:29:34,314
What a ridiculous story.

254
00:29:35,182 --> 00:29:36,902
Is that right?

255
00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:39,470
I swear it.

256
00:29:40,939 --> 00:29:43,643
Then swear on these.

257
00:29:50,428 --> 00:29:54,888
- Why are you doing this?
- We need Mother's power.

258
00:29:55,566 --> 00:29:58,626
The Reunion is coming
and we need her.

259
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,962
Reunion?

260
00:30:01,372 --> 00:30:04,739
My brothers and sisters who share
Mother's cells will all assemble.

261
00:30:04,942 --> 00:30:07,877
And together, we'll take revenge
on the planet.

262
00:30:08,078 --> 00:30:12,310
We've already sent out the invitations,
but you know.

263
00:30:12,516 --> 00:30:15,883
Someone's gone and hidden
the guest of honor.

264
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:17,110
Invitations?

265
00:30:17,888 --> 00:30:22,518
The stigma.
But you know all about that.

266
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,497
Mother's memetic legacy lives on in
the Lifestream and makes it happen.

267
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:34,295
She does so much for us, and we
don't even know where to find her.

268
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:41,835
But what can we do, we're just
remnants of Mother's legacy.

269
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:47,245
Until we find Mother and receive
her cells, we can't be whole again.

270
00:30:48,085 --> 00:30:51,020
Geostigma and a legacy
aren't enough.

271
00:30:51,222 --> 00:30:54,191
Not for a true Reunion.

272
00:30:54,425 --> 00:30:55,619
What do you mean?

273
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:02,198
Mr. President, surely you've noticed?

274
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,145
Sorry, sorry.

275
00:31:44,132 --> 00:31:45,139
The stigma!

276
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:52,654
Can't you people just stay indoors?

277
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:08,240
Here.

278
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:41,112
I said I'd live out both our lives.

279
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,254
Easier said than done.

280
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:48,860
You wanna be in SOLDIER?
Hang in there!

281
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:50,253
Hey, how're you doing?

282
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:53,592
What're you gonna do
once we get to Midgar?

283
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:56,616
We're friends, right?

284
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,642
Old man, stop somewhere behind a rock.

285
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:08,476
Cloud, we’re getting off!

286
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,716
My dreams and pride...

287
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:18,160
...You can have them all.

288
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,226
You're...

289
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:24,374
...the proof that I existed.

290
00:33:26,793 --> 00:33:31,016
On that day,
I swore I'll never forget.

291
00:33:31,612 --> 00:33:34,728
But, I...

292
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,625
Don't pretend you're sad.

293
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:49,309
Why tremble with anger that's not even there.

294
00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:54,101
Do you know why, Cloud?

295
00:33:54,102 --> 00:33:58,589
All you are, is an empty puppet.

296
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:27,095
Wanna play?

297
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,596
I guess that's a no.

298
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:36,899
Where's Mother?

299
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:45,741
It stinks.

300
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:51,182
- Hey, where's Mother?
- There's no one here!

301
00:34:52,656 --> 00:34:55,147
Fine. Play with me.

302
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,800
This'll be fun.

303
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,677
Tifa!

304
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,748
She's not here.

305
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:02,211
I'm not crying!

306
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,617
Got it. I'll bring it.

307
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,353
Time to finish this.

308
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,280
Cloud!

309
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:14,837
Run!

310
00:38:33,184 --> 00:38:35,824
About earlier, I'm sorry.

311
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,268
Thank you.

312
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:48,536
My brother...

313
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,031
Isn't around anymore.

314
00:38:54,982 --> 00:38:56,243
I see.

315
00:38:57,434 --> 00:39:00,727
You've got the stigma too?

316
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:03,339
Come on, they're gonna fix us.

317
00:39:56,276 --> 00:39:57,766
Tifa?

318
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:01,312
Tifa!

319
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:09,280
You're late...

320
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:11,320
Who did this?

321
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,420
He didn't say.

322
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:18,389
Marlene?!

323
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,829
No...

324
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,376
You're pretty heavy.

325
00:41:40,814 --> 00:41:44,341
You were living with some kids, right?

326
00:41:44,551 --> 00:41:46,212
They ain't here.

327
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,014
Is that okay with you?

328
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:56,262
I...

329
00:42:07,207 --> 00:42:09,732
You're a real handful.

330
00:42:21,945 --> 00:42:24,398
Tifa said to take you home, kid.

331
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,602
Hold on tight.

332
00:43:03,762 --> 00:43:05,777
Who are these people
that's going to fix us?

333
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:10,332
I don't know.

334
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:17,152
Anyone is fine.

335
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:38,156
So Big Brother was hiding it.

336
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:43,657
This is the power of the Lifestream.

337
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:51,966
This materia will give us
renewed power.

338
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:57,529
So, those were a gift from Mother?

339
00:43:57,529 --> 00:43:59,545
Yea, it should be.

340
00:44:00,403 --> 00:44:02,907
Then, Brother is hiding Mother too?

341
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:06,271
No. It's that President guy.

342
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:10,879
Keeping things hidden is something
Shinra's people are very good at

343
00:44:12,046 --> 00:44:16,307
Then we have to look everywhere
that have to do with Shinra.

344
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:20,735
Pretty soon, we'll have plenty of helps.

345
00:44:21,316 --> 00:44:23,619
This is fun!

346
00:44:25,722 --> 00:44:27,324
But first.

347
00:44:28,135 --> 00:44:30,832
We need to have a talk with Brother.

348
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:34,765
He likes to pretend as if he's
not a part of the family.

349
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:38,473
He makes me sad, really sad.

350
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:47,852
Right?

351
00:45:08,562 --> 00:45:10,689
Reno and Rude are looking.

352
00:45:15,803 --> 00:45:19,899
You have geostigma, don't you.

353
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:24,470
So it's okay to just give up and die.
Is that what you think?

354
00:45:29,149 --> 00:45:30,810
It knew it.

355
00:45:31,552 --> 00:45:33,315
There's no cure.

356
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:36,722
That's not stopping Denzel
from fighting.

357
00:45:37,157 --> 00:45:39,387
Don't run. Let's fight it together.

358
00:45:39,593 --> 00:45:42,619
<i>We can help each other,
I know we can.</i>

359
00:45:45,933 --> 00:45:48,902
Or do we have to be a real family
for that to work?

360
00:45:49,103 --> 00:45:50,764
I...

361
00:45:52,273 --> 00:45:54,969
...am not fit to help anyone.

362
00:45:55,609 --> 00:45:59,101
Not my family, not my friends.

363
00:45:59,313 --> 00:46:00,837
No one.

364
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:05,651
Dilly-dally, shilly-shally...

365
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:13,185
Dilly-dally, shilly-shally...

366
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:16,223
I think she wants you
to move on.

367
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,391
Did you find them?

368
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,965
Only a witness.

369
00:46:21,168 --> 00:46:23,796
Saw them being taken away.

370
00:46:24,004 --> 00:46:27,496
- Where are they?
- The Forgotten City.

371
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:29,970
Their base.

372
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:47,925
I've received a special power from Mother.

373
00:46:48,128 --> 00:46:50,392
The power to fight...

374
00:46:51,332 --> 00:46:53,596
...against a planet
that torments its people.

375
00:46:56,837 --> 00:47:00,603
She gave this power to all her children.

376
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:02,972
That's right.

377
00:47:04,211 --> 00:47:06,645
You and I are brethren.

378
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:09,209
Brothers and sisters chosen...

379
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:13,546
...when we inherited Mother's memetic
legacy through the Lifestream.

380
00:47:15,089 --> 00:47:17,114
But...

381
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:21,350
...the planet doesn't like that.

382
00:47:21,762 --> 00:47:25,198
It's trying to hold us back.

383
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:31,596
That's why it's been racking our bodies
with pain, filling our hearts with doubt!

384
00:47:33,874 --> 00:47:35,933
I will heal you.

385
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:39,408
Then we will go to Mother.

386
00:47:39,613 --> 00:47:44,073
We will join as a family
and strike back at the planet!

387
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:51,313
Do as I do.

388
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:39,002
Denzel.

389
00:48:43,477 --> 00:48:44,739
Denzel!

390
00:48:56,692 --> 00:48:58,321
Mother, look.

391
00:48:59,283 --> 00:49:01,999
All my new siblings.

392
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:08,605
They will keep me company
until I found you.

393
00:49:47,273 --> 00:49:49,332
You came.

394
00:49:51,277 --> 00:49:54,269
Even though you're about to break.

395
00:49:55,548 --> 00:49:57,880
That's a good sign.

396
00:49:59,218 --> 00:50:00,776
I wanna ask something!

397
00:50:01,587 --> 00:50:03,680
Why exactly did you come here for?

398
00:50:05,758 --> 00:50:09,216
I think I want to be forgiven...

399
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,825
Yes, I want to be forgiven.

400
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:16,300
By who?

401
00:51:06,385 --> 00:51:07,909
Glad you could make it.

402
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,109
I'm here for the kids.

403
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:12,916
See this man? He's our big brother.

404
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:14,854
But you know,

405
00:51:16,062 --> 00:51:18,292
It's a shame...

406
00:51:19,632 --> 00:51:21,691
He's a traitor.

407
00:51:25,037 --> 00:51:26,265
Cloud!

408
00:53:45,945 --> 00:53:48,812
I really can't save anyone, right?

409
00:53:49,648 --> 00:53:52,845
Vincent. What do you know
about this?

410
00:53:54,587 --> 00:53:56,487
I come here often.

411
00:53:58,924 --> 00:54:01,392
I've seen what Kadaj's group
is doing.

412
00:54:03,162 --> 00:54:04,823
The stigma.

413
00:54:05,231 --> 00:54:07,893
Inside our bodies, we all have
a current like the Lifestream.

414
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,864
When alien matter infests the body,
this current is what fights it off.

415
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:16,604
There's a flow through the body like the Lifestream...

416
00:54:17,243 --> 00:54:20,144
It fights against the invasion of harmful substances.

417
00:54:22,448 --> 00:54:24,678
Harmful substances...

418
00:54:25,017 --> 00:54:28,714
The Sephiroth gene.
Jenova's memetic legacy.

419
00:54:29,388 --> 00:54:30,377
Call it what you want.

420
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:34,019
You're well-informed.

421
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,760
Tseng and Elena.

422
00:54:36,962 --> 00:54:39,988
They were brought here half-dead.

423
00:54:40,399 --> 00:54:42,833
They must have been
brutally tortured.

424
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:46,367
I did what I could to save them...

425
00:54:47,106 --> 00:54:49,370
...but it was ugly.

426
00:54:49,575 --> 00:54:51,099
Tortured?

427
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,000
They had it coming.

428
00:54:53,212 --> 00:54:55,339
They got their hands
on Jenova's head.

429
00:54:56,181 --> 00:54:59,048
Then the "Mother"
Kadaj is looking for...

430
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:03,745
Heaven's dark harbinger.
The calamity, Jenova.

431
00:55:04,156 --> 00:55:07,421
If they wanted to,
they could make another Sephiroth.

432
00:55:08,861 --> 00:55:10,488
Kadaj...

433
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:12,588
What is he?

434
00:55:13,699 --> 00:55:15,394
I'd rather not know.

435
00:55:26,879 --> 00:55:27,868
Marlene!

436
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,275
Cloud! Denzel and Tifa!

437
00:55:30,482 --> 00:55:31,915
Tifa is all right.

438
00:55:32,117 --> 00:55:34,142
I wanna talk to her!

439
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:40,883
Do you have it?

440
00:55:42,294 --> 00:55:44,262
I can't believe it!

441
00:55:46,398 --> 00:55:49,196
Vincent, will you take Marlene
back to the bar?

442
00:55:49,968 --> 00:55:52,061
I'm gonna go get some answers
from Shinra.

443
00:55:52,271 --> 00:55:54,262
- You know I can't.
- But...

444
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,207
Cloud, that's enough!

445
00:55:56,408 --> 00:55:59,639
Why won't you listen to what we're trying to say?

446
00:56:03,082 --> 00:56:06,347
Marlene, please give me some time.

447
00:56:06,552 --> 00:56:08,850
There's a battle to be fought...

448
00:56:09,054 --> 00:56:11,579
...but it's not as simple
as just fighting it. You understand, right?

449
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,451
No, I don't!

450
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:16,457
Cloud, is this really about the fight?

451
00:56:18,831 --> 00:56:19,855
<i>Where are they?</i>

452
00:56:20,065 --> 00:56:21,999
<i>The Forgotten City.</i>

453
00:56:22,935 --> 00:56:24,425
Ajit.

454
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:29,373
Please take care of it.

455
00:56:35,914 --> 00:56:38,974
- I have to talk to Rufus.
- Stop running!

456
00:56:39,651 --> 00:56:40,811
I know.

457
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:43,510
Even if you find the kids,
you might not be able to help them.

458
00:56:43,722 --> 00:56:46,156
Maybe something will happen
that can never unhappen.

459
00:56:46,358 --> 00:56:47,916
That scares you, doesn't it?

460
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:50,425
But you need to think about now.
Take it in.

461
00:56:50,629 --> 00:56:53,154
You think you've got it hard? Tough.

462
00:56:53,365 --> 00:56:55,833
Sharing your life
with other people is hard.

463
00:56:56,034 --> 00:56:57,524
I know you don't want to be alone.

464
00:56:57,736 --> 00:57:01,103
You might not answer the phone,
but you won't throw it away either.

465
00:57:04,076 --> 00:57:07,409
Why don't you just go to Ajit.

466
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:19,179
Why do we have to lose out
to our memory?

467
00:57:25,597 --> 00:57:29,533
<i>But I let you die.</i>

468
00:57:30,302 --> 00:57:32,896
<i>Really, you're always drifting...</i>

469
00:57:33,105 --> 00:57:36,563
<i>Cloud, why can't you
forgive yourself?</i>

470
00:57:39,511 --> 00:57:42,446
Are sins ever forgiven?

471
00:57:43,148 --> 00:57:44,547
I've never tried.

472
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:46,383
Tried it?

473
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:48,077
Tried it...

474
00:57:53,225 --> 00:57:54,522
Marlene, let's go home.

475
00:57:59,264 --> 00:58:00,561
I'm gonna try.

476
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,100
I'll let you know how it goes.

477
00:58:22,688 --> 00:58:25,088
<i>It's me, Reeve.</i>

478
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:27,121
<i>How's work going?</i>

479
00:58:27,726 --> 00:58:31,093
<i>I saw your flyer. How the hell
do you stay in business?</i>

480
00:58:31,296 --> 00:58:33,264
<i>You never change, Cloud.</i>

481
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:37,257
<i>I was thinking about helping you out,
but I guess I'll call back another time.</i>

482
00:58:37,469 --> 00:58:39,562
<i>- Later.
- Surprise! It's me, Yuffie.</i>

483
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:42,604
<i>So, hey, all the kids
are missing from Wutai.</i>

484
00:58:42,808 --> 00:58:46,835
<i>Have you heard anything?
Give me a ring and fill me in, okay?</i>

485
00:58:51,984 --> 00:58:55,750
<i>I never blamed you, not once.</i>

486
00:58:56,555 --> 00:59:01,254
<i>You came for me.
That's all that matters.</i>

487
00:59:39,998 --> 00:59:43,456
- Hey, are you listening?
- Why the hell are you doing this?

488
01:00:32,502 --> 01:00:34,163
Denzel?

489
01:00:39,142 --> 01:00:41,770
Denzel. Denzel!

490
01:01:02,498 --> 01:01:04,557
And what are we up to?

491
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:15,530
Mother's here, isn't she?

492
01:01:15,898 --> 01:01:17,289
How do you figure?

493
01:01:17,428 --> 01:01:19,657
This, what you call it?

494
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:21,230
Monument.

495
01:01:21,814 --> 01:01:23,512
I bet Shinra made it.

496
01:01:23,512 --> 01:01:26,157
Wow, you used your head, didn't you?

497
01:01:26,918 --> 01:01:28,055
Am I wrong?

498
01:01:28,456 --> 01:01:29,544
Who knows.

499
01:01:29,892 --> 01:01:32,793
We don't know anything about it either.

500
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:38,558
I see, as if anyone would trust you.

501
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:43,699
Rude!

502
01:01:44,522 --> 01:01:46,078
Say something!

503
01:02:05,231 --> 01:02:06,293
Does it hurt?

504
01:02:09,121 --> 01:02:10,201
Yea.

505
01:02:10,201 --> 01:02:13,384
But, not as bad as Denzel's.

506
01:02:14,517 --> 01:02:16,055
Can it be cure?

507
01:02:17,435 --> 01:02:18,795
I don't know.

508
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:25,559
For Denzel's sake, you've been trying
so hard to find a cure for it.

509
01:02:26,244 --> 01:02:28,112
You knew about that?

510
01:02:28,596 --> 01:02:32,274
Cloud, you should clean-up your desk sometimes.

511
01:02:33,726 --> 01:02:34,908
I guess so.

512
01:02:37,013 --> 01:02:44,192
Say Cloud, because you can't fix Denzel's stigma,
is that the reason why you left?

513
01:02:45,044 --> 01:02:48,134
Or is it because you had the stigma too?

514
01:02:49,273 --> 01:02:54,079
I just thought I could take care for myself.

515
01:02:54,459 --> 01:02:57,094
That's what I think.

516
01:02:58,055 --> 01:03:02,743
How can you look after your family if you can't
even take a good care of yourself.

517
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:07,252
Or, at least that is what daddy would say.

518
01:03:07,684 --> 01:03:10,492
Cloud, don't give up.

519
01:03:14,244 --> 01:03:19,124
You, and Denzel, and Tifa always
be there to help me.

520
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,101
You're always there whenever I needed you.

521
01:03:24,431 --> 01:03:28,312
For now, it's my turn.

522
01:03:28,313 --> 01:03:29,359
Sure.

523
01:03:38,911 --> 01:03:42,771
Say, Kadaj.
I've got a question for you.

524
01:03:43,956 --> 01:03:46,083
Just one question then.

525
01:03:46,632 --> 01:03:52,075
You said you needed Jenova cells
in order to return to what you were.

526
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:54,160
What does that mean?

527
01:03:55,454 --> 01:03:59,798
He's coming back.

528
01:04:02,331 --> 01:04:04,158
Sephiroth.

529
01:04:04,483 --> 01:04:05,915
The nightmare.

530
01:04:05,915 --> 01:04:07,161
So they say.

531
01:04:07,161 --> 01:04:08,607
You mean...

532
01:04:08,722 --> 01:04:11,369
I don't know Sephiroth.

533
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:15,145
But I know he's close.

534
01:04:16,502 --> 01:04:18,133
It gets under my skin.

535
01:04:18,133 --> 01:04:22,237
What if Mother loves him
more than..?

536
01:04:22,366 --> 01:04:24,485
Poor little remnants.

537
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:28,819
It doesn't matter.
You'll meet the same fate either way!

538
01:04:28,819 --> 01:04:32,731
Mother came to this planet
after a long journey.

539
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:36,284
To rid the cosmos of fools like you.

540
01:04:37,111 --> 01:04:40,420
But you know about it as well.

541
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:46,525
Nothing's changed
since Mother came here.

542
01:04:46,525 --> 01:04:49,556
I have to change it.
To make her happy.

543
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:55,345
There's nothing I wouldn't do,
if she only asked.

544
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,383
Hmph, the nightmare comes again, huh?

545
01:04:58,412 --> 01:05:04,351
As long as you exist, the nightmares
will come again and again.

546
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:09,252
The Lifestream
courses through our planet...

547
01:05:09,892 --> 01:05:13,525
... back and forth across
the borders of life and death.

548
01:05:13,525 --> 01:05:16,789
If that cycle is the very truth of life...

549
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:20,628
... then history, too,
will inevitably repeat itself.

550
01:05:20,628 --> 01:05:23,461
So go on, bring your Jenovas
and your Sephiroths.

551
01:05:23,671 --> 01:05:26,995
It won't matter.

552
01:05:26,995 --> 01:05:30,143
We'll do as life dictates...

553
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:35,174
... and stop you every single time.

554
01:05:36,451 --> 01:05:42,019
Mr. President, is that an excuse
for taking Mother?

555
01:05:42,019 --> 01:05:44,835
Don't tell me
you're feeling remorse?

556
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:46,383
Remorse?

557
01:05:47,061 --> 01:05:50,622
Why, I've never had this much fun.

558
01:05:56,632 --> 01:05:57,983
Glad to hear that.

559
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,983
Now let's put
an end to all this.

560
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:09,612
Denzel, we've got to get away!

561
01:07:58,132 --> 01:07:59,326
This is...

562
01:08:31,532 --> 01:08:33,022
Is it coming after us?

563
01:08:33,233 --> 01:08:34,598
Why don't you go ask it?

564
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:14,771
Having fun yet?

565
01:09:14,975 --> 01:09:17,068
Not at all!

566
01:09:23,183 --> 01:09:25,242
Can't you guys just call it a day?!

567
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:28,648
We will.

568
01:09:28,856 --> 01:09:31,984
If you give back Mother,
that'll be the end of everything.

569
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,692
Damned punks...

570
01:09:40,901 --> 01:09:43,995
...what do you need
Jenova's head for?

571
01:09:55,415 --> 01:09:58,441
Forget your little Reunion
and get a grip!

572
01:09:59,453 --> 01:10:02,081
All we want is to be with Mother!

573
01:10:06,526 --> 01:10:11,327
Mother will know what's best.
She'll tell us what to do.

574
01:10:12,099 --> 01:10:14,567
Now, where is she?

575
01:10:29,149 --> 01:10:32,846
Mother, mother.
It's Jenova's frigging head!

576
01:10:33,053 --> 01:10:35,886
- Hey!
- Don't talk about Mother like that.

577
01:10:36,089 --> 01:10:37,351
Unforgiven!

578
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,123
We're sorry...

579
01:10:42,796 --> 01:10:44,423
That's right...

580
01:10:44,631 --> 01:10:46,531
Wait, why are we apologizing?

581
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,247
Tifa?

582
01:11:42,189 --> 01:11:44,054
Bastard!

583
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:58,969
You look after Mom.

584
01:11:59,172 --> 01:12:00,230
Barret!

585
01:12:01,475 --> 01:12:03,409
Marlene's safe, right? Huh?

586
01:12:18,025 --> 01:12:20,516
I can't match this!

587
01:12:52,726 --> 01:12:54,626
Who's using my materia?!

588
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:56,295
The bad guys, naturally.

589
01:12:56,496 --> 01:12:58,521
Dammit!

590
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:00,195
Who's that?

591
01:13:05,129 --> 01:13:07,983
The latest model, Sierra!

592
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,292
I'll let you ride it later!

593
01:13:12,369 --> 01:13:14,030
Where's the phone shop?

594
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,766
Who's that person?

595
01:13:17,975 --> 01:13:19,306
These are our friends.

596
01:13:22,508 --> 01:13:24,759
Denzel, can you make it to the bar?

597
01:13:52,823 --> 01:13:53,453
Enough!

598
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:57,924
Tifa!

599
01:14:03,575 --> 01:14:04,299
Denzel!

600
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,224
Cloud!

601
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:40,634
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

602
01:14:41,924 --> 01:14:43,173
It's alright.

603
01:14:49,993 --> 01:14:51,227
Are you alright?

604
01:14:54,339 --> 01:14:56,773
Marlene's safe. I took her home.

605
01:14:59,478 --> 01:15:01,708
It feels a little lighter.

606
01:15:05,184 --> 01:15:09,587
Maybe I wore it down by dragging it along so much.

607
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:18,092
I'm going back to the bar.
I'll be waiting with Marlene.

608
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:24,067
You're gonna come home,
right, Cloud?

609
01:16:04,771 --> 01:16:06,419
I can do this!

610
01:18:08,255 --> 01:18:10,553
You're late dammit!

611
01:19:14,788 --> 01:19:19,418
Isn't this fun Boss?
What should we summon next?

612
01:19:28,501 --> 01:19:31,766
- Mother?
- A good son would have known.

613
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:47,443
Go, Cloud!

614
01:20:06,206 --> 01:20:08,037
Haiya!

615
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:23,747
Fly!

616
01:20:32,565 --> 01:20:34,055
It's not over yet!

617
01:21:12,005 --> 01:21:13,472
Here!

618
01:22:04,858 --> 01:22:05,950
Mother!

619
01:22:13,833 --> 01:22:15,130
- Boss!
- Boss!

620
01:22:58,770 --> 01:22:59,919
Boss!

621
01:24:38,683 --> 01:24:41,090
You mess up with the wrong guy.

622
01:25:33,406 --> 01:25:34,451
Rude!

623
01:25:47,164 --> 01:25:49,441
This is bad! This is bad!
This is bad yo!

624
01:25:51,137 --> 01:25:54,305
Ooh, Rude.
You're alright.

625
01:25:54,515 --> 01:25:55,480
Yea.

626
01:25:55,718 --> 01:25:57,397
I'm just peachy.

627
01:26:28,014 --> 01:26:29,703
Senpai!

628
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:25,698
Hey, partner.

629
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:30,235
This thing got any bite?

630
01:28:31,305 --> 01:28:33,773
Shinra technology at its finest.

631
01:28:33,974 --> 01:28:35,874
Oh, so you made this.

632
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:39,138
I don't know about the power, but it sure is flashy.

633
01:28:39,346 --> 01:28:41,109
Oh-hoh!

634
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:44,178
You like that, don't you, partner?

635
01:28:44,651 --> 01:28:47,119
No overtime tonight, eh?

636
01:30:01,395 --> 01:30:03,090
Mother!

637
01:30:16,009 --> 01:30:17,636
Mother...

638
01:30:18,879 --> 01:30:21,006
Mother!

639
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:07,349
<i>Let's go, Cloud.</i>

640
01:32:36,416 --> 01:32:39,442
I've finally found Mother.

641
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,351
So, what happens now?

642
01:32:44,891 --> 01:32:47,883
Mother will tell me, you'll see.

643
01:32:48,862 --> 01:32:52,229
I guess a remnanets won't know anything.

644
01:32:54,635 --> 01:32:57,763
So what if I'm a puppet.

645
01:33:03,143 --> 01:33:07,580
You used to be no different!

646
01:33:33,674 --> 01:33:36,700
Cloud, I brought you materia!

647
01:33:37,744 --> 01:33:40,440
- Don't shake it!
- Yo, Cid! Land this junk heap.

648
01:33:40,647 --> 01:33:43,081
Shut up! You want off, you jump!

649
01:33:43,717 --> 01:33:45,241
Let them fight by themselves.

650
01:33:47,888 --> 01:33:50,618
Kadaj is an avatar of Sephiroth.

651
01:33:51,091 --> 01:33:52,718
Think of him as
a sort of larval form.

652
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,594
Larva? You mean
he's some kinda insect?

653
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:57,263
Calm down, Princess!

654
01:33:57,464 --> 01:33:59,694
So that punk's gonna
become Sephiroth?

655
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:03,734
Wait, Cloud, does he know that?

656
01:34:04,905 --> 01:34:06,031
Probably.

657
01:34:06,606 --> 01:34:08,335
I see.

658
01:34:09,409 --> 01:34:10,671
Let's leave them alone.

659
01:34:10,877 --> 01:34:13,812
I don't get it!
Someone explain it to me!

660
01:34:14,014 --> 01:34:15,276
This is man talk.

661
01:34:15,482 --> 01:34:17,245
Sexist. Sexist!

662
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:19,612
Will you calm down, Princess!?

663
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:21,481
Some of the men
ain't following either.

664
01:34:21,688 --> 01:34:25,624
Two years ago...
During our last battle

665
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:29,057
...do you remember
what it was like to be strong?

666
01:34:29,262 --> 01:34:31,093
It's only been two years...

667
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:33,994
...but somehow that strength
has slipped away.

668
01:34:34,201 --> 01:34:37,034
I think Cloud's found it
again though.

669
01:34:38,505 --> 01:34:39,699
I'll give him 10 minutes.

670
01:34:39,906 --> 01:34:43,205
Always a pain in the ass, that Cloud.

671
01:34:44,444 --> 01:34:46,105
At least he's honest.

672
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:06,120
I'll show you my Reunion.

673
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:30,113
It's been a while, Cloud.

674
01:36:45,265 --> 01:36:47,199
Your stigma is gone?

675
01:36:49,169 --> 01:36:50,693
How unfortunate.

676
01:36:51,037 --> 01:36:53,801
Just what do you really want?

677
01:36:54,007 --> 01:36:57,408
The ghosts of geostigma victims.

678
01:36:57,611 --> 01:37:01,206
They will rejoin the Lifestream
and circle the planet...

679
01:37:01,414 --> 01:37:04,906
Eventually it infringes on the planet...

680
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:07,780
What I really want, Cloud...

681
01:37:08,388 --> 01:37:12,848
...is to sail the darkness of the cosmos
with this planet as my vessel...

682
01:37:13,994 --> 01:37:17,395
...just as my mother did long ago.

683
01:37:24,004 --> 01:37:27,201
Then one day we'll find
a new planet...

684
01:37:27,407 --> 01:37:30,399
...and on its soil we'll create
a shining future.

685
01:37:30,610 --> 01:37:32,441
What will happen to this planet?

686
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:36,776
Well, that's up to you to decide.

687
01:37:58,171 --> 01:37:59,365
Sister?

688
01:38:46,052 --> 01:38:48,179
Where did you find this strength?

689
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:50,785
I don't feel like telling you.

690
01:39:25,792 --> 01:39:28,556
I've thought of
a wonderful present for you.

691
01:39:35,335 --> 01:39:37,303
Shall I give you despair?

692
01:39:47,681 --> 01:39:51,583
Kneel. Beg for forgiveness.

693
01:41:42,586 --> 01:41:46,990
Is this the pain you felt before, Cloud?

694
01:41:47,958 --> 01:41:49,924
Let me remind you again,

695
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,229
And this time, engraved into your memory.

696
01:42:19,451 --> 01:42:22,041
What do you treasure most?

697
01:42:23,753 --> 01:42:26,598
I want the joy of taking it from you.

698
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:35,722
So, what if they look hopeless?

699
01:42:35,963 --> 01:42:38,433
If it were me, I still
wouldn't give up.

700
01:42:42,071 --> 01:42:43,779
Embrace your dreams.

701
01:42:44,184 --> 01:42:48,231
Also, whatever happen protect your
honor as a SOLDIER.

702
01:42:48,864 --> 01:42:51,454
You never made as a SOLDIER.

703
01:42:51,454 --> 01:42:53,917
But it's the feeling that count, the feeling.

704
01:42:54,948 --> 01:42:56,319
Zacks.

705
01:42:57,507 --> 01:43:00,443
Well, do you need a help there?

706
01:43:07,676 --> 01:43:11,548
You already beat him once didn't you?
This should be an easy one, right?

707
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:13,184
Yea.

708
01:43:15,742 --> 01:43:19,499
Never forget.

709
01:43:19,782 --> 01:43:20,914
I am...

710
01:43:22,317 --> 01:43:24,709
...the proof that you existed.

711
01:43:32,426 --> 01:43:36,692
How sad.
You who understand nothing.

712
01:43:37,757 --> 01:43:39,724
There is nothing I don't treasure!

713
01:44:16,283 --> 01:44:20,276
Stay in my memories
where you belong.

714
01:44:25,993 --> 01:44:31,556
I will never be a memory.

715
01:45:01,362 --> 01:45:03,262
Brother...

716
01:45:05,165 --> 01:45:07,133
<i>Kadaj?</i>

717
01:45:20,948 --> 01:45:25,078
<i>You can let it go now, if you want.</i>

718
01:45:29,757 --> 01:45:32,555
Mother, is that you?

719
01:45:33,627 --> 01:45:37,461
<i>Everyone's waiting,
if you're ready to go.</i>

720
01:47:01,815 --> 01:47:03,612
He did it!
That's how it goes!

721
01:47:03,817 --> 01:47:06,786
A man!
Cloud-san's a man!

722
01:47:06,987 --> 01:47:09,114
See? Just like I told you.
He can do anything if he puts his mind to it.

723
01:47:09,323 --> 01:47:11,314
Hold on tight, you guys!

724
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:24,569
You were always with us, weren't you?

725
01:47:25,272 --> 01:47:27,069
Thank you.

726
01:48:07,881 --> 01:48:11,612
Let's all go home together.

727
01:48:15,923 --> 01:48:19,086
And play with everyone...

728
01:48:45,085 --> 01:48:46,712
Cloud!

729
01:48:52,559 --> 01:48:55,687
Cloud said he'd come home.

730
01:49:18,478 --> 01:49:19,422
Let's go.

731
01:50:44,494 --> 01:50:46,359
Mom?

732
01:50:47,630 --> 01:50:52,624
<i>Why does everyone
keep calling me that?</i>

733
01:50:54,637 --> 01:50:57,367
<i>I guess they must be fond of you.</i>

734
01:50:58,274 --> 01:51:01,573
<i>I think this one's outgrown me.</i>

735
01:51:02,378 --> 01:51:07,475
<i>Tough luck, friend.
Looks like your place isn't here.</i>

736
01:52:04,874 --> 01:52:08,935
She said to wait here for Cloud.

737
01:52:11,014 --> 01:52:13,141
Welcome home.

738
01:52:23,159 --> 01:52:25,184
Im home.

739
01:52:28,097 --> 01:52:30,861
There are still children
with the stigma.

740
01:52:39,776 --> 01:52:43,507
Okay, it's time to get fixed up.

741
01:52:45,848 --> 01:52:47,839
It's okay.

742
01:52:49,385 --> 01:52:51,250
Be strong.

743
01:53:43,573 --> 01:53:47,168
- Last one in is a rotten egg!
- It worked, it worked!

744
01:54:34,857 --> 01:54:39,419
You're all right now, aren't you?

745
01:55:02,952 --> 01:55:07,980
Yeah.
I'm not alone.

746
02:00:45,949 --> 02:00:48,311
<i>And all my hopes and dreams</i>

747
02:00:48,312 --> 02:00:51,179
<i>Aren't for anyone</i>

748
02:00:51,180 --> 02:00:55,057
<i>I keep them safe and sound</i>

749
02:00:57,104 --> 02:00:59,984
<i>And hope this picture is</i>

750
02:00:59,985 --> 02:01:03,280
<i>Not yours anymore</i>

751
02:01:03,281 --> 02:01:06,799
<i>But can you hear me now?</i>

752
02:01:09,018 --> 02:01:11,659
<i>Now that’s okay man</i>

753
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:14,695
<i>I’ll say it across this land, </i>

754
02:01:14,696 --> 02:01:18,333
<i>You should’ve kissed me baby</i>

755
02:01:20,575 --> 02:01:23,313
<i>So try and stop me</i>

756
02:01:23,314 --> 02:01:26,398
<i>Or so forgive this light</i>

757
02:01:26,399 --> 02:01:29,966
<i>Cuz I can’t beg all night</i>

758
02:01:30,028 --> 02:01:34,506
<i>Until my heart stops beating</i>

759
02:01:34,507 --> 02:01:37,671
<i>You’ll never hear me say</i>

760
02:01:37,672 --> 02:01:40,532
<i>I won’t kiss you</i>

761
02:01:41,357 --> 02:01:42,903
<i>If I say,</i>

762
02:01:42,904 --> 02:01:46,038
<i>Its lost its beating</i>

763
02:01:46,039 --> 02:01:49,432
<i>If I can’t find my way</i>

764
02:01:49,433 --> 02:01:52,015
<i>It’s over now</i>

765
02:01:53,343 --> 02:01:55,265
<i>That I won’t</i>

766
02:01:55,266 --> 02:01:59,114
<i>Break away</i>

767
02:01:59,114 --> 02:02:03,839
<i>Until the day
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

768
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:09,996
<i>I’m never backing down
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

769
02:02:09,997 --> 02:02:15,102
<i>And hear me say
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

770
02:02:15,103 --> 02:02:21,234
<i>I’ll keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

771
02:02:21,235 --> 02:02:23,922
<i>I’ll keep it safe and…</i>

772
02:02:23,922 --> 02:02:26,381
<i>This hopeless feeling</i>

773
02:02:26,382 --> 02:02:29,378
<i>This fear of falling down</i>

774
02:02:29,379 --> 02:02:33,443
<i>But I’m not crashing now</i>

775
02:02:35,489 --> 02:02:38,314
<i>For all this bleeding</i>

776
02:02:38,315 --> 02:02:41,357
<i>It wasn’t worth the sound</i>

777
02:02:41,358 --> 02:02:45,200
<i>A million screaming out loud</i>

778
02:02:45,201 --> 02:02:46,877
<i>And still </i>

779
02:02:46,878 --> 02:02:49,545
<i>The earth comes reeling</i>

780
02:02:49,546 --> 02:02:52,518
<i>The curtain calls my name</i>

781
02:02:52,519 --> 02:02:56,117
<i>I’m not afraid</i>

782
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:58,445
<i>And I know</i>

783
02:02:58,446 --> 02:03:00,938
<i>You may not miss me</i>

784
02:03:00,939 --> 02:03:03,967
<i>But I am not ashamed</i>

785
02:03:03,968 --> 02:03:08,037
<i>The choice I made</i>

786
02:03:08,038 --> 02:03:09,911
<i>But I can</i>

787
02:03:09,912 --> 02:03:13,666
<i>Let this go</i>

788
02:03:13,667 --> 02:03:18,883
<i>Until the day
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

789
02:03:18,884 --> 02:03:24,956
<i>I’m never backing down
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

790
02:03:24,957 --> 02:03:30,262
<i>Just hear me say
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

791
02:03:30,263 --> 02:03:36,067
<i>I’ll keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

792
02:03:36,068 --> 02:03:37,141
<i>I’ll keep it safe and…</i>

793
02:03:37,142 --> 02:03:40,177
<i>No dashing car</i>

794
02:03:40,178 --> 02:03:42,958
<i>Or a dying star</i>

795
02:03:42,959 --> 02:03:47,189
<i>That’s raced into the ground</i>

796
02:03:48,263 --> 02:03:51,065
<i>Like the final words</i>

797
02:03:51,066 --> 02:03:54,210
<i>Of the passengers</i>

798
02:03:54,211 --> 02:03:58,690
<i>Will the angels give it all?</i>

799
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:01,234
<i>Will the world</i>

800
02:04:01,235 --> 02:04:05,614
<i>Watch us burn?</i>

801
02:04:05,615 --> 02:04:09,971
<i>Until the day
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

802
02:04:09,972 --> 02:04:15,811
<i>I’m never backing down
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

803
02:04:15,812 --> 02:04:21,426
<i>Just hear me say
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

804
02:04:21,427 --> 02:04:27,276
<i>I’ll keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

805
02:04:27,277 --> 02:04:32,778
<i>Keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

806
02:04:32,959 --> 02:04:38,460
<i>Keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

807
02:04:38,855 --> 02:04:44,356
<i>Keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>

808
02:04:44,504 --> 02:04:50,005
<i>Keep it safe and sound
(Whoa, whoa)</i>
