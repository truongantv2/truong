1
-00:00:15,300 --> -00:00:15,267


2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,460
A man dreamt

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,360
Of the world's salvation

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,680
Another man chose

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,820
The survival of his species

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,140
And I wished for

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,580
A single person's happiness

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,720
Beast's Lair & Astro Subs

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,720
Oath Under the Snow

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,520
The Sakatsuki family?

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,240
Yes.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,620
It's a family with an old history

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,580
tracing back to the roots of Fuyuki.

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,600
There's nothing special to mention about them, except for their long history...

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,450
But there's something strange.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,520
Strange?

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:57,600
No one ever witnesses the birth of children in that household.

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,540
What does that mean?

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,800
After age 6, they'll suddenly appear, out of nowhere in this world.

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,950
Recovered from diseases, adopted from another family, children of relatives.

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,450
This is the remnant of the "Child Religion".

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,850
"Child Religion"...?

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,700
Divinity until age 6.

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,700
Children of age 6 and below are closer to God or spirits than any human.

25
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,700
It's that kind of religion.

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,000
In that case, if those children are close to God and spirits, then your wish...

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,050
The possibility isn't high that this Child of God in hiding might be the power we need.

28
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,050
Still...

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,300
If the possibility does exist...

30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,800
Then it's worth a try from us, Heroes of Justice!

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
How many times do I have to tell you?

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,650
I'm not a Hero of Justice or anything like that.

33
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,650
Yeah, yeah...

34
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,650
You're humble, I know.

35
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,160
What is the matter?

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,160
This... is...

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,460
What is that...?

38
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,100
What is happening...?

39
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,800
This phenomenon is far beyond humans...!

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,230
This is bad Kiritsugu!

41
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,100
That black thing... is expanding!

42
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,360
Get in the car, Shirou.

43
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,540
We're leaving.

44
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,100
What are you talking about, Kiritsugu?

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,630
At this rate, the city...

46
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,500
It's okay as long as it stays in the city...!

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,900
We don't know how much further it'll expand...!

48
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,190
It might even reach all the way here...

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,830
No, in the worst case scenario, it'll engulf the entire country...!

50
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,600
But that's why we-

51
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,300
We can't go further by car...

52
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,300
Kiritsugu, I'm going!

53
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,300
Wait, Shirou!

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,900
Shirou!

55
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,130
You are...?

56
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,460
Watch out!

57
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,030
Don't collapse yet...!!!

58
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,160
What was that!?

59
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,830
Can't breath...

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,900
Was that her doing?

61
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,380
This is the first hug... since Mother...

62
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,200
Sakatsuki Miyu.

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,830
The hidden descendant of the Child of God of The Sakatsuki family.

64
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:06,460
It looks like they set up a Bounded Field inside the house. Her birth and upbringing must've been inside.

65
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,460
Then what exactly is the Child of God?

66
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,030
Why did they lock such a small girl inside?

67
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,160
Shirou...

68
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,730
Looks like, we may have finally found it.

69
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,430
Huh?

70
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,300
The Sakatsuki Child of God... their characteristics...

71
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,300
is the power to grant human wishes unconditionally.

72
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,200
Their magus set up a Bounded Field to block outside human thought.

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,000
For six years, The Sakatsuki kept the children apart from other humans and relied only on their mothers...

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,830
just to return their Child of God into a regular human child.

75
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,530
But something unexpected happened.

76
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,460
Their magus disappeared after that black shadow arrived and the Bounded Field collapsed as a result.

77
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,220
Suddenly, Humanity's cries reached Miyu.

78
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,300
Humanity's cries?

79
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,100
The journey has ended, Shirou.

80
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,980
I will use this child.

81
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,450
And in this land of Fuyuki,

82
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,800
Humanity will be saved.

83
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,530
Um, Miyu is your name, right?

84
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,800
I'm Emiya Shirou. Pleased to meet you.

85
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,260
Emiya... Shirou...

86
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,800
Right, that's my name.

87
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,760
Emiya Shirou...

88
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,260
Just Shirou is fine.

89
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,460
Shirou...

90
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:41,460
Right. Since we'll be living together now, we're... like a family.

91
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,930
Like a family...

92
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,460
Yeah.

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,600
And that other person is Emiya Kiritsugu.

94
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,900
He's my adoptive father, mentor and a Hero of Justice.

95
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,620
Adoptive father... a Hero of Justice...?

96
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,900
Yeah. I lost my parents due to an accident when I was little.

97
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,730
And Kiritsugu saved me back then.

98
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,430
You see, Kiritsugu is a weird person.

99
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:24,330
He has an ideal to bring eternal peace to this pain and suffering-filled world.

100
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,760
So, my adoptive father is a Hero of Justice.

101
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,660
Ah, I guess what I'm saying doesn't make sense to you.

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,800
Oh, it's about time I made the food.

103
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,460
Is there something you want to eat in particular?

104
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,500
Not really.

105
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,700
Then, is there something you hate?

106
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,600
No.

107
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,760
Okay. Then please sit tight and wait for me.

108
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,350
Wanna try it?

109
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,100
Kirtsugu, dinner's ready.

110
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,540
...yeah.

111
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,330
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

112
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,330
Just one more step.

113
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,000
Still...

114
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,380
We have the wish-granting device to save humanity

115
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,130
But I have no idea how to use it.

116
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,930
Um... Kiritsuigu?

117
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,400
Miyu's sixth birthday is tomorrow, right?

118
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,860
Yes, that's right.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,830
So, will we have a celebration or...?

120
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,360
What are you talking about?

121
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,700
Like I said, it can be a simple birthday celebration...

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,860
Kiritsugu?

123
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,230
Celebrate?

124
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,070
Celebrate that the Child of God is becoming more human?

125
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,400
We have no idea how long the Child can retain its wish-granting powers.

126
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,660
Is it based on Fuyuki's leylines?

127
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
Is it based on her age?

128
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:01,660
Who knows, she may even lose her powers the moment she turns six years old.

129
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,650
We do have have an obligation to take care of that "thing".

130
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,300
Up to the point of providing her clothes and food is fine, as long as it doesn't cause any changes to it.

131
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,200
But don't misunderstand.

132
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,920
That "thing" is no more than the means to save everything.

133
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,000
I know it. I know he is correct.

134
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,100
Miyu is just a tool to save humanity.

135
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,400
Don't see her as a human...!!

136
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,130
Don't develop feelings for her..!!

137
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,160
Shirou.

138
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,100
Let's play.

139
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,460
Kiritsugu!?

140
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,660
I don't have long.

141
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,860
If that's the case...

142
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,330
Yes. I know my duty.

143
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:08,830
Not long after that, Kiritsugu passed away peacefully in his sleep.

144
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,440
- Five Years Later -

145
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,960
I finished the repairs, Student Council President.

146
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,140
I see. Thanks for the hard work.

147
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,300
Alright, shall we have lunch, Julian?

148
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,410
Emiya Shirou, why are you having your lunch here?

149
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,890
Let's see...

150
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,230
I guess this is the only place to make tea?

151
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,960
If you weren't here, then this would be my personal place.

152
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,010
Come on, don't say that.

153
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,010
Is that all you're having for lunch?

154
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,670
Didn't I tell you that I'd cook your portion too?

155
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,670
Don't say such disgusting things.

156
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,450
Well, isn't it nice to have a chat or two during lunch?

157
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,580
In the first place, there aren't many students in this school.

158
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,320
This isn't the only place where there are few people.

159
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,330
...Yeah.

160
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:12,300
Ever since the Great Fire five years ago, there just aren't many people left.

161
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,210
According to the media, it was caused by a gas explosion...

162
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,560
But the people of Fuyuki know that that's a lie.

163
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,430
You... Did you witness the fire yourself?

164
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,740
Yeah. It was that pitch black thing that swallowed the city.

165
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,380
What about the moment... that shadow disappeared?

166
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,580
No. I was running for my life, so I didn't see it.

167
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,230
...Is that so.

168
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,600
Hey, you were here, Sakura?

169
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,100
Yup. For a while now.

170
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,420
You should've said something, then.

171
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,560
I didn't want to interrupt you.

172
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,020
You don't need to be that formal.

173
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,780
There's no one here beside us anyway.

174
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,360
I wasn't really being formal.

175
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,120
Hm?

176
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,960
Senpai is just so addictive to watch.

177
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,640
Addictive...?

178
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,780
I love... watching Senpai shoot.

179
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,780
Synchronized with no wasted movement. It's like Senpai is the bow itself.

180
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,350
Just like a bow... huh?

181
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,760
Welcome home, Shirou-san.

182
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
I'm back, Miyu.

183
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,360
I made potato stew for dinner.

184
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,760
I cut the ingredients into small portions to fit inside of tomorrow's lunch box.

185
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,980
I also- oh.

186
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,160
Is something the matter?

187
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,740
No. I just thought of how much you've grown.

188
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,810
If that's the case, I think Shirou-san grew more than me.

189
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,580
Haha. You may be right.

190
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,850
How is it?

191
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,350
It's delicious.

192
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,340
You've improved once again.

193
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,650
Thank goodness.

194
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,810
Oh, that's right, Miyu.

195
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,810
What is is, Shirou-san.

196
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,100
I bought a new book for you. I'll give it to you later.

197
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,010
Really? Thank you.

198
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:46,180
Before this you were always reading children's encyclopedia, and now you're even reading professional texts...

199
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,740
Is that... bad?

200
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,470
Its not that it's bad, It's proof that you're learning.

201
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,450
I also won't get funny looks when I borrow the books..

202
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,800
Funny looks?

203
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,270
I can't reveal that I have a little sis, right?

204
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,580
Little sis...

205
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,780
Something wrong?

206
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,580
Huh? I-it's nothing, Shirou-san.

207
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,300
Book title: Picture series - Anatomy Biology

208
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,980
Hey... is that book really alright?

209
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,610
Huh? Aren't all books just like this?

210
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,470
No, I was wondering whether that book is interesting at all or not...

211
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,520
It's for the sake of acquiring knowledge.

212
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,670
Oh... right. I'm going to train for a bit.

213
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,070
Okay, happy training!

214
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,430
I continued to make the same mistakes in my path for Justice.

215
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,540
I always tried to fix what I did wrong, but I only made things worse.

216
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,740
Endlessly repeating... until I couldn't bear it anymore.

217
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,140
I wanted an easy way out, for a miracle to happen.

218
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:08,560
It was like chasing after the clouded moon, a journey in a pitch black night.

219
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,430
You're talking like an old geezer right now, Kiritsugu.

220
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,020
Shirou?

221
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,320
Chasing after what's right could never be a mistake.

222
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,470
I will never let it be a mistake!

223
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,780
Yeah, you do that. I can rest easy now

224
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,940
I... don't know what I should do.

225
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,100
Damn it!

226
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,030
I wonder if mom will like it.

227
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,560
Yeah, she'll love it!

228
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,920
Thanks for the food.

229
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,010
Miyu.

230
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,760
Yes?

231
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,100
Here, take this.

232
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,410
This is...

233
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,230
It's a pajama for you.

234
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,010
You've grown out of your old clothes, right?

235
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,030
Is it really okay?

236
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,410
Yeah, it's really noth-

237
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,740
Thank you, Shirou-san.

238
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,610
I'm... really happy.

239
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,670
Trace... on.

240
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,900
Hey, Kiritsugu. The price for fulfilling the wish is...

241
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,230
It's as you've read

242
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,760
To fulfill the wish, Miyu's life would be bound to the world...?

243
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,490
To save the world, nothing short of a miracle is required.

244
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,410
A wish of this scale would have a price to pay.

245
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,200
A wish of this scale would have a price to pay.

246
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,170
Don't mistake your goal, Shirou.

247
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:27,320
It's saving the greater number of lives, not the few lives in front of your eyes.

248
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,740
Kiritsugu never hesitated.

249
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,100
And yet... why am I...?

250
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,520
Thanks for the hard work, Shirou-san.

251
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,460
You're still up?

252
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,780
Yup. I'm looking for constellation signs.

253
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,110
Constellations? I didn't know you were into something this delicate and romantic.

254
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,670
The movement of constellations and stars should not have any meaning beyond Physics.

255
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:01,720
That's why I would like to know the reason why books like these use pictures and illustrations to give special meanings to the arrangement of stars.

256
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,870
Did I let you read too many picture books...?

257
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,630
Hm?

258
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,360
Pops loved to look at the stars in this spot too.

259
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,830
Fath... Kiritsugu-san? Why?

260
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,140
I wonder why?

261
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,940
At the time, what did Kiritsugu feel when he was watching the stars?

262
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,410
Miyu's Divine power haven't surfaced in years.

263
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,450
She could have... lost all of her power by now.

264
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,050
Then... if that's the case.

265
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,210
...I wish upon the stars

266
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,740
If I could...

267
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,100
If I could fulfill just one wish...

268
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,670
I want Shirou-san and I to be true brother and sister.

269
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,270
Such a thing... could never happen, right?

270
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,910
...No.

271
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,980
...

272
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,940
How could it not happen?

273
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,030
Alright, Miyu! It's time to study.

274
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,670
Where is this coming from all of a sudden?

275
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,050
Well, I say study, but we'll start with things that are common sense, rather than the typical academic subjects.

276
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,560
Since you're always reading pretty much the same kind of books.

277
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,300
Oh?

278
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:36,030
Not that I mind, but why now of all times?

279
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,540
Because... I'm planning to take you outside soon.

280
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,010
Out... side...?

281
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:50,320
I know it may be hard to take that in right now, since your "world" has been confined to our home

282
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,470
But now I want to-

283
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,100
I want to see the ocean!

284
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,750
I want to see the place where the sky and water meet and I also want to experience the ocean breeze!

285
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,470
and hear the the sound and see the tidal waves!

286
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,000
Roger that.

287
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,270
We gotta earn it by studying, though.

288
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,480
We'll have to learn Traffic Laws, Ethics and more.

289
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,760
I'll learn it all right away.

290
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,740
Leave it to me, Shioru-sa-

291
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,340
No...

292
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,390
Onii-chan!

293
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:28,070
This place is nostalgic. I bet if Miyu went here, she could be with kids her age.

294
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,460
A kid?

295
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,030
What are you doing, Senpai?

296
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,460
Is there something going on with the elementary school?

297
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,300
No... It's nothing.

298
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,000
Ah, could it be, Senpai, that you like younger girls?

299
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,860
Huh?

300
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,630
If that's the case, I'm both an underclassman and a younger sister.

301
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,350
Younger sister? You had siblings, Sakura?

302
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,700
Yes. An older brother.

303
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,870
I see. I didn't know.

304
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,920
Senpai, can you tell what I'm thinking of right now?

305
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,470
Huh? Morning club activities?

306
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,950
Wrong

307
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,280
I was thinking... That this right now is the happiest time of my life.

308
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Happiest time?

309
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,040
Yup.

310
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,260
You may be mean to me sometimes, but you're nice too...

311
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,420
And I still go to school even if there aren't many students...

312
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,150
I get to study, and be in a club...

313
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:46,540
I think that being able to live mundane days like this... is what you call happiness.

314
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,230
Well, I guess that sounds corny, though.

315
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,350
No, it doesn't.

316
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,350
Eh?

317
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,190
I... think so too.

318
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,820
Wipe that stupid grin off your face.

319
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,440
Eh?

320
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,000
Sakura brought that up earlier too.

321
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,240
Something about how I look different from usual.

322
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,500
Your face looks more revolting than it normally does. What are you even happy about?

323
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,750
Hmmm... I saw this little girl behind the elementary school this morning.

324
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,070
I was looking at her from pretty far away, but I could tell she was cute...

325
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,300
Okay, hold up. You're thinking something totally off.

326
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,780
I was just wondering if she could be friends with my little sister!

327
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,350
I wasn't thinking anything weird.

328
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,740
Your sister?

329
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,740
I didn't know you had one.

330
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,740
Oh... yeah...

331
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,540
Her name is Miyu.

332
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,870
She's a good and smart kid.

333
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,530
Miyu...

334
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,800
Where was that kid I saw this morning from, though?

335
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:52,640
She had this blond hair that was tied up into a ringlet ponytail and gave off a foreign rich girl sorta vibe.

336
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,680
What are you doing?

337
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,280
Doesn't that burn?

338
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,720
Hell no, it doesn't.

339
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,060
What are you acting tough for?!

340
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,940
So, what you're saying is...

341
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:09,560
You've been smirking to yourself while thinking of your sister.

342
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,240
I don't like the way you phrased that...

343
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,460
Both you and Sakura are making too big a deal over me just smiling.

344
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,960
Let me tell you something.

345
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,450
I don't mind lies.

346
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:28,820
That said, "Fakes" that put on an act for no reason at all make me want to vomit.

347
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,300
Until now, that's what all your smiling was.

348
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,480
Your stupid grin today is indeed disgusting....

349
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,960
But since it's not an empty one, It's a thousand time better than that act.

350
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,960
I had no idea.

351
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,730
I feel bad for you.

352
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,320
Fakes just don't know how phony they really-

353
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,860
You get a lot more talkative when you put on sweatpants, huh?

354
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,270
Are you picking a fight, punk?

355
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,520
Alrighty then, I've decided.

356
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,700
I'll start making lunch for you too, starting tomorrow.

357
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,890
Huh? What does that have to do with anything?

358
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,980
Step screwing around.

359
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,510
Onii-chan. I'm ready.

360
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,760
Yeah, I'm coming right away.

361
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,780
It's finally time.

362
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,070
Are you scared?

363
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,930
Scared? Why would I be?

364
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,710
Because it's your-

365
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,340
Onii-chan, are we getting closer to the ocean?

366
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,540
We'll save that for later.

367
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,370
Later?

368
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,390
I've already long since decided on our first stop.

369
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,340
What are these?

370
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,060
They're...

371
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,160
Your real family's graves.

372
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:13,290
Do you remember? This is where you and I first met.

373
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,290
It's also your home where you were born.

374
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,400
My home? My mother's... everyone's graves?

375
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:31,700
It's strange... No matter how hard I try

376
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,460
I just can't seem to remember Much of anything.

377
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:44,810
But... I can still recall the warmth of my mother's hand.

378
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:52,800
I see. So, back then, I was left all alone.

379
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:00,410
I was alone, but then Kiritsugu-san and Onii-chan came and rescued me.

380
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,120
I have to tell her.

381
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,070
I'll tell her, and we'll start all over.

382
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,520
This time as a family!

383
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,050
No, Miyu. At the time, Kiritsugu and I...

384
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,930
didn't really save you.

385
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,550
Eh?

386
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:29,860
Why we came to this place... and why we later took you in...

387
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,250
wasn't for your sake.

388
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,320
Onii-chan... what are you saying...?

389
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,870
It was because...

390
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:41,270
we wanted to... use you as a tool to invoke a miracle.

391
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,470
To invoke a miracle... a tool...?

392
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,630
But Miyu, now I just-

393
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,880
That's boring..

394
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,840
Damn, that's boring.

395
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:01,670
That's the most boring development ever, you bastards.

396
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,070
So you were the one, Emiya Shirou!

397
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,820
Julian...!?

398
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,950
Why are you here?

399
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,620
That's the one without a doubt, right, Erika?

400
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,320
...Yup. Most of the characteristics are probably gone.

401
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,940
But... The Container is intact.

402
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,420
I've always monitored the area.

403
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,260
If someone intentionally enters

404
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,620
They either must be from The Sakatsuki family members that left

405
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,560
Or a thief.

406
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,640
What are you... talking about...?

407
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,000
Five years ago... The attack that swallowed the town

408
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,920
The pillar of light that removed it was activated from this very place.

409
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,220
I've been searching for it for so long

410
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,870
For the miracle of this world, and

411
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,400
The thief who stole it.

412
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,660
RUN, MIYU!!!

413
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,860
I'll handle him!

414
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,950
Run...? Where...?

415
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,380
What is that, Strengthening Magecraft?

416
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,020
Are you going to kill me with something like that?

417
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,420
Stop, Julian... Your hand...!

418
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,310
Why...

419
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,800
is that bastard someone like you...!

420
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,860
Fall.

421
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,420
Huh...?

422
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,680
Onii-chan!?

423
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,740
I've been looking for you for a long time.

424
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,560
The only true miracle that remains in this world.

425
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:47,300
Sakatsuki Miyu, from now on

426
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,840
you're something that belongs to me.

427
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,990
S-Stop it... Julian...!!

428
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,790
There will be no accident this time. It will probably be enough with just this Container.

429
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,790
...What are you talking about?

430
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,720
Although most of the city has been destroyed, a repeat of the ritual will never be any better than this

431
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,830
It must succeed this time.

432
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:14,020
You... Just what are you talking about, Julian!?

433
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,630
What's with that tone of your voice...

434
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,060
It's just like...

435
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,100
It's like...

436
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,910
You were the cause of that shadow!?

437
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,890
That's right.

438
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,820
I did it.

439
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,880
JULIAN!!

440
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,020
Are you injured, Julian-sama?

441
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,360
Like that would happen.

442
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,900
Take her and restart everything.

443
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,920
What about that man?

444
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,310
...Leave him be.

445
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,140
He's already worthless.

446
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,320
Ju...lian...

447
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,850
...You're finally awake?

448
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,810
...Dad...?

449
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,160
...I regret to tell you this, but I'm not your father.

450
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,980
This place...

451
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,650
It's better if you don't move recklessly.

452
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,530
It's been a long time since I've healed someone. I can't guarantee the results.

453
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,200
Who are you? You... rescued me?

454
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,120
Helping a drowning person is the extent of something I would still do.

455
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,680
I'm still a priest, after all.

456
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,560
A priest...?

457
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,180
Welcome to the Holy Church of Fuyuki.

458
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:18,860
I'm a priest that is responsible for witnessing the end of this world. Welcome, lost lamb.

459
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,430
I'm thankful you saved me, but...

460
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:26,870
I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry. I'll have to thank you at a later time.

461
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:35,180
Where are you going? You don't even know where Sakatsuki Miyu has been taken.

462
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,680
...Don't tell me. You also...

463
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,030
Not only rash, but also wrong.

464
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:51,950
Lost child, what you need to do now is understand what is happening first.

465
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,870
Observe

466
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,520
Analyze

467
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,830
And act.

468
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,320
If you don't, you'll make the same mistake again.

469
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,760
Who are you? How do you know about Miyu?

470
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,300
No need to be alarmed, I'm only someone who monitors and observes.

471
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,670
I don't intend any harm to her.

472
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,390
Like I'd believ-

473
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,390
Don't be mistaken, boy.

474
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:26,900
What you should know now is, the identity of the people who kidnapped Sakatsuki Miyu and their goals.

475
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:32,250
And not suspect an observer on the sidelines who never interfered.

476
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,310
Please tell me... their goal and true identity.

477
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,050
Ainsworth.

478
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,090
They are famous as a magus family that continues their thousand-year journey.

479
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:51,320
But their only magic specialty is basic "Displacement Magecraft" trash.

480
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,390
Ainsworth...?

481
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:59,500
They have always embraced the same wish for a thousand of years.

482
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:05,210
An overly grand, overly childish and overly idealistic wish.

483
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,780
Do you know what that is?

484
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,420
Why would I know something like that?

485
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,800
If it's you, you should be able to understand it.

486
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,080
It can't be...

487
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,200
The continuation of humanity's history.

488
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:26,430
without caring about the method, saving the doomed humanity is the wish of the Ainsworth.

489
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:31,050
They captured Sakatsuki Miyu to wish for humanity's salvation.

490
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,920
Is that not justice?

491
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,740
The same justice... dad wanted...

492
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:49,580
It was 200 years ago when the Ainsworth sought after the Holy Grail that surpasses the human method and created the ritual.

493
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:56,430
There have already been four instances of that ritual, the Holy Grail Wars, but all have ended in failure.

494
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,700
Holy Grail Wars?

495
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,980
A ritual of slaughter, and the winner obtains the Holy Grail.

496
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:09,270
The fourth war had the worst ending possible, five years ago. You witnessed it yourself, right?

497
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,150
In this war, the previous head of the Ainsworth,

498
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:19,780
alongside the others who helped him, were completely destroyed and Julian was the only survivor.

499
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:28,870
However, Julian is planning on restarting the ritual himself by using Sakatsuki Miyu as the Holy Grail for the fifth war

500
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,160
All for the sake of saving humanity.

501
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,270
Don't fuck with me! What do you mean it's for the sake of humanity!!

502
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,920
He caused that massive crater! How many people do you think were sacrificed for that ritual?

503
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,920
"Saving humanity"?... In the end, all it caused was tragedy!!

504
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:51,700
"In the end", huh. Don't jump to conclusions so quickly.

505
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,240
The human race is destined for ruin.

506
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,610
What the Ainsworths saw was the horizon beyond the future.

507
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,370
Not branches, but the tree trunks.

508
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,790
Not trees, but the forest.

509
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,220
Not individuals, but the community.

510
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:09,270
To abandon and sacrifice the minority and fulfill your duty

511
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,700
Are you going to reject that?

512
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,700
That's...

513
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,070
Then, make your choice, Emiya Shirou.

514
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,960
To observe, or to oppose.

515
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:25,830
No matter which choice you make, the justice you're shouldering will crumble into pieces.

516
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,810
At any rate, I need to meet with Julian again and verify of all this.

517
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,630
Ainsworth's atelier is in the center of the crater.

518
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,340
However, as you are now...

519
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,580
That can't be...

520
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,420
...I see.

521
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:06,050
You won't even allow meeting... the fake who only admired justice?

522
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,270
GET OUT HERE, JULIAN!

523
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,270
I KNOW YOU'RE THERE!!

524
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:15,920
I admit it!!! I'm a form of justice, a form of family

525
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,650
A form of human only imitating these things to cover myself, an empty shell...!!

526
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,670
I was wrong from the start...

527
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,000
Even I know that...!

528
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,800
But... That's why I...

529
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,120
Wanted to start being something real...!!

530
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,540
I still have something... that I didn't manage to tell her yet

531
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,270
Give Miyu...

532
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,800
Give my sister back to me...

533
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:55,300
After that day, Julian stopped appearing.

534
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,050
I made the wrong choice.

535
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,700
Even so, time still marches on cruelly.

536
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,680
No effect... huh.

537
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:26,300
That fake of a priest, even making me pay so much money for these black keys...

538
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,270
Senpai?

539
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,120
Sakura...

540
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,800
Why are you here...?

541
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,400
I was on my way home after buying groceries. What a coincidence.

542
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,350
Senpai?

543
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,800
No... it's nothing.

544
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,170
Wow, it looks delicious...!

545
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,390
I knew Senpai was awesome!

546
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:18,460
Even housewives would feel ashamed after seeing Senpai's cooking.

547
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,680
It's nothing special.

548
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,360
I never thought I'd get to have such a feast in Senpai's home...

549
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,100
Thansk for the food.

550
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,820
I'm sorry, I'm not around school nowadays...

551
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,520
No, don't say that.

552
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:39,200
Although, I got really worried about you, I'm just glad you're not sick.

553
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,420
It's just...

554
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:46,200
Pulling bows alone... Walking home alone...

555
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,220
It felt so lonely...

556
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,070
I'm so thankful for today.

557
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:58,250
Senpai's cooking was really delicious.

558
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,240
Sorry... I probably won't come to school for a while.

559
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,980
If you're okay with it, you can visit my home again.

560
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,880
...Although I'm happy about this invitation

561
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,180
This is the last time.

562
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:19,220
You don't need to be shy. I don't really mind-

563
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,220
It's the last time!

564
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,560
I also... Actually, I really want to be with Senpai more

565
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,350
Going to school... Attending activities...

566
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:33,140
Walking home together... Saying "See you tomorrow"...

567
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:40,000
It's just that... I treasured those small things...

568
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,970
Sakura...

569
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,870
But even that has to end

570
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,120
Because the Holy Grail War has begun.

571
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,470
What are you... saying...?

572
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,000
Sakura... Why do you...

573
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,870
know about that term...?

574
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,300
Of course I know about it.

575
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,300
The Matou are one of the families that helped create that ritual.

576
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,120
YOU WERE DECEIV-

577
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:19,150
...That's unfortunate. I thought you'd be more flustered.

578
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,310
...How should I put it?

579
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,190
I think I've gotten used to losing everything

580
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:30,020
A "loss". So that's how you look at it, huh?

581
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,920
Hey, Sakura.

582
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,880
Did you come to finish me off?

583
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,770
I knew it. Senpai is such a bully..

584
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:49,750
The Holy Grail War principally uses these Servant cards, Heroic Spirits, to fight as basis for the ritual.

585
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,430
The Heroic Spirit of this card is the King of Heroes, Gilgamesh.

586
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:57,420
This is the strongest card, without a doubt.

587
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,600
This card...

588
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,680
I'll let Senpai have it.

589
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,740
...But why?

590
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:09,970
If you want to rescue Miyu-chan, you'll have to become the winner of the Holy Grail War.

591
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,800
With this card, it may no longer be impossible.

592
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,860
But...

593
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,870
Sakura...?

594
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,600
There is one thing... If it's possible...

595
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,100
If it can be granted...

596
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,180
Please run away instead!

597
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:35,510
Whether it's magic or Miyu-chan, forget all of that and run away from this town!

598
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:41,130
If Senpai... If Senpai would do that...

599
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,610
I would give up everything together with you...!

600
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,650
Sakura.

601
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,100
I'm sorry, I-

602
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,450
SAKURA!

603
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:05,570
Slutty. You're too slutty.

604
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,150
Who are you!?

605
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:14,850
Oh man, oh man, oh man... You're such a slutty sister, Sakura.

606
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:21,350
Let your brother co... co... correct?... correct you as necessary.

607
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,420
B... Brother...

608
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,760
Brother...!?

609
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,770
You're Sakura's brother? Then why are you...

610
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:36,050
That 's right. I'm the legitimate successor of the Matou family. My name is Matou...

611
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,450
......What was it again...?

612
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:44,620
Oh well. If I kill those two, who knows? I might remember something.

613
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,850
Trace on!

614
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,550
Senpai!

615
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,500
Huh? Hey hey, what was that about? This is strange...

616
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,970
WHY WAS MY ATTACK BLOCKED!!!???

617
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:03,120
Why? Why? Why WHY? Why did you block my attack?

618
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,020
WHY DID YOU BLOCK IT!!!???

619
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,290
This way, Sakura!

620
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:31,570
Be careful, Senpai. That Heroic Spirit is...

621
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,300
Sakura! Your wound!

622
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,520
I-It's alright. More importantly-

623
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:45,420
And here I am, taking grand action for humanity's sake and ideals.

624
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,770
But you just keep getting in my way...

625
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:52,080
I'll kill you after I'm done with her.

626
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,390
SO WAIT YOUR TURN!

627
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,140
Senpai!

628
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,910
Run away, Sakura...!

629
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,950
I can't...

630
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,850
Throw... everything... away...

631
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,650
Don't worry about me!

632
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:08,620
Escape by yourself...

633
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,450
and find happiness away from here...!

634
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,010
Saku...ra?

635
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:21,430
I'll... defeat you, brother!

636
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,010
Heeh?

637
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,490
You grew a backbone, Sakura!?

638
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,890
On top of opposing your brother, you're going to "defeat me"?

639
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,890
Did that what's-his-name over there seduce you or something?

640
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:37,820
What a horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE LITTLE SISTER YOU ARE!

641
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:42,670
With a sister like you, I guess I have no choice

642
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,020
But to kill you...!!

643
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,480
D-don't do it, Sakura! For siblings to kill each other...

644
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,270
It's okay.

645
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,330
My brother has been dead for a long time.

646
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,780
Also...

647
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:03,840
You didn't choose me

648
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:09,400
But... I love you, so I'll protect you.

649
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
Sakura...!!

650
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,350
It'll be fine. Since I have this card, I'll win for sure!

651
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,450
INSTALL!

652
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,660
What's wrong, Sakura!?

653
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,460
Don't tell me you can't even install!?

654
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,580
It can't be... Why...!?

655
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,150
We already knew you might betray us!

656
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:53,450
Did you really think Julian-sama would give you the Gilgamesh card!?

657
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:57,270
It isn't connected to a Heroic Spirit.

658
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:02,590
It's a genuine garbage card through and through!

659
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,150
Garbage... card...?

660
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:12,540
Oh boy. It seems your brother has to teach you how to use the cards.

661
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,770
RUN SAKURA!!!

662
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,860
Sen... pai...

663
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,650
Dead Heartbeat Melody

664
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,650
ZABANIYA!

665
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:22,850
I'm Sorry...

666
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:39,350
...Huh?

667
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,650
Huh huh? huh?

668
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:44,650
What did I do...?

669
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,650
Where did Sakura go...?

670
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:54,170
Maybe... Yeah,  yeah now I remember.

671
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:59,750
I sEeEeEeEEeeeE! I KilLeEEeEeeEd HeR!!!!

672
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,050
Why...

673
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,720
You see, I'll have to kill lots of people in this war

674
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,930
And I want them to suffer as much as possible...

675
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,770
LET ME PRACTICE WITH YOU!

676
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,880
Yeah...

677
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,270
I've lost...

678
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,340
and lost...

679
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,480
and lost...

680
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,460
And I'm the only thing that remained behind...

681
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,220
You're still alive?

682
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:52,190
I have a better grasp on using Assassin now.                 Can I kill you already?

683
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,660
I'll even listen to your last words.

684
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,840
I bet it'll be the same as Sakura, right?

685
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,020
Hey...

686
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,240
Hah...?

687
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,860
Tell... me...

688
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,870
How...

689
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,200
did it feel...

690
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,550
to murder your own sister?

691
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,660
BETTER THAN EJACULATING A HUNDRED TIMES!

692
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,640
YOU SHOULD TRY IT YOURSELF!

693
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:35,080
Farewell. It was fun. Err... What was your name again?

694
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,000
There's no moon.

695
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,000
Miracle

696
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,180
Hope

697
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,180
There are no stars...

698
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,990
Oh yeah, I remembered.

699
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,700
Well then, once again...

700
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,390
The path... is dissolving in Darkness...

701
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,460
Goodbye... Emiya.

702
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,020
However... still...

703
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,830
My body remains!

704
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,720
ARM!

705
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,150
MY... AAAAARM!!!

706
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,180
What the hell are you!?

707
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:23,430
Sakura's card was undeniably a garbage card.

708
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,830
This is weird... Installing it should be impossible!

709
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,430
What the hell!?

710
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:31,880
WHO THE HELL IS THAT HEROIC SPIRIT!?

711
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:31,880
CARD

712
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,100
What the hell!? What the hell!!?

713
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,860
WHAT THE HELL!!!???

714
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,920
STAY AWAY!

715
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,940
Don't get confident!

716
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,720
My arm still moves even if you cut it off-

717
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,080
I never heard about this!

718
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,430
Hey. What's with that attitude...?

719
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,660
Hey, hey. Don't tell me just because of that...

720
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,760
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me...

721
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,110
YOU THINK YOU'RE STRONGER THAN ME...?

722
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:29,160
I'd say you are...

723
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,860
Not suited to be an Assassin.

724
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,620
Even you... you're...

725
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,050
MAKING FUN OF ME!!!!!

726
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,400
Projection Start

727
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,400
Trace on!

728
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:01,520
What's that... IT BarELy itcHEEeeeS!

729
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:13,400
i'm ThE strOnGeS! I'M thE sTRongEST!!!

730
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,580
That's far...

731
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,380
from the strongest.

732
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,840
yoUUUU bAASTaaaARd!!!!!!!

733
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,280
BURST!

734
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,590
You're still barking...

735
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,550
If that's the case...

736
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,350
I'll blow you away

737
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,240
until there's nothing left.

738
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:15,110
I love... watching Senpai... shoot.

739
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:22,340
Sakura...

740
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,380
Thank you.

741
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:43,580
H... Ho.... How did you...!?

742
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:48,070
Why did you notice...!?

743
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,270
You told me yourself.

744
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:55,350
"My arm still moves even if you cut it off".

745
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:00,550
Midway through the fight, that monster became an empty decoy.

746
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:12,460
N-no... I don't wanna die...

747
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,930
I don't wanna die.

748
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,640
Sakura thought the same.

749
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:21,690
I'M NOT STUPID, I KNOW THAT!

750
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,250
NO ONE IN THE WORLD WANTS TO DIE!

751
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,440
THAT'S WHY JULIAN-SAMA...!

752
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,940
...

753
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:37,160
I've... finally...

754
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,590
remembered everything.

755
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:49,240
FUCK "JULIAN-SAMA"! SHIT! SHIT!

756
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,730
I was already gone long ago...

757
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,970
...I've had enough

758
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:02,410
Kill me... Emiya.

759
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,080
Where...

760
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,460
Hmm?

761
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,390
What... is this?

762
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:38,410
Oh? This is strange.

763
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:44,140
I'm surprised that you walked over here, I thought you would run away as soon as you woke.

764
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,030
Run? What's the point?

765
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,500
Oh?

766
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:56,460
From the very start... at that house... and in this place, I was always intended to be a tool, wasn't I?

767
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,430
Hahahahaha, what wonderful resignation!

768
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:04,540
That's it... That's... it...

769
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:10,880
Though it's slowly coming together, it's still not enough...

770
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:17,820
I agree as well. You are already a part of the Ainsworths.

771
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,040
There's nothing else you can do but to surrender your fate.

772
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:27,920
The conclusion of the legend is already set. Stop thinking about unnecessary things.

773
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:33,300
This is the sole happiness you can get as a tool, and not a person

774
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,830
Remember this feeling.

775
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,070
From now on you're gonna kill lots of people, right?

776
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:52,290
I'll... pass.

777
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:57,480
I'll go ahead and wait for you in hell.

778
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,500
A doll...?

779
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:05,400
My brother has been dead for a long time.

780
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,280
This is "Displacement Magecraft".

781
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:15,170
Hell, huh?

782
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:21,420
I... won't be going there just yet.

783
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,050
Install.

784
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:43,940
The people precious to me are gone.

785
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:48,200
I threw away my pride.

786
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:54,860
I threw even my bare self. And in the process, I became empty.

787
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,420
I-Impossible...!

788
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:17,800
After losing everything, my goals became clear.

789
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:32,780
I have to win...

790
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,860
I... I...

791
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,550
have to take back...

792
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,670
Who... in the hell...

793
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,220
Who... in the hell... is that... Heroic Spirit...?

794
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,690
EMIYA.

795
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,740
Heroic Spirit... Emiya?

796
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,300
Well, well.

797
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,310
Ah. You look so beautiful today, just like an inorganic matter

798
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:51,580
I see, I see. Emiya

799
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:56,550
If I'm remembering correctly, this is the form of your future self?

800
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,310
No answer, huh?

801
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,460
Fervor, mei sanguis.

802
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,460
Boil, my blood

803
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,100
Scalp

804
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,100
Slash

805
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:14,800
Hmph. I've heard that there's no concept of time in the Throne of Heroes.

806
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,630
I suppose this is also possible.

807
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:20,420
Scalp

808
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:20,420
Slash

809
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,890
Such a weapon will never reach me.

810
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,620
I told you it's no use.

811
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,820
Wh...at...? This... power...

812
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:42,090
What... are you...?

813
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,060
Alaya

814
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,060
Someone who made a pact with the World.

815
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:50,280
A Guardian of Humanity.

816
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:54,500
Yes, the power of the Guardian...

817
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,130
Meant for Humanity's sake...

818
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:01,270
With it, I will...

819
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,820
With such power, I will...

820
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:16,890
EXCALIBUR !

821
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:16,890
Sword of Promised Victory

822
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,670
Fine by me...

823
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:47,500
We've gone this far, so I'll keep playing your game...

824
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,720
UNTIL ONE OF US BREAKS!

825
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:01,100
I'll leave Julian... to you...

826
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,540
Splendid, Emiya Shirou.

827
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:19,500
You have defeated all of your opponents and collected all seven cards.

828
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,790
For this Holy Grail War... victory is yours.

829
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,390
Kotomine.

830
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:32,550
Even if you would execute your friend's father to get here.

831
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,260
Hold your head high, boy.

832
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:41,820
You've opened what was meant to be a dead end with your own two hands.

833
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,920
With these seven cards, go and see your sister.

834
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:48,360
Where is Miyu?

835
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:54,580
In order to summon the Holy Grail, she must be at that place.

836
01:03:55,320 --> 01:04:02,470
Miunt Enzo, a place a dragon once welled. Deep within it lies a vast underground cavern.

837
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:05,930
That place... is where your fate awaits.

838
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:22,940
It's been a terribly long time.

839
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:25,400
How are you doing

840
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,540
Julian?

841
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:33,790
Give Miyu back.

842
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:38,640
That... would be betraying mankind.

843
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:49,350
In her lies a method of of saving the human race from this planet full of tragedies and certain doom.

844
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:56,010
To throw it all away for that petty goddamned sentimentality of yours.

845
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:02,710
I can't even laugh at it. I really can't. Doing something like that...

846
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:04,940
MAKES YOU THE WORST KIND OF EVIL.

847
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:09,750
I see. So that's how it was.

848
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:15,030
You too, were fighting alone this entire time.

849
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,670
Don't act like you understand...!

850
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:19,000
But I do.

851
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,280
Kill one to save the many.

852
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:26,540
I knew someone like that.

853
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,840
Yes. But even so...

854
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,930
Even so, I'll...

855
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,090
I'm sorry, Kiritsugu...

856
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:46,150
Even if it's a mistake...

857
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,350
I'll... walk this path instead.

858
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:53,180
Julian...

859
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:57,180
You're like another possibility of mine.

860
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,540
A me who chose a different path.

861
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:08,620
Did you know, about Miyu's family... About The Sakatsuki family.

862
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:17,350
The kept records from the first generation down to Miyu's.

863
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:28,250
The Children of God who can grant any wish, what would the family who controls all of that power wish for, do you know?

864
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:40,460
They simply wished for their children to grow up healthy.

865
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:44,390
They could've wished for wealth and prosperity

866
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:49,300
But all they ever asked for was what any parent would've wanted for their children

867
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,700
And not a single exception over four hundred years.

868
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:57,140
If that is considered evil...

869
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,820
Then I'll be evil.

870
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:01,290
O... Nii-...chan...?

871
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:07,320
Sorry, for making you wait so long...

872
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,510
Why... did you come?

873
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:16,810
Back then, Onii-chan said it himself...

874
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:21,320
That the reason you and Kiritsugu-san took me in...

875
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,850
Was to use my... power...

876
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:28,300
That I am... just a tool.

877
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,150
So then why...

878
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:32,180
Did you come here...1?

879
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:45,040
I'll continue... telling you what I really wanted you to know, but couldn't.

880
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,160
It goes without saying.

881
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:06,080
It's because I'm an older brother.

882
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,380
So I have to protect my younger sister, don't I?

883
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:24,050
It's been one mistake after another with me, so this might be one too.

884
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:29,450
But, for this alone is true,

885
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,220
I wish upon the Holy Grail.

886
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,200
I pray you find a world where you won't have to suffer any longer.

887
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,780
I pray that you meet kind people.

888
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:46,540
I pray that you find friends you can laugh with.

889
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,380
I pray you find... a warm, small...

890
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,640
Share of happiness.

891
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:40,410
O...Onii-...cha...

892
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,580
Sorry,

893
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,500
But my little sister is working her hardest right now.

894
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:24,350
Could you wait just a little longer?

895
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,240
I cannot...

896
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:30,120
Your wish will not be granted.

897
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:37,440
A Faker who slipped into the Holy Grail War

898
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,380
shall not seize the miracle...!

899
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,600
So that's the true Archer card... Gilgamesh, huh?

900
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:59,740
With no card, for a mere flesh and blood human, to stand against the King of Heroes, is the epitome of foolishness.

901
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:07,720
Be it western or eastern, ancient or modern, all of humanity's treasures are this Heroic Spirit's power.

902
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:15,030
I see... So that's why Sakura called it the "Strongest Card".

903
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,170
You...

904
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:21,810
Humanity... Humanity, huh?

905
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:26,850
That's big, bigger than words to express.

906
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:33,270
It must be an enormous burden you guys are carrying.

907
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,540
But you know...

908
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:40,410
I've got someone I'm responsible for too.

909
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:44,760
Be it personal feelings, or be it sentimentality,

910
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:49,760
Both are completely worthless in this World.

911
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:53,030
Trace.. On!

912
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:59,360
"Trace"...!? It can't be.

913
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,700
That fighting style...!

914
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:09,700
Possessed by the embodiment of that heroic ideal, a future different path,

915
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:16,360
Having faced many battles, I perfected my future skills and Magic Circuits,

916
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:19,010
And even inherited his Origin.

917
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,610
No... It might be better to say...

918
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:25,970
Every time this body fought,

919
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:28,160
it was being invaded by Heroic Spirit EMIYA!

920
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,810
What was that about a Mere flesh and blood human?

921
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:35,340
You're slow on the uptake, King of Heroes.

922
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,070
What you're facing

923
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:38,520
is a true imitation

924
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,520
of a Heroic Spirit!!

925
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:42,620
Lowly Faker!

926
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:18,100
...Your body should be at the point of no return, yet the speed and strength of your projection is increasing.

927
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:23,520
I do not know what trick you are using, but it's useless.

928
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,850
The only thing that awaits you...

929
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:28,250
is certain ruin.

930
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,320
...I know.

931
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:35,870
The reason I was able to survive those battles...

932
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:39,290
What you labeled as "useless",

933
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:41,410
is my connection with her.

934
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:46,760
I lasted until now because of Miyu's support.

935
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:46,760
Magical Energy

936
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:49,300
I'm such a pathetic big brother, aren't I?

937
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:54,580
But, that's precisely why...

938
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:58,350
I'm standing here and now

939
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:01,580
to use up what's left of my life!!!

940
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,900
My body is made of swords.

941
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,900
———I am the bone of my sword.

942
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:18,180
Steel is my body and fire is my blood.

943
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:18,180
My blood is of iron. And my heart is of glass.

944
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:22,130
I have created over a thousand blades.

945
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:22,130
I have overcame countless battlefields.

946
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:24,980
Never once retreating.

947
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:24,980
Unaware of beginning

948
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,700
Nor once attaining victory.

949
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,700
nor aware of end.

950
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:30,360
The orphan is alone again,

951
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:30,360
Withstood pain with inconsistent weapons.

952
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,610
Striking diamond dust on a hill of swords.

953
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,610
My hands will never hold anything.

954
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:34,900
But,

955
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:34,900
—————Yet,

956
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,360
This life is not yet over.

957
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,360
my flame never ends.

958
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,180
My whole body was

959
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,180
This fallen body was still

960
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:45,050
"Unlimited Blade Works"

961
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:45,050
Still made of swords——!!

962
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:56,140
This world...

963
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,780
Fantasy and reality,

964
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:04,480
Inside and outside, overwriting the world with one's own mind.

965
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:12,810
The Innermost Magecraft, Reality Marble.

966
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:14,840
Hey...

967
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:17,490
What do you think of it?

968
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,760
It's a world encompassing an infinite number of swords.

969
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:26,830
But to me... they're more like graves.

970
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:32,120
Sorry, but please keep me company

971
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:35,410
Until my blades run out.

972
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:35,410
Until my body gives out.

973
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,570
As you wish, a puppet like you who mimics the dead, I shall sink to the bottom of those graves.

974
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:05,030
He was a step ahead of me?

975
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:06,010
Too slow!

976
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,570
Don't make light...

977
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:16,030
of The Ainsworth.

978
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,120
Spacial Displacement!

979
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,450
Playtime is over.

980
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:28,030
Come forth,

981
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:28,030
Ig-Alima!

982
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:28,030
Mountain Felling Sword

983
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,030
Sul-sagana!

984
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,030
Reduce to Ashes

985
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,500
Your very existence is flawed.

986
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,680
To the last legend we have written and put into motion for humanity,

987
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,110
you may prove to be a hindrance.

988
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:30,630
Your irksome ability, your strange use of Magecraft, and your abhorrent self-destructive conviction...

989
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,520
They will all be torn to pieces

990
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:46,980
Along with your world.

991
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:51,920
Yeah...

992
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,310
There's no sword in this world that could stand equal to this sword.

993
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,030
So...

994
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:01,940
while it may be a bit rude,

995
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,940
I'll have to pay you back...

996
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:08,810
WITH ALL THE SWORDS I HAVE IN STOCK!!

997
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,140
Return to the beginning——

998
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:13,520
ENUMA ELISH!!!

999
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:13,520
The Star of Creation that Split Heaven and Earth

1000
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:25,320
It's futile, even if you pile all of your blades together,

1001
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,690
THEY ARE NO MATCH FOR THE GREATEST SWORD!

1002
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:38,410
Yeah... you got that right.

1003
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:44,920
There are times when just one thing can outweigh everything else.

1004
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,190
Ah, this is bad...

1005
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:57,400
I wonder if she'll be mad at me... for forgetting about our promise to see the ocean.

1006
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:09,470
I... failed to be a hero who could save others....

1007
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:27,010
But...

1008
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,250
I won...

1009
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:35,930
Kiritsugu...

1010
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:30,010
So, we decided we're raking a break from you two.

1011
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:31,740
Hold on a sec-

1012
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:31,740
Wait right there-

1013
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:48,560
Good grief, Luvia-sama is such a handful...

1014
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,660
Even though we were in the middle of the mission of collecting the cards.

1015
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:53,280
Cards?

1016
01:22:56,850 --> 01:23:00,610
What you were saying...tell me more about it.

1017
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:03,720
Sapphire! Sapphire!

1018
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:09,580
Geez, if someone discovered that this happened, what would we do?

1019
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:17,700
To have a "Share of happiness" was Onii-chan's wish that I received

1020
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:23,030
But, the current me doesn't have anything...

1021
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:27,490
Nor anything I used to have, so...

1022
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:34,950
What everyone has for granted, their life necessities. I'll start by acquiring those.

1023
01:23:39,650 --> 01:23:42,210
Sapphire! Where are yo-

1024
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,030
Y-You're...?

1025
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:49,010
I'll handle collecting the cards.

1026
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:56,050
So, in return, give me a place to live, give me food, give me clothes,

1027
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:58,160
Give me

1028
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,670
a place to belong.

1029
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:04,540
Magecraft may have no effect, but bundles of pure mana should do it!

1030
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,320
It brushed me! I-It just brushed past me!

1031
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,340
Do your best!

1032
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,210
This is...?

1033
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:14,520
Hmph, don't mind them. It's just a show of failure.

1034
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:17,920
Just do what you need to do.

1035
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,560
Understood.

1036
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:24,010
The Ainsworth's cards'.

1037
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:27,220
I have... to retrieve all of them.

1038
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:30,410
Class card: Lancer.

1039
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:31,630
Include.

1040
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:43,410
Gáe Bolg!

1041
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:43,410
Barbed Spear that Pierces with Death

1042
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:57,250
Lancer: Un-include. Retrieved Class card successfully.

1043
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:02,650
Rider.  Collecting complete.

1044
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:08,940
W-Who... Who is this...?

1045
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,430
You'll be fine, Miyu.

1046
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,560
Knowing you,

1047
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,900
You'll make friends in no time.

1048
01:25:21,980 --> 01:27:44,850


1049
01:25:21,980 --> 01:27:44,850


1050
01:25:21,980 --> 01:27:44,850


1051
01:25:21,980 --> 01:27:44,850

1052
01:25:21,980 --> 01:27:44,850


1053
01:25:21,980 --> 01:27:44,850


1054
01:25:21,980 --> 01:27:44,850
Special Thanks

1055
01:25:21,980 --> 01:27:44,850
