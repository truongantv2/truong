1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033


2
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,760
A man dreamt

3
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,660
Of the world's salvation

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,980
Another man chose

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,120
The survival of his species

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,440
And I wished for

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,880
A single person's happiness

8
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,020
Beast's Lair & Astro Subs

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,020
Oath Under the Snow

10
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,820
The Sakatsuki family?

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,540
Yes.

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,920
It's a family with an old history

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,880
tracing back to the roots of Fuyuki.

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,900
There's nothing special to mention about them, except for their long history...

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,750
But there's something strange.

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,820
Strange?

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,900
No one ever witnesses the birth of children in that household.

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,840
What does that mean?

19
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,100
After age 6, they'll suddenly appear, out of nowhere in this world.

20
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:25,250
Recovered from diseases, adopted from another family, children of relatives.

21
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,750
This is the remnant of the "Child Religion".

22
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,150
"Child Religion"...?

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,000
Divinity until age 6.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Children of age 6 and below are closer to God or spirits than any human.

25
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,000
It's that kind of religion.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,300
In that case, if those children are close to God and spirits, then your wish...

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:56,350
The possibility isn't high that this Child of God in hiding might be the power we need.

28
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,350
Still...

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,600
If the possibility does exist...

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,100
Then it's worth a try from us, Heroes of Justice!

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
How many times do I have to tell you?

32
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,950
I'm not a Hero of Justice or anything like that.

33
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,950
Yeah, yeah...

34
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,950
You're humble, I know.

35
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,460
What is the matter?

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,460
This... is...

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,760
What is that...?

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,400
What is happening...?

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,100
This phenomenon is far beyond humans...!

40
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,530
This is bad Kiritsugu!

41
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,400
That black thing... is expanding!

42
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,660
Get in the car, Shirou.

43
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,840
We're leaving.

44
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,400
What are you talking about, Kiritsugu?

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,930
At this rate, the city...

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,800
It's okay as long as it stays in the city...!

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,200
We don't know how much further it'll expand...!

48
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,490
It might even reach all the way here...

49
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,130
No, in the worst case scenario, it'll engulf the entire country...!

50
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,900
But that's why we-

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,600
We can't go further by car...

52
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,600
Kiritsugu, I'm going!

53
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Wait, Shirou!

54
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,200
Shirou!

55
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,430
You are...?

56
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,760
Watch out!

57
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,330
Don't collapse yet...!!!

58
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,460
What was that!?

59
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,130
Can't breath...

60
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,200
Was that her doing?

61
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,680
This is the first hug... since Mother...

62
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,500
Sakatsuki Miyu.

63
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,130
The hidden descendant of the Child of God of The Sakatsuki family.

64
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:21,760
It looks like they set up a Bounded Field inside the house. Her birth and upbringing must've been inside.

65
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,760
Then what exactly is the Child of God?

66
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,330
Why did they lock such a small girl inside?

67
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,460
Shirou...

68
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,030
Looks like, we may have finally found it.

69
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,730
Huh?

70
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,600
The Sakatsuki Child of God... their characteristics...

71
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
is the power to grant human wishes unconditionally.

72
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,500
Their magus set up a Bounded Field to block outside human thought.

73
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,300
For six years, The Sakatsuki kept the children apart from other humans and relied only on their mothers...

74
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,130
just to return their Child of God into a regular human child.

75
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,830
But something unexpected happened.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,760
Their magus disappeared after that black shadow arrived and the Bounded Field collapsed as a result.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,520
Suddenly, Humanity's cries reached Miyu.

78
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,600
Humanity's cries?

79
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,400
The journey has ended, Shirou.

80
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,280
I will use this child.

81
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,750
And in this land of Fuyuki,

82
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,100
Humanity will be saved.

83
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,830
Um, Miyu is your name, right?

84
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,100
I'm Emiya Shirou. Pleased to meet you.

85
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,560
Emiya... Shirou...

86
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,100
Right, that's my name.

87
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,060
Emiya Shirou...

88
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,560
Just Shirou is fine.

89
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,760
Shirou...

90
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:56,760
Right. Since we'll be living together now, we're... like a family.

91
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,230
Like a family...

92
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,760
Yeah.

93
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,900
And that other person is Emiya Kiritsugu.

94
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,200
He's my adoptive father, mentor and a Hero of Justice.

95
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,920
Adoptive father... a Hero of Justice...?

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,200
Yeah. I lost my parents due to an accident when I was little.

97
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,030
And Kiritsugu saved me back then.

98
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,730
You see, Kiritsugu is a weird person.

99
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:39,630
He has an ideal to bring eternal peace to this pain and suffering-filled world.

100
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,060
So, my adoptive father is a Hero of Justice.

101
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,960
Ah, I guess what I'm saying doesn't make sense to you.

102
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,100
Oh, it's about time I made the food.

103
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,760
Is there something you want to eat in particular?

104
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,800
Not really.

105
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,000
Then, is there something you hate?

106
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,900
No.

107
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,060
Okay. Then please sit tight and wait for me.

108
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,650
Wanna try it?

109
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,400
Kirtsugu, dinner's ready.

110
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:21,840
...yeah.

111
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,630
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

112
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,630
Just one more step.

113
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,300
Still...

114
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,680
We have the wish-granting device to save humanity

115
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,430
But I have no idea how to use it.

116
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,230
Um... Kiritsuigu?

117
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,700
Miyu's sixth birthday is tomorrow, right?

118
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,160
Yes, that's right.

119
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,130
So, will we have a celebration or...?

120
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,660
What are you talking about?

121
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,000
Like I said, it can be a simple birthday celebration...

122
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,160
Kiritsugu?

123
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,530
Celebrate?

124
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,370
Celebrate that the Child of God is becoming more human?

125
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,700
We have no idea how long the Child can retain its wish-granting powers.

126
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,960
Is it based on Fuyuki's leylines?

127
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Is it based on her age?

128
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,960
Who knows, she may even lose her powers the moment she turns six years old.

129
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,950
We do have have an obligation to take care of that "thing".

130
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,600
Up to the point of providing her clothes and food is fine, as long as it doesn't cause any changes to it.

131
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,500
But don't misunderstand.

132
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:32,220
That "thing" is no more than the means to save everything.

133
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,300
I know it. I know he is correct.

134
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,400
Miyu is just a tool to save humanity.

135
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,700
Don't see her as a human...!!

136
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,430
Don't develop feelings for her..!!

137
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,460
Shirou.

138
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,400
Let's play.

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,760
Kiritsugu!?

140
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,960
I don't have long.

141
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,160
If that's the case...

142
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,630
Yes. I know my duty.

143
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:24,130
Not long after that, Kiritsugu passed away peacefully in his sleep.

144
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,740
- Five Years Later -

145
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,260
I finished the repairs, Student Council President.

146
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,440
I see. Thanks for the hard work.

147
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,600
Alright, shall we have lunch, Julian?

148
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,710
Emiya Shirou, why are you having your lunch here?

149
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,190
Let's see...

150
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,530
I guess this is the only place to make tea?

151
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,260
If you weren't here, then this would be my personal place.

152
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,310
Come on, don't say that.

153
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,310
Is that all you're having for lunch?

154
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,970
Didn't I tell you that I'd cook your portion too?

155
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,970
Don't say such disgusting things.

156
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,750
Well, isn't it nice to have a chat or two during lunch?

157
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,880
In the first place, there aren't many students in this school.

158
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,620
This isn't the only place where there are few people.

159
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,630
...Yeah.

160
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,600
Ever since the Great Fire five years ago, there just aren't many people left.

161
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,510
According to the media, it was caused by a gas explosion...

162
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,860
But the people of Fuyuki know that that's a lie.

163
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,730
You... Did you witness the fire yourself?

164
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,040
Yeah. It was that pitch black thing that swallowed the city.

165
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,680
What about the moment... that shadow disappeared?

166
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,880
No. I was running for my life, so I didn't see it.

167
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,530
...Is that so.

168
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,900
Hey, you were here, Sakura?

169
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,400
Yup. For a while now.

170
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,720
You should've said something, then.

171
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,860
I didn't want to interrupt you.

172
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,320
You don't need to be that formal.

173
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,080
There's no one here beside us anyway.

174
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,660
I wasn't really being formal.

175
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,420
Hm?

176
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,260
Senpai is just so addictive to watch.

177
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,940
Addictive...?

178
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,080
I love... watching Senpai shoot.

179
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,080
Synchronized with no wasted movement. It's like Senpai is the bow itself.

180
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,650
Just like a bow... huh?

181
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,060
Welcome home, Shirou-san.

182
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,060
I'm back, Miyu.

183
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,660
I made potato stew for dinner.

184
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,060
I cut the ingredients into small portions to fit inside of tomorrow's lunch box.

185
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,280
I also- oh.

186
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,460
Is something the matter?

187
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,040
No. I just thought of how much you've grown.

188
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,110
If that's the case, I think Shirou-san grew more than me.

189
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,880
Haha. You may be right.

190
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,150
How is it?

191
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,650
It's delicious.

192
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,640
You've improved once again.

193
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,950
Thank goodness.

194
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,110
Oh, that's right, Miyu.

195
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,110
What is is, Shirou-san.

196
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,400
I bought a new book for you. I'll give it to you later.

197
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,310
Really? Thank you.

198
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:01,480
Before this you were always reading children's encyclopedia, and now you're even reading professional texts...

199
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,040
Is that... bad?

200
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,770
Its not that it's bad, It's proof that you're learning.

201
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,750
I also won't get funny looks when I borrow the books..

202
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,100
Funny looks?

203
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,570
I can't reveal that I have a little sis, right?

204
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,880
Little sis...

205
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,080
Something wrong?

206
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,880
Huh? I-it's nothing, Shirou-san.

207
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,600
Book title: Picture series - Anatomy Biology

208
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,280
Hey... is that book really alright?

209
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,910
Huh? Aren't all books just like this?

210
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,770
No, I was wondering whether that book is interesting at all or not...

211
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,820
It's for the sake of acquiring knowledge.

212
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,970
Oh... right. I'm going to train for a bit.

213
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,370
Okay, happy training!

214
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,730
I continued to make the same mistakes in my path for Justice.

215
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,840
I always tried to fix what I did wrong, but I only made things worse.

216
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,040
Endlessly repeating... until I couldn't bear it anymore.

217
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,440
I wanted an easy way out, for a miracle to happen.

218
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:23,860
It was like chasing after the clouded moon, a journey in a pitch black night.

219
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,730
You're talking like an old geezer right now, Kiritsugu.

220
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,320
Shirou?

221
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,620
Chasing after what's right could never be a mistake.

222
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,770
I will never let it be a mistake!

223
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:48,080
Yeah, you do that. I can rest easy now

224
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,240
I... don't know what I should do.

225
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,400
Damn it!

226
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,330
I wonder if mom will like it.

227
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,860
Yeah, she'll love it!

228
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,220
Thanks for the food.

229
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,310
Miyu.

230
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,060
Yes?

231
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,400
Here, take this.

232
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,710
This is...

233
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,530
It's a pajama for you.

234
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,310
You've grown out of your old clothes, right?

235
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,330
Is it really okay?

236
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,710
Yeah, it's really noth-

237
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,040
Thank you, Shirou-san.

238
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,910
I'm... really happy.

239
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,970
Trace... on.

240
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,200
Hey, Kiritsugu. The price for fulfilling the wish is...

241
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,530
It's as you've read

242
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:27,060
To fulfill the wish, Miyu's life would be bound to the world...?

243
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,790
To save the world, nothing short of a miracle is required.

244
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,710
A wish of this scale would have a price to pay.

245
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,500
A wish of this scale would have a price to pay.

246
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,470
Don't mistake your goal, Shirou.

247
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,620
It's saving the greater number of lives, not the few lives in front of your eyes.

248
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,040
Kiritsugu never hesitated.

249
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,400
And yet... why am I...?

250
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,820
Thanks for the hard work, Shirou-san.

251
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,760
You're still up?

252
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,080
Yup. I'm looking for constellation signs.

253
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,410
Constellations? I didn't know you were into something this delicate and romantic.

254
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,970
The movement of constellations and stars should not have any meaning beyond Physics.

255
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:17,020
That's why I would like to know the reason why books like these use pictures and illustrations to give special meanings to the arrangement of stars.

256
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,170
Did I let you read too many picture books...?

257
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:20,930
Hm?

258
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,660
Pops loved to look at the stars in this spot too.

259
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,130
Fath... Kiritsugu-san? Why?

260
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,440
I wonder why?

261
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,240
At the time, what did Kiritsugu feel when he was watching the stars?

262
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,710
Miyu's Divine power haven't surfaced in years.

263
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,750
She could have... lost all of her power by now.

264
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,350
Then... if that's the case.

265
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,510
...I wish upon the stars

266
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,040
If I could...

267
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,400
If I could fulfill just one wish...

268
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,970
I want Shirou-san and I to be true brother and sister.

269
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,570
Such a thing... could never happen, right?

270
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,210
...No.

271
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,280
...

272
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,240
How could it not happen?

273
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,330
Alright, Miyu! It's time to study.

274
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,970
Where is this coming from all of a sudden?

275
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,350
Well, I say study, but we'll start with things that are common sense, rather than the typical academic subjects.

276
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,860
Since you're always reading pretty much the same kind of books.

277
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,600
Oh?

278
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,330
Not that I mind, but why now of all times?

279
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,840
Because... I'm planning to take you outside soon.

280
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,310
Out... side...?

281
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:05,620
I know it may be hard to take that in right now, since your "world" has been confined to our home

282
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,770
But now I want to-

283
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,400
I want to see the ocean!

284
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:14,050
I want to see the place where the sky and water meet and I also want to experience the ocean breeze!

285
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,770
and hear the the sound and see the tidal waves!

286
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,300
Roger that.

287
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,570
We gotta earn it by studying, though.

288
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,780
We'll have to learn Traffic Laws, Ethics and more.

289
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,060
I'll learn it all right away.

290
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,040
Leave it to me, Shioru-sa-

291
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,640
No...

292
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,690
Onii-chan!

293
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,370
This place is nostalgic. I bet if Miyu went here, she could be with kids her age.

294
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,760
A kid?

295
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,330
What are you doing, Senpai?

296
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,760
Is there something going on with the elementary school?

297
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,600
No... It's nothing.

298
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:05,300
Ah, could it be, Senpai, that you like younger girls?

299
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,160
Huh?

300
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:10,930
If that's the case, I'm both an underclassman and a younger sister.

301
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,650
Younger sister? You had siblings, Sakura?

302
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,000
Yes. An older brother.

303
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,170
I see. I didn't know.

304
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,220
Senpai, can you tell what I'm thinking of right now?

305
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,770
Huh? Morning club activities?

306
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,250
Wrong

307
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,580
I was thinking... That this right now is the happiest time of my life.

308
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,580
Happiest time?

309
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,340
Yup.

310
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,560
You may be mean to me sometimes, but you're nice too...

311
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,720
And I still go to school even if there aren't many students...

312
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,450
I get to study, and be in a club...

313
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,840
I think that being able to live mundane days like this... is what you call happiness.

314
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,530
Well, I guess that sounds corny, though.

315
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,650
No, it doesn't.

316
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,650
Eh?

317
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,490
I... think so too.

318
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,120
Wipe that stupid grin off your face.

319
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,740
Eh?

320
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,300
Sakura brought that up earlier too.

321
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,540
Something about how I look different from usual.

322
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,800
Your face looks more revolting than it normally does. What are you even happy about?

323
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,050
Hmmm... I saw this little girl behind the elementary school this morning.

324
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,370
I was looking at her from pretty far away, but I could tell she was cute...

325
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,600
Okay, hold up. You're thinking something totally off.

326
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,080
I was just wondering if she could be friends with my little sister!

327
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,650
I wasn't thinking anything weird.

328
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,040
Your sister?

329
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,040
I didn't know you had one.

330
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Oh... yeah...

331
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,840
Her name is Miyu.

332
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,170
She's a good and smart kid.

333
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,830
Miyu...

334
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,100
Where was that kid I saw this morning from, though?

335
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,940
She had this blond hair that was tied up into a ringlet ponytail and gave off a foreign rich girl sorta vibe.

336
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,980
What are you doing?

337
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,580
Doesn't that burn?

338
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,020
Hell no, it doesn't.

339
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,360
What are you acting tough for?!

340
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,240
So, what you're saying is...

341
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,860
You've been smirking to yourself while thinking of your sister.

342
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,540
I don't like the way you phrased that...

343
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:32,760
Both you and Sakura are making too big a deal over me just smiling.

344
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,260
Let me tell you something.

345
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,750
I don't mind lies.

346
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:44,120
That said, "Fakes" that put on an act for no reason at all make me want to vomit.

347
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,600
Until now, that's what all your smiling was.

348
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,780
Your stupid grin today is indeed disgusting....

349
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,260
But since it's not an empty one, It's a thousand time better than that act.

350
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,260
I had no idea.

351
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,030
I feel bad for you.

352
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,620
Fakes just don't know how phony they really-

353
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,160
You get a lot more talkative when you put on sweatpants, huh?

354
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,570
Are you picking a fight, punk?

355
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,820
Alrighty then, I've decided.

356
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,000
I'll start making lunch for you too, starting tomorrow.

357
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,190
Huh? What does that have to do with anything?

358
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,280
Step screwing around.

359
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,810
Onii-chan. I'm ready.

360
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,060
Yeah, I'm coming right away.

361
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,080
It's finally time.

362
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,370
Are you scared?

363
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,230
Scared? Why would I be?

364
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,010
Because it's your-

365
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,640
Onii-chan, are we getting closer to the ocean?

366
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,840
We'll save that for later.

367
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,670
Later?

368
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,690
I've already long since decided on our first stop.

369
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,640
What are these?

370
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,360
They're...

371
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,460
Your real family's graves.

372
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:28,590
Do you remember? This is where you and I first met.

373
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,590
It's also your home where you were born.

374
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,700
My home? My mother's... everyone's graves?

375
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,000
It's strange... No matter how hard I try

376
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,760
I just can't seem to remember Much of anything.

377
00:27:52,690 --> 00:28:00,110
But... I can still recall the warmth of my mother's hand.

378
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:08,100
I see. So, back then, I was left all alone.

379
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:15,710
I was alone, but then Kiritsugu-san and Onii-chan came and rescued me.

380
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,420
I have to tell her.

381
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,370
I'll tell her, and we'll start all over.

382
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,820
This time as a family!

383
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,350
No, Miyu. At the time, Kiritsugu and I...

384
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,230
didn't really save you.

385
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:37,850
Eh?

386
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,160
Why we came to this place... and why we later took you in...

387
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,550
wasn't for your sake.

388
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,620
Onii-chan... what are you saying...?

389
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,170
It was because...

390
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:56,570
we wanted to... use you as a tool to invoke a miracle.

391
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,770
To invoke a miracle... a tool...?

392
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,930
But Miyu, now I just-

393
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,180
That's boring..

394
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,140
Damn, that's boring.

395
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:16,970
That's the most boring development ever, you bastards.

396
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:25,370
So you were the one, Emiya Shirou!

397
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,120
Julian...!?

398
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,250
Why are you here?

399
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,920
That's the one without a doubt, right, Erika?

400
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,620
...Yup. Most of the characteristics are probably gone.

401
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,240
But... The Container is intact.

402
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,720
I've always monitored the area.

403
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,560
If someone intentionally enters

404
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,920
They either must be from The Sakatsuki family members that left

405
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,860
Or a thief.

406
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,940
What are you... talking about...?

407
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,300
Five years ago... The attack that swallowed the town

408
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:10,220
The pillar of light that removed it was activated from this very place.

409
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,520
I've been searching for it for so long

410
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,170
For the miracle of this world, and

411
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,700
The thief who stole it.

412
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,960
RUN, MIYU!!!

413
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,160
I'll handle him!

414
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,250
Run...? Where...?

415
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,680
What is that, Strengthening Magecraft?

416
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,320
Are you going to kill me with something like that?

417
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,720
Stop, Julian... Your hand...!

418
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,610
Why...

419
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,100
is that bastard someone like you...!

420
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,160
Fall.

421
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,720
Huh...?

422
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,980
Onii-chan!?

423
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,040
I've been looking for you for a long time.

424
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,860
The only true miracle that remains in this world.

425
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Sakatsuki Miyu, from now on

426
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,140
you're something that belongs to me.

427
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,290
S-Stop it... Julian...!!

428
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:16,090
There will be no accident this time. It will probably be enough with just this Container.

429
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,090
...What are you talking about?

430
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,020
Although most of the city has been destroyed, a repeat of the ritual will never be any better than this

431
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,130
It must succeed this time.

432
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:29,320
You... Just what are you talking about, Julian!?

433
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,930
What's with that tone of your voice...

434
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,360
It's just like...

435
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,400
It's like...

436
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,210
You were the cause of that shadow!?

437
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,190
That's right.

438
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,120
I did it.

439
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,180
JULIAN!!

440
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,320
Are you injured, Julian-sama?

441
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,660
Like that would happen.

442
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,200
Take her and restart everything.

443
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,220
What about that man?

444
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,610
...Leave him be.

445
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,440
He's already worthless.

446
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,620
Ju...lian...

447
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,150
...You're finally awake?

448
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,110
...Dad...?

449
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,460
...I regret to tell you this, but I'm not your father.

450
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,280
This place...

451
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,950
It's better if you don't move recklessly.

452
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,830
It's been a long time since I've healed someone. I can't guarantee the results.

453
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:09,500
Who are you? You... rescued me?

454
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,420
Helping a drowning person is the extent of something I would still do.

455
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,980
I'm still a priest, after all.

456
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,860
A priest...?

457
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,480
Welcome to the Holy Church of Fuyuki.

458
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:34,160
I'm a priest that is responsible for witnessing the end of this world. Welcome, lost lamb.

459
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,730
I'm thankful you saved me, but...

460
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:42,170
I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry. I'll have to thank you at a later time.

461
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:50,480
Where are you going? You don't even know where Sakatsuki Miyu has been taken.

462
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,980
...Don't tell me. You also...

463
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,330
Not only rash, but also wrong.

464
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:07,250
Lost child, what you need to do now is understand what is happening first.

465
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,170
Observe

466
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,820
Analyze

467
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,130
And act.

468
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:19,620
If you don't, you'll make the same mistake again.

469
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,060
Who are you? How do you know about Miyu?

470
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:29,600
No need to be alarmed, I'm only someone who monitors and observes.

471
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,970
I don't intend any harm to her.

472
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,690
Like I'd believ-

473
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,690
Don't be mistaken, boy.

474
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:42,200
What you should know now is, the identity of the people who kidnapped Sakatsuki Miyu and their goals.

475
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,550
And not suspect an observer on the sidelines who never interfered.

476
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,610
Please tell me... their goal and true identity.

477
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,350
Ainsworth.

478
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,390
They are famous as a magus family that continues their thousand-year journey.

479
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,620
But their only magic specialty is basic "Displacement Magecraft" trash.

480
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,690
Ainsworth...?

481
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,800
They have always embraced the same wish for a thousand of years.

482
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,510
An overly grand, overly childish and overly idealistic wish.

483
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,080
Do you know what that is?

484
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,720
Why would I know something like that?

485
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,100
If it's you, you should be able to understand it.

486
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,380
It can't be...

487
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,500
The continuation of humanity's history.

488
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:41,730
without caring about the method, saving the doomed humanity is the wish of the Ainsworth.

489
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,350
They captured Sakatsuki Miyu to wish for humanity's salvation.

490
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:50,220
Is that not justice?

491
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,040
The same justice... dad wanted...

492
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:04,880
It was 200 years ago when the Ainsworth sought after the Holy Grail that surpasses the human method and created the ritual.

493
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,730
There have already been four instances of that ritual, the Holy Grail Wars, but all have ended in failure.

494
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:14,000
Holy Grail Wars?

495
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,280
A ritual of slaughter, and the winner obtains the Holy Grail.

496
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:24,570
The fourth war had the worst ending possible, five years ago. You witnessed it yourself, right?

497
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,450
In this war, the previous head of the Ainsworth,

498
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:35,080
alongside the others who helped him, were completely destroyed and Julian was the only survivor.

499
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:44,170
However, Julian is planning on restarting the ritual himself by using Sakatsuki Miyu as the Holy Grail for the fifth war

500
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,460
All for the sake of saving humanity.

501
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,570
Don't fuck with me! What do you mean it's for the sake of humanity!!

502
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:56,220
He caused that massive crater! How many people do you think were sacrificed for that ritual?

503
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,220
"Saving humanity"?... In the end, all it caused was tragedy!!

504
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,000
"In the end", huh. Don't jump to conclusions so quickly.

505
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,540
The human race is destined for ruin.

506
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:14,910
What the Ainsworths saw was the horizon beyond the future.

507
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,670
Not branches, but the tree trunks.

508
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,090
Not trees, but the forest.

509
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,520
Not individuals, but the community.

510
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:24,570
To abandon and sacrifice the minority and fulfill your duty

511
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,000
Are you going to reject that?

512
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
That's...

513
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,370
Then, make your choice, Emiya Shirou.

514
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,260
To observe, or to oppose.

515
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:41,130
No matter which choice you make, the justice you're shouldering will crumble into pieces.

516
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:51,110
At any rate, I need to meet with Julian again and verify of all this.

517
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,930
Ainsworth's atelier is in the center of the crater.

518
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,640
However, as you are now...

519
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,880
That can't be...

520
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,720
...I see.

521
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,350
You won't even allow meeting... the fake who only admired justice?

522
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,570
GET OUT HERE, JULIAN!

523
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,570
I KNOW YOU'RE THERE!!

524
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,220
I admit it!!! I'm a form of justice, a form of family

525
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,950
A form of human only imitating these things to cover myself, an empty shell...!!

526
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,970
I was wrong from the start...

527
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,300
Even I know that...!

528
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,100
But... That's why I...

529
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,420
Wanted to start being something real...!!

530
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,840
I still have something... that I didn't manage to tell her yet

531
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,570
Give Miyu...

532
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,100
Give my sister back to me...

533
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,600
After that day, Julian stopped appearing.

534
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,350
I made the wrong choice.

535
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,000
Even so, time still marches on cruelly.

536
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,980
No effect... huh.

537
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:41,600
That fake of a priest, even making me pay so much money for these black keys...

538
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,570
Senpai?

539
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,420
Sakura...

540
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,100
Why are you here...?

541
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,700
I was on my way home after buying groceries. What a coincidence.

542
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,650
Senpai?

543
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,100
No... it's nothing.

544
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,470
Wow, it looks delicious...!

545
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,690
I knew Senpai was awesome!

546
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,760
Even housewives would feel ashamed after seeing Senpai's cooking.

547
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,980
It's nothing special.

548
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,660
I never thought I'd get to have such a feast in Senpai's home...

549
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,400
Thansk for the food.

550
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,120
I'm sorry, I'm not around school nowadays...

551
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,820
No, don't say that.

552
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:54,500
Although, I got really worried about you, I'm just glad you're not sick.

553
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,720
It's just...

554
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,500
Pulling bows alone... Walking home alone...

555
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,520
It felt so lonely...

556
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,370
I'm so thankful for today.

557
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:13,550
Senpai's cooking was really delicious.

558
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,540
Sorry... I probably won't come to school for a while.

559
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,280
If you're okay with it, you can visit my home again.

560
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,180
...Although I'm happy about this invitation

561
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,480
This is the last time.

562
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:34,520
You don't need to be shy. I don't really mind-

563
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,520
It's the last time!

564
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,860
I also... Actually, I really want to be with Senpai more

565
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,650
Going to school... Attending activities...

566
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,440
Walking home together... Saying "See you tomorrow"...

567
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:55,300
It's just that... I treasured those small things...

568
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,270
Sakura...

569
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,170
But even that has to end

570
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,420
Because the Holy Grail War has begun.

571
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,770
What are you... saying...?

572
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,300
Sakura... Why do you...

573
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,170
know about that term...?

574
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,600
Of course I know about it.

575
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,600
The Matou are one of the families that helped create that ritual.

576
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,420
YOU WERE DECEIV-

577
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,450
...That's unfortunate. I thought you'd be more flustered.

578
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,610
...How should I put it?

579
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,490
I think I've gotten used to losing everything

580
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:45,320
A "loss". So that's how you look at it, huh?

581
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,220
Hey, Sakura.

582
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,180
Did you come to finish me off?

583
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,070
I knew it. Senpai is such a bully..

584
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:05,050
The Holy Grail War principally uses these Servant cards, Heroic Spirits, to fight as basis for the ritual.

585
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,730
The Heroic Spirit of this card is the King of Heroes, Gilgamesh.

586
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,720
This is the strongest card, without a doubt.

587
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,900
This card...

588
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,980
I'll let Senpai have it.

589
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,040
...But why?

590
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:25,270
If you want to rescue Miyu-chan, you'll have to become the winner of the Holy Grail War.

591
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:29,100
With this card, it may no longer be impossible.

592
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,160
But...

593
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,170
Sakura...?

594
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,900
There is one thing... If it's possible...

595
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,400
If it can be granted...

596
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,480
Please run away instead!

597
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:50,810
Whether it's magic or Miyu-chan, forget all of that and run away from this town!

598
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:56,430
If Senpai... If Senpai would do that...

599
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,910
I would give up everything together with you...!

600
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,950
Sakura.

601
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,400
I'm sorry, I-

602
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,750
SAKURA!

603
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,870
Slutty. You're too slutty.

604
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,450
Who are you!?

605
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:30,150
Oh man, oh man, oh man... You're such a slutty sister, Sakura.

606
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:36,650
Let your brother co... co... correct?... correct you as necessary.

607
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,720
B... Brother...

608
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,060
Brother...!?

609
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:44,070
You're Sakura's brother? Then why are you...

610
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:51,350
That 's right. I'm the legitimate successor of the Matou family. My name is Matou...

611
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,750
......What was it again...?

612
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:59,920
Oh well. If I kill those two, who knows? I might remember something.

613
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,150
Trace on!

614
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,850
Senpai!

615
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,800
Huh? Hey hey, what was that about? This is strange...

616
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,270
WHY WAS MY ATTACK BLOCKED!!!???

617
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:18,420
Why? Why? Why WHY? Why did you block my attack?

618
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,320
WHY DID YOU BLOCK IT!!!???

619
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,590
This way, Sakura!

620
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:46,870
Be careful, Senpai. That Heroic Spirit is...

621
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,600
Sakura! Your wound!

622
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,820
I-It's alright. More importantly-

623
00:45:54,530 --> 00:46:00,720
And here I am, taking grand action for humanity's sake and ideals.

624
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,070
But you just keep getting in my way...

625
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,380
I'll kill you after I'm done with her.

626
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,690
SO WAIT YOUR TURN!

627
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,440
Senpai!

628
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,210
Run away, Sakura...!

629
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,250
I can't...

630
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,150
Throw... everything... away...

631
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,950
Don't worry about me!

632
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,920
Escape by yourself...

633
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,750
and find happiness away from here...!

634
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,310
Saku...ra?

635
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,730
I'll... defeat you, brother!

636
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,310
Heeh?

637
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,790
You grew a backbone, Sakura!?

638
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,190
On top of opposing your brother, you're going to "defeat me"?

639
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:48,190
Did that what's-his-name over there seduce you or something?

640
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:53,120
What a horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE LITTLE SISTER YOU ARE!

641
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:57,970
With a sister like you, I guess I have no choice

642
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,320
But to kill you...!!

643
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,780
D-don't do it, Sakura! For siblings to kill each other...

644
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,570
It's okay.

645
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:13,630
My brother has been dead for a long time.

646
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,080
Also...

647
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:19,140
You didn't choose me

648
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:24,700
But... I love you, so I'll protect you.

649
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,700
Sakura...!!

650
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,650
It'll be fine. Since I have this card, I'll win for sure!

651
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,750
INSTALL!

652
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,960
What's wrong, Sakura!?

653
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,760
Don't tell me you can't even install!?

654
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,880
It can't be... Why...!?

655
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:03,450
We already knew you might betray us!

656
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:08,750
Did you really think Julian-sama would give you the Gilgamesh card!?

657
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,570
It isn't connected to a Heroic Spirit.

658
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:17,890
It's a genuine garbage card through and through!

659
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,450
Garbage... card...?

660
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:27,840
Oh boy. It seems your brother has to teach you how to use the cards.

661
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,070
RUN SAKURA!!!

662
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,160
Sen... pai...

663
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,950
Dead Heartbeat Melody

664
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,950
ZABANIYA!

665
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,150
I'm Sorry...

666
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,650
...Huh?

667
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:56,950
Huh huh? huh?

668
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:59,950
What did I do...?

669
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:02,950
Where did Sakura go...?

670
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:09,470
Maybe... Yeah,  yeah now I remember.

671
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:15,050
I sEeEeEeEEeeeE! I KilLeEEeEeeEd HeR!!!!

672
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,350
Why...

673
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:31,020
You see, I'll have to kill lots of people in this war

674
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,230
And I want them to suffer as much as possible...

675
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,070
LET ME PRACTICE WITH YOU!

676
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,180
Yeah...

677
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:45,570
I've lost...

678
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:48,640
and lost...

679
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,780
and lost...

680
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,760
And I'm the only thing that remained behind...

681
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,520
You're still alive?

682
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,490
I have a better grasp on using Assassin now.                 Can I kill you already?

683
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,960
I'll even listen to your last words.

684
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,140
I bet it'll be the same as Sakura, right?

685
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,320
Hey...

686
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,540
Hah...?

687
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,160
Tell... me...

688
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,170
How...

689
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:30,500
did it feel...

690
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,850
to murder your own sister?

691
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,960
BETTER THAN EJACULATING A HUNDRED TIMES!

692
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,940
YOU SHOULD TRY IT YOURSELF!

693
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:50,380
Farewell. It was fun. Err... What was your name again?

694
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,300
There's no moon.

695
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,300
Miracle

696
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,480
Hope

697
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,480
There are no stars...

698
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:58,290
Oh yeah, I remembered.

699
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,000
Well then, once again...

700
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:03,690
The path... is dissolving in Darkness...

701
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,760
Goodbye... Emiya.

702
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,320
However... still...

703
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,130
My body remains!

704
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,020
ARM!

705
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,450
MY... AAAAARM!!!

706
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,480
What the hell are you!?

707
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,730
Sakura's card was undeniably a garbage card.

708
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,130
This is weird... Installing it should be impossible!

709
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,730
What the hell!?

710
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,180
WHO THE HELL IS THAT HEROIC SPIRIT!?

711
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,180
CARD

712
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,400
What the hell!? What the hell!!?

713
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,160
WHAT THE HELL!!!???

714
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,220
STAY AWAY!

715
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,240
Don't get confident!

716
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,020
My arm still moves even if you cut it off-

717
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,380
I never heard about this!

718
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,730
Hey. What's with that attitude...?

719
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,960
Hey, hey. Don't tell me just because of that...

720
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,060
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me...

721
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,410
YOU THINK YOU'RE STRONGER THAN ME...?

722
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,460
I'd say you are...

723
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,160
Not suited to be an Assassin.

724
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,920
Even you... you're...

725
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,350
MAKING FUN OF ME!!!!!

726
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,700
Projection Start

727
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,700
Trace on!

728
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,820
What's that... IT BarELy itcHEEeeeS!

729
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:28,700
i'm ThE strOnGeS! I'M thE sTRongEST!!!

730
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:39,880
That's far...

731
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,680
from the strongest.

732
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,140
yoUUUU bAASTaaaARd!!!!!!!

733
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,580
BURST!

734
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:08,890
You're still barking...

735
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,850
If that's the case...

736
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,650
I'll blow you away

737
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,540
until there's nothing left.

738
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:30,410
I love... watching Senpai... shoot.

739
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,640
Sakura...

740
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,680
Thank you.

741
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,880
H... Ho.... How did you...!?

742
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:03,370
Why did you notice...!?

743
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,570
You told me yourself.

744
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:10,650
"My arm still moves even if you cut it off".

745
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,850
Midway through the fight, that monster became an empty decoy.

746
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,760
N-no... I don't wanna die...

747
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,230
I don't wanna die.

748
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,940
Sakura thought the same.

749
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,990
I'M NOT STUPID, I KNOW THAT!

750
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,550
NO ONE IN THE WORLD WANTS TO DIE!

751
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,740
THAT'S WHY JULIAN-SAMA...!

752
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:47,240
...

753
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:52,460
I've... finally...

754
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,890
remembered everything.

755
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,540
FUCK "JULIAN-SAMA"! SHIT! SHIT!

756
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,030
I was already gone long ago...

757
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:14,270
...I've had enough

758
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:17,710
Kill me... Emiya.

759
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,380
Where...

760
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,760
Hmm?

761
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,690
What... is this?

762
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,710
Oh? This is strange.

763
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:59,440
I'm surprised that you walked over here, I thought you would run away as soon as you woke.

764
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:02,330
Run? What's the point?

765
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,800
Oh?

766
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:11,760
From the very start... at that house... and in this place, I was always intended to be a tool, wasn't I?

767
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:15,730
Hahahahaha, what wonderful resignation!

768
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:19,840
That's it... That's... it...

769
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:26,180
Though it's slowly coming together, it's still not enough...

770
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:33,120
I agree as well. You are already a part of the Ainsworths.

771
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,340
There's nothing else you can do but to surrender your fate.

772
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,220
The conclusion of the legend is already set. Stop thinking about unnecessary things.

773
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:48,600
This is the sole happiness you can get as a tool, and not a person

774
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,130
Remember this feeling.

775
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:02,370
From now on you're gonna kill lots of people, right?

776
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,590
I'll... pass.

777
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:12,780
I'll go ahead and wait for you in hell.

778
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:16,800
A doll...?

779
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,700
My brother has been dead for a long time.

780
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,580
This is "Displacement Magecraft".

781
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,470
Hell, huh?

782
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,720
I... won't be going there just yet.

783
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,350
Install.

784
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,240
The people precious to me are gone.

785
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:03,500
I threw away my pride.

786
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:10,160
I threw even my bare self. And in the process, I became empty.

787
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,720
I-Impossible...!

788
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:33,100
After losing everything, my goals became clear.

789
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:48,080
I have to win...

790
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,160
I... I...

791
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,850
have to take back...

792
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:25,970
Who... in the hell...

793
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:28,520
Who... in the hell... is that... Heroic Spirit...?

794
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,990
EMIYA.

795
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,040
Heroic Spirit... Emiya?

796
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:41,600
Well, well.

797
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:49,610
Ah. You look so beautiful today, just like an inorganic matter

798
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:06,880
I see, I see. Emiya

799
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,850
If I'm remembering correctly, this is the form of your future self?

800
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,610
No answer, huh?

801
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,760
Fervor, mei sanguis.

802
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,760
Boil, my blood

803
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,400
Scalp

804
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,400
Slash

805
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:30,100
Hmph. I've heard that there's no concept of time in the Throne of Heroes.

806
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,930
I suppose this is also possible.

807
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:35,720
Scalp

808
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:35,720
Slash

809
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,190
Such a weapon will never reach me.

810
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,920
I told you it's no use.

811
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,120
Wh...at...? This... power...

812
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:57,390
What... are you...?

813
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,360
Alaya

814
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,360
Someone who made a pact with the World.

815
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,580
A Guardian of Humanity.

816
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:09,800
Yes, the power of the Guardian...

817
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,430
Meant for Humanity's sake...

818
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,570
With it, I will...

819
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:19,120
With such power, I will...

820
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,190
EXCALIBUR !

821
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,190
Sword of Promised Victory

822
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,970
Fine by me...

823
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:02,800
We've gone this far, so I'll keep playing your game...

824
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,020
UNTIL ONE OF US BREAKS!

825
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,400
I'll leave Julian... to you...

826
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,840
Splendid, Emiya Shirou.

827
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:34,800
You have defeated all of your opponents and collected all seven cards.

828
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:40,090
For this Holy Grail War... victory is yours.

829
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,690
Kotomine.

830
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:47,850
Even if you would execute your friend's father to get here.

831
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:51,560
Hold your head high, boy.

832
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:57,120
You've opened what was meant to be a dead end with your own two hands.

833
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:01,220
With these seven cards, go and see your sister.

834
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:03,660
Where is Miyu?

835
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:09,880
In order to summon the Holy Grail, she must be at that place.

836
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:17,770
Miunt Enzo, a place a dragon once welled. Deep within it lies a vast underground cavern.

837
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,230
That place... is where your fate awaits.

838
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:38,240
It's been a terribly long time.

839
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,700
How are you doing

840
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,840
Julian?

841
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:49,090
Give Miyu back.

842
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,940
That... would be betraying mankind.

843
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:04,650
In her lies a method of of saving the human race from this planet full of tragedies and certain doom.

844
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:11,310
To throw it all away for that petty goddamned sentimentality of yours.

845
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:18,010
I can't even laugh at it. I really can't. Doing something like that...

846
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,240
MAKES YOU THE WORST KIND OF EVIL.

847
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:25,050
I see. So that's how it was.

848
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:30,330
You too, were fighting alone this entire time.

849
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,970
Don't act like you understand...!

850
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,300
But I do.

851
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,580
Kill one to save the many.

852
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,840
I knew someone like that.

853
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,140
Yes. But even so...

854
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:53,230
Even so, I'll...

855
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,390
I'm sorry, Kiritsugu...

856
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:01,450
Even if it's a mistake...

857
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:04,650
I'll... walk this path instead.

858
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:08,480
Julian...

859
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,480
You're like another possibility of mine.

860
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,840
A me who chose a different path.

861
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:23,920
Did you know, about Miyu's family... About The Sakatsuki family.

862
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:32,650
The kept records from the first generation down to Miyu's.

863
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:43,550
The Children of God who can grant any wish, what would the family who controls all of that power wish for, do you know?

864
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:55,760
They simply wished for their children to grow up healthy.

865
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,690
They could've wished for wealth and prosperity

866
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:04,600
But all they ever asked for was what any parent would've wanted for their children

867
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:09,000
And not a single exception over four hundred years.

868
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,440
If that is considered evil...

869
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,120
Then I'll be evil.

870
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:16,590
O... Nii-...chan...?

871
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:22,620
Sorry, for making you wait so long...

872
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,810
Why... did you come?

873
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,110
Back then, Onii-chan said it himself...

874
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:36,620
That the reason you and Kiritsugu-san took me in...

875
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:39,150
Was to use my... power...

876
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:43,600
That I am... just a tool.

877
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,450
So then why...

878
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:47,480
Did you come here...1?

879
01:08:53,000 --> 01:09:00,340
I'll continue... telling you what I really wanted you to know, but couldn't.

880
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,460
It goes without saying.

881
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,380
It's because I'm an older brother.

882
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:24,680
So I have to protect my younger sister, don't I?

883
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:39,350
It's been one mistake after another with me, so this might be one too.

884
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:44,750
But, for this alone is true,

885
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,520
I wish upon the Holy Grail.

886
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:55,500
I pray you find a world where you won't have to suffer any longer.

887
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:59,080
I pray that you meet kind people.

888
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,840
I pray that you find friends you can laugh with.

889
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:05,680
I pray you find... a warm, small...

890
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,940
Share of happiness.

891
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:55,710
O...Onii-...cha...

892
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:29,880
Sorry,

893
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:35,800
But my little sister is working her hardest right now.

894
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,650
Could you wait just a little longer?

895
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,540
I cannot...

896
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:45,420
Your wish will not be granted.

897
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:52,740
A Faker who slipped into the Holy Grail War

898
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:54,680
shall not seize the miracle...!

899
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:05,900
So that's the true Archer card... Gilgamesh, huh?

900
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:15,040
With no card, for a mere flesh and blood human, to stand against the King of Heroes, is the epitome of foolishness.

901
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:23,020
Be it western or eastern, ancient or modern, all of humanity's treasures are this Heroic Spirit's power.

902
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:30,330
I see... So that's why Sakura called it the "Strongest Card".

903
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,470
You...

904
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,110
Humanity... Humanity, huh?

905
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:42,150
That's big, bigger than words to express.

906
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:48,570
It must be an enormous burden you guys are carrying.

907
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,840
But you know...

908
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,710
I've got someone I'm responsible for too.

909
01:12:55,710 --> 01:13:00,060
Be it personal feelings, or be it sentimentality,

910
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:05,060
Both are completely worthless in this World.

911
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:08,330
Trace.. On!

912
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:14,660
"Trace"...!? It can't be.

913
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:17,000
That fighting style...!

914
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:25,000
Possessed by the embodiment of that heroic ideal, a future different path,

915
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:31,660
Having faced many battles, I perfected my future skills and Magic Circuits,

916
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:34,310
And even inherited his Origin.

917
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:38,910
No... It might be better to say...

918
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,270
Every time this body fought,

919
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:43,460
it was being invaded by Heroic Spirit EMIYA!

920
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:48,110
What was that about a Mere flesh and blood human?

921
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:50,640
You're slow on the uptake, King of Heroes.

922
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,370
What you're facing

923
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:53,820
is a true imitation

924
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:55,820
of a Heroic Spirit!!

925
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:57,920
Lowly Faker!

926
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:33,400
...Your body should be at the point of no return, yet the speed and strength of your projection is increasing.

927
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:38,820
I do not know what trick you are using, but it's useless.

928
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:41,150
The only thing that awaits you...

929
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:43,550
is certain ruin.

930
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,620
...I know.

931
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:51,170
The reason I was able to survive those battles...

932
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:54,590
What you labeled as "useless",

933
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:56,710
is my connection with her.

934
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:02,060
I lasted until now because of Miyu's support.

935
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:02,060
Magical Energy

936
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,600
I'm such a pathetic big brother, aren't I?

937
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:09,880
But, that's precisely why...

938
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,650
I'm standing here and now

939
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:16,880
to use up what's left of my life!!!

940
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,200
My body is made of swords.

941
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,200
———I am the bone of my sword.

942
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,480
Steel is my body and fire is my blood.

943
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,480
My blood is of iron. And my heart is of glass.

944
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:37,430
I have created over a thousand blades.

945
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:37,430
I have overcame countless battlefields.

946
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:40,280
Never once retreating.

947
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:40,280
Unaware of beginning

948
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,000
Nor once attaining victory.

949
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,000
nor aware of end.

950
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:45,660
The orphan is alone again,

951
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:45,660
Withstood pain with inconsistent weapons.

952
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:48,910
Striking diamond dust on a hill of swords.

953
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:48,910
My hands will never hold anything.

954
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,200
But,

955
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,200
—————Yet,

956
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,660
This life is not yet over.

957
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,660
my flame never ends.

958
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,480
My whole body was

959
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,480
This fallen body was still

960
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:00,350
"Unlimited Blade Works"

961
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:00,350
Still made of swords——!!

962
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:11,440
This world...

963
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,080
Fantasy and reality,

964
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:19,780
Inside and outside, overwriting the world with one's own mind.

965
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:28,110
The Innermost Magecraft, Reality Marble.

966
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:30,140
Hey...

967
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:32,790
What do you think of it?

968
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:37,060
It's a world encompassing an infinite number of swords.

969
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:42,130
But to me... they're more like graves.

970
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:47,420
Sorry, but please keep me company

971
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:50,710
Until my blades run out.

972
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:50,710
Until my body gives out.

973
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:54,870
As you wish, a puppet like you who mimics the dead, I shall sink to the bottom of those graves.

974
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,330
He was a step ahead of me?

975
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:21,310
Too slow!

976
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:29,870
Don't make light...

977
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:31,330
of The Ainsworth.

978
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:35,420
Spacial Displacement!

979
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:38,750
Playtime is over.

980
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:43,330
Come forth,

981
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:43,330
Ig-Alima!

982
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:43,330
Mountain Felling Sword

983
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,330
Sul-sagana!

984
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,330
Reduce to Ashes

985
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:26,800
Your very existence is flawed.

986
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:33,980
To the last legend we have written and put into motion for humanity,

987
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:36,410
you may prove to be a hindrance.

988
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:45,930
Your irksome ability, your strange use of Magecraft, and your abhorrent self-destructive conviction...

989
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,820
They will all be torn to pieces

990
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:02,280
Along with your world.

991
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:07,220
Yeah...

992
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:11,610
There's no sword in this world that could stand equal to this sword.

993
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,330
So...

994
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:17,240
while it may be a bit rude,

995
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,240
I'll have to pay you back...

996
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:24,110
WITH ALL THE SWORDS I HAVE IN STOCK!!

997
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:26,440
Return to the beginning——

998
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,820
ENUMA ELISH!!!

999
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,820
The Star of Creation that Split Heaven and Earth

1000
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:40,620
It's futile, even if you pile all of your blades together,

1001
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,990
THEY ARE NO MATCH FOR THE GREATEST SWORD!

1002
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:53,710
Yeah... you got that right.

1003
01:19:55,950 --> 01:20:00,220
There are times when just one thing can outweigh everything else.

1004
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:07,490
Ah, this is bad...

1005
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:12,700
I wonder if she'll be mad at me... for forgetting about our promise to see the ocean.

1006
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:24,770
I... failed to be a hero who could save others....

1007
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:42,310
But...

1008
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:49,550
I won...

1009
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:51,230
Kiritsugu...

1010
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:45,310
So, we decided we're raking a break from you two.

1011
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:47,040
Hold on a sec-

1012
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:47,040
Wait right there-

1013
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,860
Good grief, Luvia-sama is such a handful...

1014
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:07,960
Even though we were in the middle of the mission of collecting the cards.

1015
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,580
Cards?

1016
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:15,910
What you were saying...tell me more about it.

1017
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:19,020
Sapphire! Sapphire!

1018
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:24,880
Geez, if someone discovered that this happened, what would we do?

1019
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:33,000
To have a "Share of happiness" was Onii-chan's wish that I received

1020
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:38,330
But, the current me doesn't have anything...

1021
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:42,790
Nor anything I used to have, so...

1022
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:50,250
What everyone has for granted, their life necessities. I'll start by acquiring those.

1023
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:57,510
Sapphire! Where are yo-

1024
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,330
Y-You're...?

1025
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,310
I'll handle collecting the cards.

1026
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:11,350
So, in return, give me a place to live, give me food, give me clothes,

1027
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,460
Give me

1028
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:14,970
a place to belong.

1029
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:19,840
Magecraft may have no effect, but bundles of pure mana should do it!

1030
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,620
It brushed me! I-It just brushed past me!

1031
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:23,640
Do your best!

1032
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:25,510
This is...?

1033
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:29,820
Hmph, don't mind them. It's just a show of failure.

1034
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,220
Just do what you need to do.

1035
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,860
Understood.

1036
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,310
The Ainsworth's cards'.

1037
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:42,520
I have... to retrieve all of them.

1038
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:45,710
Class card: Lancer.

1039
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:46,930
Include.

1040
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:58,710
Gáe Bolg!

1041
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:58,710
Barbed Spear that Pierces with Death

1042
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:12,550
Lancer: Un-include. Retrieved Class card successfully.

1043
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:17,950
Rider.  Collecting complete.

1044
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:24,240
W-Who... Who is this...?

1045
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:28,730
You'll be fine, Miyu.

1046
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:30,860
Knowing you,

1047
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:36,200
You'll make friends in no time.

1048
