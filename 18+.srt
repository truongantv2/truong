4
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:30,310
<i>I feel alone.</i>

7
00:00:37,598 --> 00:00:39,119

on June 1, 1990,</i>

24
00:03:48,148 --> 00:03:49,830
<i>the day I turned 13.</i>

25

<i>24 diaries filled
with my poor existence,</i>

26
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:56,076
<i>told without
the flair of a great writer.</i>

27
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:58,599
<i>For I have no style,</i>

28
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,281
<i>or only one you could call zilch.</i>

29
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,125
<i>I'd caress your blank pages,</i>

30
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:09,289
<i>hoping to soon tell you
I'd met someone who really loved me,</i>

31

32

<i>A new diary, a new beginning.</i>

33
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:16,176
<i>The beginning of my new life...</i>

34
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:20,581
<i>That's what I wanted to write
on your first page.</i>

35
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,585
<i>But it's been three days
since I've written...</i>

36
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:27,868
<i>I've been dead.</i>

"Snowflake Hotel".

39
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:36,697
Last week it was -36�C.

40
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:38,138
This is...

41
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:40,821
The coldest town in France.
"Little Siberia".

42
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:43,463
You know the place?

43
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:44,905
I came here as a kid.

44
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:48,789
Luckily, my dad called my uncle
an ass and we never came back.

45
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,793
It smells like glue. I love it!

46
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,156
They just wallpapered.
Ghastly, isn't it?

47
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:59,079
Uh, yes. It's unusual.

48
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,323
You look a little...
unusual yourself.

49
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,567
I bet you're an artist or something.

50
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:10,090
No.
I'm a door-to-door kitchen salesman.

51
00:06:14,294 --> 00:06:16,336
I put you in No. 5. The best room.

52
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,420
It's cold, huh?

53
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:23,544
The boiler broke down.

54
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:25,345
But there are blankets.

55
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:29,710
And there's rum in the mini-bar.

56
00:06:31,752 --> 00:06:34,114
If you're really cold, dial 9,

57
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:36,156
I'll make a hot-water bottle.

58
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,735
No further
than last time you called.

59
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,058
Glad you think it's funny.

60
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:00,060
<i>Only a little...</i>

61
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:05,385
<i>Don't forget, if you want to come out
before the literary season...</i>

62
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:08,989
The book will come out
when it comes out.

63
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:10,511
<i>Forget about writing</i>

64
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:12,673

<i>You've received advances.

66
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:17,558
Then we'll break it.

67
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:20,521
You can't fit writing
into little timeslots.

68
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:22,082
<i>Very well.</i>

69
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,525
<i>Take your time.</i>

70
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:29,089
<i>But with another publisher.
I've reached my limits.</i>

71

<i>Captain Colbert, could you explain?</i>

90
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:24,084
<i>It's an area

<i>Thus her mysterious death

95
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:36,937
Always happens.
It's the snow on the lines.

96
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:40,460
I won't ask if you slept well.

97
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,860
<i>- Forget something?
#- I started.</i>

98
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,783
I have an idea. A title in any case.

99
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:25,185
<i>That's a start. What is it?</i>

100
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:27,387
"No Man's Land".

101
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,269
<i>Not very catchy, is it?</i>

102
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,831
<i>What's it about?</i>

103
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:33,554
A town called Mouthe,

104
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:36,076
where a local starlet is found dead.

105
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:38,639
A blond who did cheese commercials.

106
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,763
<i>A cheese star...
In a no man's land... In Mouthe...</i>

107
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:46,567
I need to dig deeper.
This might be something.

108
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:48,889
I've been thinking...

109
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:52,813
I'd like to write under another name.
How about "Magnus H�rn"?

110
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:54,655
With a slashed "o".

111
00:10:57,538 --> 00:11:00,541
<i>Start writing,
we'll discuss that later.</i>

112
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:04,224
<i>Have fun in your "no man's land".
And don't get lost.</i>

113
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,093
Looking for something?

114
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:16,256
Inspiration.

115
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:27,307
Look elsewhere.
This area's off limits.

116
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:30,591
I'm investigating
for my next detective novel.

117
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:33,433
Please leave...

118
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,575
I have hyperacute hearing.

119
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:59,339
My parents always wondered
why I jumped for nothing.

120
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,543
One day I fainted
when my mother was beating eggs.

121
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:05,465
But it doesn't only have bad sides.

122
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:07,147
Listen.

123
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:10,711
My footsteps in the snow...

124
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:13,353
I pick up every single detail,

125
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,355
like an oenologist tasting wine.

126
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:17,117
Listen.

127
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:42,142
The air is amazing here.

128
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:53,874
I saw you the other day,
when they took the body away.

129
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:55,636
You must be mistaken.

130
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:01,962
It is quite odd committing suicide
in the middle of nowhere,

131
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:04,525
where there'll be no investigation.

132
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:06,366
No?

133
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:09,089
Muckraking isn't my thing.

134
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:36,677
I saw episode 5.

135
00:14:36,797 --> 00:14:40,320
The psychic said to the writer:
"You're the man with a hood.

136
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,682
"Your linked is the '5'."

137
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:03,023
This elevator is for staff only.

138
00:15:03,343 --> 00:15:06,106
I'm her grandson.
They said I could come.

139
00:15:16,236 --> 00:15:19,199
Always happens.
It's the snow on the lines.

140
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,562
Shut the locker.

141
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:16,396
<i>At first I thought
he was just another crackpot,</i>

142
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:21,682
<i>like those two male nurses
who pawed my breasts.</i>

143
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,726
<i>But I'm not mad at them.</i>

144
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,611
<i>Even cold, I'm still the hottest gal
in all Franche-Comt�.</i>

145
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:34,615
<i>But this one took my hand,</i>

146
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:36,857
<i>he wasn't like the others.</i>

147
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:39,740
<i>I mean,
he didn't want to feel up my ass.</i>

148
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,063
<i>If we'd met before,</i>

149
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,426
<i>maybe I wouldn't be lying
on this stainless-steel table.</i>

150
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:49,389
<i>It's the story of my life...</i>

151
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,913
<i>I had to wait until I was dead</i>

152
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,635
<i>to meet a nice guy.</i>

153
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:57,157
What are you doing here?

154
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:58,919
It's not what you think.

155
00:18:04,444 --> 00:18:07,487
So you're Gilbert Rousseau's nephew,

156
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,252
and you investigate
like James Ellroy?

157
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:14,054
Yes.

158
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:19,059
May I ask who gave you permission?

159
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,141
No one.

160
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:26,827
There's a needle mark on her arm.

161
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:32,112
<i>Are you 100% certain...
that she committed suicide?</i>

162
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,717
One: The needle mark
is from a blood test the day before.

163
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:40,400
Two: She really did commit suicide.

164
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:42,523
And three: The case is closed.

165
00:18:43,403 --> 00:18:45,566
But the Stylnax is a glaring error!

166
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:50,971
One of my fans pointed out my mistake
in "Fiscal Paradise, My Love".

167
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,694
You can't swallow a tube
without water.

168
00:18:58,899 --> 00:18:59,540
And four:

169
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,823
This isn't America. This is Mouthe.

170
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:06,947
So I suggest
you find another story.

171
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,470
And stay out of morgues.

172
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:13,313
Next time,
I might be less sympathetic.

173
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:15,756
Thank you.

174
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:34,935
Do you know
where Candice Lecoeur lived?

175
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:36,817
In the old cookie factory.

176
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:39,780
Rue de la Source.
It used to be a factory.

177
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,061
It's that way.

178
00:21:21,602 --> 00:21:23,924
<i>Thursday 1.'00 pm
Jiminy Cricket</i>

179
00:22:24,064 --> 00:22:26,506
<i>Thursday, June 1, 1990</i>

180
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:27,788
<i>I'm 13 years old.</i>

181
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:30,270
<i>It's the day of my revenge.</i>

182
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,114
<i>Our first day at the pool.</i>

183
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,277
<i>As usual,
the two little sluts made fun of me</i>

184
00:22:37,437 --> 00:22:40,040
<i>because of my Wal-Mart sweatsuit.</i>

185
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:45,485
Look at her clothes,
they're from the Salvation Army.

186
00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:47,407
From a trash bin, I'd say.

187
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:51,331
<i>But underneath
I wore my too-small bathing suit.</i>

188
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:54,294
I'm disgusted!

189
00:22:56,296 --> 00:22:57,858
<i>When I came out of the showers,</i>

190
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:01,061
<i>I walked real slow,
like Madonna in Vogue.</i>

191
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:10,791
<i>The boys ogled that suit
as if it were a gold mine.</i>

192
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:15,035
Boys!

193
00:23:16,757 --> 00:23:18,839
<i>I had this funny impression,</i>

194
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,203
<i>as if I were Martine Langevin,
the nobody,</i>

195
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:26,086
<i>and another girl too.</i>

196
00:23:27,568 --> 00:23:29,449
<i>One I didn't know yet.</i>

197
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:11,171
A Peugeot convertible
with Paris plates stands out.

198
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,663
I told you,
Colbert told you: Drop it.

199
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:30,871
You know her secretary
was broken into?

200
00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:34,114
There's every diary
until November 2009,

201
00:24:34,274 --> 00:24:36,917
then the last one's missing!
Isn't that odd?

202
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,921
I don't have all day.

203
00:24:44,645 --> 00:24:45,846
What do her parents say?

204
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,649
She had no father
and her mom's dead.

205
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:54,615
Yes, Captain.

206
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:56,617
Yes...

207
00:24:57,978 --> 00:24:59,740
I'm stuck on the road.

208
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,663
They didn't clear the snow,
as usual.

209
00:25:03,664 --> 00:25:05,185
Of course, Captain.

210
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:13,353
I'm sure
you have doubts too.

211
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:28,448
<i>Information, hello.</i>

212
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,090
Hello, could you tell me

213
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,734
if there's a Mr. Jiminy Cricket
in Mouthe?

214
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:35,776
<i>Cricket like the game?</i>

215
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:37,497
Like the animal.

216
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:42,222
<i>No, but I have a Juliette Geminy
in Mouthe. I'll put you through...</i>

217
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:09,850
Yes.

218
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:15,455
She was my patient.
I was her psychiatrist.

219
00:26:15,856 --> 00:26:18,579
I told you on the phone,
I can't help you.

220
00:26:18,699 --> 00:26:21,261
Listen, suppose that... maybe...

221
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:24,384
Candice didn't commit suicide.

222
00:26:24,905 --> 00:26:27,427
That would be perfect for your book,

223
00:26:27,548 --> 00:26:30,230
but who'd have killed her?
Everyone adored her.

224
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:32,553
She didn't say anything...

225
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:34,995
Please, don't insist.

226
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,682
It's funny,
but the more I look at you,

227
00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:45,405
the more I'm sure
you're hiding something.

228
00:26:51,532 --> 00:26:54,494
I have absolutely no right
to let you hear this.

229
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,421
<i>I'm floating...</i>

230
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:04,504
<i>I'm in my mother's belly.</i>

231
00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:07,027
<i>How do you feel?</i>

232
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:09,149
<i>I feel alone.</i>

233
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,674
<i>I want you to go back
even further in time.</i>

234
00:27:14,274 --> 00:27:15,435
<i>What do you see?</i>

235
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:17,758
Light...

236
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,041
It's pulling me up...

237
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:25,726
I'm walking rapidly
down a corridor...

238
00:27:25,886 --> 00:27:27,968
No. In a basement...

239
00:27:30,611 --> 00:27:32,412
<i>My heart is pounding.</i>

240
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:36,056
<i>I'm scared,
I'm doing something forbidden.</i>

241
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:40,661
<i>I'm walking behind a man in a suit.</i>

242
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:44,825
<i>He pulls me by the hand.</i>

243
00:27:48,388 --> 00:27:49,790
<i>He's so strong.</i>

244
00:27:51,912 --> 00:27:54,114
<i>His perfume is divine.</i>

245
00:27:57,317 --> 00:27:59,359
<i>He brings me to a room.</i>

246
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:02,482
<i>There's lush carpeting.</i>

247
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:07,047
<i>It's fabulous,
it's a suite in a hotel.</i>

248
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:10,571
<i>I laugh.</i>

249
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:20,340
<i>I know this man.</i>

250
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:23,784
It's President Kennedy.

251
00:28:26,386 --> 00:28:27,227
And...

252
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:30,831
I'm Marilyn.

253
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:42,162
And you believe it?

254
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:47,407
They were both born on June 1st.

255
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:50,971
She'd read many books about Marilyn.

256
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:54,014
For Candice,
she was the ideal "ego".

257
00:28:56,136 --> 00:29:00,821
Saying "I'm Marilyn" was a way
of screaming for help, of saying:

258
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:03,904
"Save me, or I'll end up like her."

259
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:55,495
Yeah, yeah!
Barking dogs never bite!

260
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:13,193
What nightclubs do you go to?

261
00:31:14,114 --> 00:31:17,477
There's "The Barracuda"
but it's kind of tacky.

262
00:31:17,598 --> 00:31:20,761
I prefer "The King", it's got style.
And great DJs,

263
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:24,124
like DJ Furax, DJ Sam
and the Oklahoma Bitches.

264
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:32,372
I'm off on Thursday nights...

265
00:31:33,493 --> 00:31:35,495
Sorry, but I hate discotheques.

266
00:31:51,712 --> 00:31:54,114
<i>Tuesday, November 20, 1999</i>

267
00:31:55,515 --> 00:31:56,917
<i>I put five pounds back on</i>

268
00:31:57,077 --> 00:31:59,960
<i>so I started my grapefruit,
egg & mayo diet again.</i>

269
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,722
<i>That really depressed me.</i>

270
00:32:03,684 --> 00:32:05,566
<i>But then a fabulous gift</i>

271
00:32:05,686 --> 00:32:06,887
<i>fell from the heavens...</i>

272
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:08,528
<i>In a red jeep.</i>

273
00:32:16,897 --> 00:32:18,859
- Hi.
- Fill her up?

274
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,861
Yeah.

275
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:30,390
I'm out here
taking pictures of locals.

276
00:32:30,711 --> 00:32:31,471
Swell.

277
00:32:32,753 --> 00:32:34,955
For the regional council calendar.

278
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:37,758
Would you pose for me?

279
00:32:43,203 --> 00:32:44,885
I'd have to fix myself up.

280
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:47,047
Don't touch a thing.

281
00:32:48,528 --> 00:32:49,249
Don't move.

282
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:51,251
You're perfect.

283
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:23,644
Why are you here?
You belong on magazine covers.

284
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,566
You're a natural.

285
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:27,848
My 5' 5 would never make it.

286
00:33:28,488 --> 00:33:29,890
What about the movies?

287
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,733
"Martine Langevin"
is no star's name.

288
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:34,815
You can change your name.

289
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:37,337
You remind me of a candy cane.

290
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:38,458
Candice!

291
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:40,741
What's your grandma's name?

292
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:42,062
Lecoeur.

293
00:33:42,703 --> 00:33:43,944
"Candice Lecoeur"...

294
00:33:44,504 --> 00:33:46,306
Now that's a star's name!

295
00:33:46,787 --> 00:33:47,828
You think so?

296
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,069
<i>He was right...</i>

297
00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:51,471
<i>My only chance of becoming someone</i>

298
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:53,353
<i>was becoming someone else.</i>

299
00:33:54,194 --> 00:33:55,956
<i>April 1, 2000</i>

300
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,478
<i>It must be spring everywhere

301
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,320
<i>except my hometown.</i>

302
00:34:00,961 --> 00:34:03,163
<i>I was prepared
for another crappy day.</i>

303
00:34:03,283 --> 00:34:05,125
<i>But thanks to the calendar,</i>

304
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:07,247
<i>I was contacted for an audition.</i>

305
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:08,969
<i>I love the word alone.</i>

309

<i>I was chosen...</i>

<i>Blond is crass,

<i>Blond wouldn't be me.</i>

00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,801
<i>we don't call it cheese...</i>

321
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,804
<i>we call it "The Belle of Jura".</i>

322
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:26,847
<i>"The Belle of Jura",</i>

323
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:29,730
<i>the cheese that will satisfy
your every desire.</i>

324
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,812
Cut! That was perfect.

325
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,462
<i>I'm happier than I've ever been...</i>

326
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:45,185
<i>Martine was not really me.</i>

327
00:35:45,906 --> 00:35:48,388
<i>The real me,
is perhaps her, Candice.</i>

328
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,791
<i>The blond.</i>

329
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,794
<i>Don't worry,
you don't have to get dressed up.</i>

330
00:37:53,954 --> 00:37:56,557
<i>Catherine's coming,
she's mad about you.</i>

331
00:37:57,998 --> 00:37:59,920
<i>Every time she comes you cancel.</i>

332
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:02,843
<i>- When are you back?
#- I don't know.</i>

333
00:38:02,963 --> 00:38:05,085
I'll let you know, Fred.

334
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:08,128
I have to go. We'll talk later.

335
00:38:09,209 --> 00:38:11,371
I read "The Andalusian Murder".
I liked it.

336
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:14,655
But your Inspector Voltaire
isn't very realistic.

337
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:20,220
Read this, it'll make
your investigations more credible.

338
00:38:22,102 --> 00:38:24,024
I guess I should say thank you.

339
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,465
No...

340
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:27,347
It's just to show you.

341
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,672
You want to join the FBI?

342
00:38:31,992 --> 00:38:33,473
No, the Canadian Police.

343
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:35,756
But the exams are tough.

344
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:40,040
To cast molds in snow,
they use sulfur and boiling water.

345
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,443
The mixture creates a thermal shock.

346
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:45,606
And?

347
00:38:45,886 --> 00:38:46,887
And...

348
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,093
This is Candice's impression
in no man's land.

349
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:54,454
It's much too deep.

350
00:38:54,575 --> 00:38:57,337
As if someone had carried her.

351
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:03,063
The medical examiner said

352
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:05,385
her bruise was due to a blow.

353
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:07,948
Why are you telling me?

354
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,952
They're sticking
to the suicide story.

355
00:39:12,112 --> 00:39:13,994
Colbert has no choice.

356
00:39:14,114 --> 00:39:16,196
But I want to know the truth.

357
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:19,600
And you want me to help?

358
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,401
Good. You follow me.

359
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,213
The letter "M"
was stamped on her hand.

360
00:39:33,574 --> 00:39:34,975
That I know.

361
00:39:35,656 --> 00:39:37,377
But if you fill in the "M"...

362
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,140
You have a crown...

363
00:39:40,941 --> 00:39:42,342
The logo of "The King".

364
00:39:43,463 --> 00:39:45,065
Maybe Candice went there?

365
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:50,190
I have to go.

366
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,673
The Blanchard kid
is acting up again.

367
00:39:53,554 --> 00:39:55,435
But be discreet.

368
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:01,922
I want a woman! A woman!

369
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:06,246
Come on, get down.

370
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:12,052
Is the writer still at the hotel?

371
00:40:12,332 --> 00:40:13,253
Yeah.

372
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,618
But he's changed his storyline:

373
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:21,982
A Mother Superior is found strangled
in a church with her rosary.

374
00:40:22,743 --> 00:40:24,985
It's called: "The Mouthe Mystery".

375
00:40:27,227 --> 00:40:29,069
OK, go get him. He'll freeze.

376
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:33,033
I wanna eat pussy!

377
00:40:33,594 --> 00:40:36,516
Puuuuuuussy!

378
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,001
Friday, 3:00 pm.

379
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:43,604
You saw her the day before she died.

380
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:45,125
Yes, for her color.

381
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,207
She'd only let me do it.

382
00:40:47,768 --> 00:40:49,890
With peroxide, like Marilyn.

383
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:53,894
That day, she made me promise
to do her hair if she died.

384
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:55,495
Isn't that weird?

385
00:40:55,816 --> 00:40:56,617
I said yes, but I...

386
00:40:56,937 --> 00:40:59,660
- Was she upset?
- She was in terrific form.

387
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,623
She was going to be in a movie
in the region.

388
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:03,744
What film?

389
00:41:03,864 --> 00:41:06,787
Even I didn't know.
She was very superstitious.

390
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:08,508
I'm coming, Mrs. Humbert!

391
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:14,074
They say someone on
the regional council pulled strings.

392
00:41:15,115 --> 00:41:16,316
Will I be in your book?

393
00:41:16,436 --> 00:41:17,758
Possibly.

394
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,122
How's everything? You like it?

395
00:41:22,242 --> 00:41:24,725
It doesn't look like this.

396
00:41:25,165 --> 00:41:26,246
True.

397
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,849
But that's a photo with lighting.

398
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,491
It makes me look younger, no?

399
00:41:32,813 --> 00:41:35,055
You might see me in a novel.

400
00:41:35,175 --> 00:41:36,697
I'll be the muse.

401
00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:38,138
Oh, my!

402
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:42,502
Put some hair color gloss
on Mrs. Humbert for extra shine.

403
00:41:43,143 --> 00:41:45,305
She was all happy

404
00:41:45,465 --> 00:41:47,588
until she received a phone call.

405
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,389
It lasted 20 minutes.

406
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:51,552
She was completely
different after.

407
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:53,233
All depressed.

408
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:57,678
I think
it must've been a love affair.

409
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,562
Gus wanted to see her again,
he never forgot her.

410
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:03,163
Who's Gus?

411
00:42:03,283 --> 00:42:05,766
Her ex-husband, Gustave Materazzi.

412
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:08,048
The Nordic skiing champion.

413
00:42:08,488 --> 00:42:10,290
The race with a rifle.

414
00:42:11,371 --> 00:42:15,335
Maybe Babeth, Gus's new wife,
discovered something.

415
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:17,618
She's jealous
as a bull in a china shop.

416
00:42:18,258 --> 00:42:20,581
It's normal for a girl
to be jealous.

417
00:42:20,741 --> 00:42:22,663
To the extent of killing your rival?

418
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:24,264
Cathy, can you come here?

419
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,554
<i>Thursday, October 13, 2001</i>

420
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:35,395
<i>A horrible day.</i>

421
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:37,477
<i>Gus lost it again.</i>

422
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:40,881
<i>And all because of a good deed.'</i>

423
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:44,925
<i>A fundraising calendar
for the Mouthe Chapel.</i>

424
00:42:45,405 --> 00:42:48,729
That's good. Boys look at her.

425
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:53,213
Candice, look at the camera.
Right at the lens, please.

426
00:42:53,413 --> 00:42:58,418
That's good. Smile, give me a smile.
That's perfect.

427
00:42:58,538 --> 00:43:03,183
Boys, look at the camera!
Come on, firefighter friends, smile!

428
00:43:03,423 --> 00:43:05,666
Candice, give me a haughty smile.

429
00:43:05,906 --> 00:43:07,988
Don't move, that's fantastic.

430
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:11,712
You can put her down now.
Gently, she's delicate.

431
00:43:16,156 --> 00:43:18,438
Join the brigade, we need women!

432
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:21,201
- We have Judith.
- What did I say?

433
00:43:22,963 --> 00:43:25,085
How about a drink at the "Ermitage"?

434
00:43:25,525 --> 00:43:27,167
No, I have to go home.

435
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,850
I told Gus I was at the pool.

436
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:31,531
Maybe next time.

437
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:32,573
Once a fireman...

438
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,894
Always a fireman!

439
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:36,857
An autograph, please!

440
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,421
- Who's it for?
- Marie.

441
00:43:41,982 --> 00:43:43,383
<i>Teddy Cannelle
for L'Est R�publicain#...</i>

442
00:43:43,503 --> 00:43:46,386
How does it feel
to be the new regional star?

443
00:43:46,506 --> 00:43:47,908
I'm no star,

444
00:43:48,068 --> 00:43:49,509
or anyone can shine.

445
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:50,671
What's your name?

446
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:52,272
Julien Charlemagne.

447
00:43:53,754 --> 00:43:54,715
What a funny name.

448
00:43:57,397 --> 00:43:59,920
- Can I have a picture with you?
- Of course.

449
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,682
Lucky!

450
00:44:02,563 --> 00:44:04,204
<i>I never get tired of fans.</i>

451
00:44:04,805 --> 00:44:06,166
<i>They remind you</i>

452
00:44:07,768 --> 00:44:10,490
<i>that you're loved,
and that you're lucky.</i>

453
00:44:12,012 --> 00:44:13,133
Thank you!

454
00:44:19,219 --> 00:44:19,940
I'm wiped out.

455
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:22,943
I swam 40 laps.

456
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:24,985
How are you?

457
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:34,514
<i>This is Jean-Claude,</i>

458
00:44:34,635 --> 00:44:38,438
<i>I'm confirming the shoot
this afternoon with the firemen.</i>

459
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:39,760
<i>See you later.</i>

460
00:44:40,641 --> 00:44:44,004
Did you show off your ass?
Did you like it?

461
00:44:44,845 --> 00:44:45,966
It was for a good cause.

462
00:44:48,008 --> 00:44:49,770
That's for a good cause too!

463
00:44:54,094 --> 00:44:55,776
<i>He'll change one day.</i>

464
00:44:56,496 --> 00:44:57,818
<i>I'll help him.</i>

465
00:44:57,938 --> 00:45:00,661
<i>It's not me he's hitting,
it's Candice,</i>

466
00:45:01,582 --> 00:45:04,304
<i>because she belongs to the public.</i>

467
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:07,347
<i>But only he loves Martine.</i>

468
00:45:43,423 --> 00:45:45,465
- Your name?
- Rousseau.

469
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:48,589
- You're not on the list.
- I know, it's because...

470
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:51,231
- You the cousin from Bordeaux?
- Yes.

471
00:45:51,391 --> 00:45:53,513
David Rousseau from Bordeaux.

472
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:56,436
A 12-hour drive. At night.
So many trucks.

473
00:45:56,557 --> 00:45:58,398
But hey, she was my cousin.

474
00:45:58,518 --> 00:46:01,882
We knew each other as kids
but we lost touch and...

475
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:04,725
Follow me, please.

476
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:05,926
Thank you.

477
00:46:07,007 --> 00:46:08,328
- Go on.
- Thanks.

478
00:46:14,214 --> 00:46:15,736
Get lost, Mr. Intellectual!

479
00:46:16,016 --> 00:46:17,738
- Gus, not today.
- She was happy with me.

480
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,259
You ruined her life!

481
00:46:19,419 --> 00:46:20,821
Happy! Who are you kidding?

482
00:46:20,941 --> 00:46:22,543
Don't break my balls.

483
00:46:22,663 --> 00:46:24,865
She died because of your pills.

484
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:30,310
Gus, calm down or I'll make you.

485
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:33,353
It's OK, Mr. Materazzi
never hits women in public.

486
00:46:36,557 --> 00:46:39,519
You weren't so tough in school
without a uniform.

487
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,442
- Come on, go inside.
- You should be ashamed!

488
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,244
All of you!

489
00:46:44,484 --> 00:46:48,649
"It's your fault!" "No, it's not."
"Yes, it is!"

490
00:46:49,129 --> 00:46:52,212
Like bees round a honeypot
over her dead body.

491
00:46:53,093 --> 00:46:54,775
You all killed her!

492
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:00,220
Yes!

493
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:09,509
Playing hero?

494
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,552
We're like that in Bordeaux.

495
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:17,878
Candice was ever avid for life.

496
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,762
She never liked goodbyes,
I will say au revoir.

497
00:47:22,122 --> 00:47:24,565
For the country
to which she has gone,

498
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:26,486
we must all some day visit...

499
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,121
<i>Well...</i>

500
00:48:41,562 --> 00:48:44,645
<i>I'm afraid of discovering
what hell is really like.</i>

501
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,411
<i>Even if I already know.</i>

502
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:00,220
<i>It must be like Mouthe.</i>

503
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:14,354
Excuse me, are you David Rousseau?

504
00:49:14,835 --> 00:49:15,916
The detective novel

505
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,199
about a striptease dancer
and a drag queen cop?

506
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,841
Transsexual.

507
00:49:21,882 --> 00:49:24,164
In France, we're lacking writers...

508
00:49:25,445 --> 00:49:27,527
who are as implausible as you.

509
00:49:27,928 --> 00:49:29,610
- Is that a compliment?
- No.

510
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:31,291
Simon Denner.

511
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:33,694
Book reviewer for "Mouthopolis".

512
00:49:34,695 --> 00:49:36,977
The show
Candice did the weather for.

513
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:40,340
You always attend
your fans' funerals?

514
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,742
No.

515
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:45,025
- Candice read my books?
- Yeah.

516
00:49:45,305 --> 00:49:47,307
She even wanted to write you.

517
00:49:47,948 --> 00:49:50,150
We argued quite a bit about you.

518
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:32,673
"Who killed Roselyn?"

519
00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:42,202
<i>Roselyn savored
the incredible anonymity.</i>

520
00:50:42,362 --> 00:50:44,284
<i>It wasn't a question of makeup.</i>

521
00:50:44,404 --> 00:50:48,408
<i>In fact, people only saw her
when she decided to appear.</i>

522
00:50:57,738 --> 00:50:59,539
Alizarine Publishing House.

523
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:03,503
<i>Calling Alizarine Publishing House.</i>

524
00:51:03,944 --> 00:51:05,826
<i>Alizarine Publishing House.</i>

525
00:51:06,306 --> 00:51:08,268
Hello, Moneypenny, how are you?

526
00:51:09,229 --> 00:51:11,391
<i>What can I do for you 007?</i>

527
00:51:12,673 --> 00:51:15,195
Could you look through my fan mail

528
00:51:15,395 --> 00:51:18,919
and see if a certain
Candice Lecoeur wrote me?

529
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:20,841
Or a Martine Langevin.

530
00:51:21,642 --> 00:51:25,405
<i>Should I send an autographed photo
with your number?</i>

531
00:51:25,726 --> 00:51:27,087
It's important.

532
00:51:28,408 --> 00:51:32,172
<i>OK, I'll look for it.
But what do I get in return?</i>

533
00:51:33,654 --> 00:51:36,617
A wheel
of 18-month-old Comt� cheese.

534
00:51:38,218 --> 00:51:40,621
<i>You know
how to make a girl melt, 007.</i>

535
00:51:41,662 --> 00:51:42,663
I know.

536
00:52:25,465 --> 00:52:26,867
OK, listen here:

537
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:30,671
I used bicycle training wheels
until I was 11.

538
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:24,124
<i>Monday, June 29, 2005</i>

539
00:53:24,805 --> 00:53:26,046
<i>Today I met Simon...</i>

540
00:53:27,928 --> 00:53:29,409
<i>I'm not late on purpose.</i>

541
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,332
<i>They think I'm a diva...</i>

542
00:53:32,532 --> 00:53:36,296
<i>but it takes hours to transform
the pumpkin into a doll.</i>

543
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,379
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

544
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,662
No, I'm sorry.

545
00:53:44,865 --> 00:53:46,506
- Are you the new guy?
- Yes.

546
00:53:47,027 --> 00:53:49,269
I think they're getting impatient.

547
00:53:50,871 --> 00:53:52,392
- Sorry...
- It's OK.

548
00:53:54,074 --> 00:53:56,436
Everyone in place for a rehearsal.

549
00:53:56,557 --> 00:53:58,078
Whenever you're ready, Candice.

550
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:01,361
Today the sun rises
at 6:06 am with the...

551
00:54:01,682 --> 00:54:03,804
Shit. What was it?
The Paris what?

552
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:05,846
Paris-Geneva.

553
00:54:06,006 --> 00:54:08,929
<i>Candice, you're a pain in the ass.
Five lines!</i>

554
00:54:09,209 --> 00:54:11,531
<i>Fuck!
A 5- year-old could learn them!</i>

555
00:54:11,652 --> 00:54:12,853
Shit!

556
00:54:13,213 --> 00:54:14,615
Fuck you!

557
00:54:28,589 --> 00:54:31,431
You're just tired.
You need a break.

558
00:54:33,754 --> 00:54:37,197
We're on the air.
You'll have to do the weather live.

559
00:54:38,919 --> 00:54:40,120
With this face?

560
00:54:40,961 --> 00:54:42,522
Sandrine can replace you.

561
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,084
No.

562
00:54:44,404 --> 00:54:46,647
The public wants Candice.

563
00:54:53,213 --> 00:54:57,738
<i>Dimitri & Jeremy from La Chapelle
des Bois.' "It's Snowing on LA".</i>

564
00:54:57,978 --> 00:54:58,699
Get the rest.

565
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,142
<i>Now the weather
with Candice Lecoeur.</i>

566
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,361
Hello!

567
00:55:21,562 --> 00:55:25,766
Today the sun rises at 6:06 am
with the Paris-Geneva train.

568
00:55:26,086 --> 00:55:29,810
You can graze peacefully
for the skies will be overcast

569
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,372
from Rochejean
to La Chapelle des Bois,

570
00:55:33,013 --> 00:55:36,296
and from Rousses to Pontarlier
via Malbuisson.

571
00:55:37,217 --> 00:55:39,780
After the 2:13 pm Chamb�ry-Mulhouse,

572
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,503
showers will appear
between Mouthe and Morteau.

573
00:55:43,824 --> 00:55:45,946
We're going
to smell like wet dogs...

574
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,629
Or rather wet bitches...

575
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:54,995
Temperatures of 20�C in the north
and 22�C in the southernmost fields.

576
00:55:55,836 --> 00:55:57,918
You might die of heat,

577
00:55:58,038 --> 00:56:02,002
unless you take my advice
and shed your winter coats.

578
00:56:08,288 --> 00:56:10,971
And don't forget Pablo,
the neighbor's bull.

579
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:14,655
It's his name day
and he has a real treat in store.

580
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:31,792
Mirror, mirror...

581
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:35,796
You never tire of yourself?

582
00:56:35,956 --> 00:56:37,758
It's not me I'm looking at.

583
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:39,840
It's her.

584
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:43,403
You look like Ann Baxter.

585
00:56:44,244 --> 00:56:46,446
- I don't know her.
- A beautiful actress.

586
00:56:47,087 --> 00:56:49,009
She played in "All About Eve"

587
00:56:49,129 --> 00:56:51,251
and "The Ten Commandments"
by Cecil B. DeMille.

588
00:56:51,371 --> 00:56:53,093
I don't know her either.

589
00:56:53,533 --> 00:56:54,374
He's a man.

590
00:56:57,698 --> 00:56:59,740
I think
I could teach you a lot.

591
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:03,744
<i>I didn't grow up with books.</i>

592
00:57:04,745 --> 00:57:07,107
<i>I was so hungry to learn,
to catch up...</i>

593
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:11,912
"Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.

594
00:57:16,717 --> 00:57:18,478
"I will kiss thy lips;

595
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,042
"Haply some poison
yet doth hang on them,

596
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,605
"To make die with a restorative...

597
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:28,008
"Yea, noise?

598
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,371
"O happy dagger!
This is thy sheath..."

599
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:39,459
O charlatan apothecary!

600
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:44,504
Thy drugs are not as deadly
as you said!

601
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:45,786
More!

602
00:57:54,074 --> 00:57:55,716
My tomb shall wait!

603
00:58:00,841 --> 00:58:03,043
<i>We all dream of meeting our Romeo.</i>

604
00:58:03,163 --> 00:58:05,646
<i>We want to believe
someone's waiting for us,</i>

605
00:58:05,806 --> 00:58:08,609
<i>without whom
something will always be missing.</i>

606
00:58:08,769 --> 00:58:10,651
<i>Even if we know love ends badly...</i>

607
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:24,104
I was so scared, it took me
three months to ask her out!

608
00:58:24,344 --> 00:58:26,186
She took it
as a sign of respect.

609
00:58:26,426 --> 00:58:28,629
Our story
was founded on a mix-up,

610
00:58:29,029 --> 00:58:30,150
it couldn't last.

611
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:33,193
You sound
like you never loved her.

612
00:58:33,874 --> 00:58:35,596
Candice was no piece of cake.

613
00:58:35,756 --> 00:58:38,518
She was egocentric,
narcissistic, unsatisfied...

614
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:41,281
The saddest girl I've ever met.

615
00:58:41,682 --> 00:58:43,924
It wasn't her first suicide attempt.

616
00:59:16,677 --> 00:59:19,319
I'm not even capable
of having a child.

617
00:59:56,637 --> 00:59:57,638
Good evening.

618
00:59:58,078 --> 01:00:01,121
The mechanic called to say
your car was fixed.

619
01:00:01,521 --> 01:00:04,565
But he insisted
it was a near miracle.

620
01:00:05,205 --> 01:00:06,326
What about the boiler?

621
01:00:06,486 --> 01:00:09,570
Still broken, but someone came
to drain the radiators.

622
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:12,532
How about that hot toddy?

623
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:14,695
I'll bring it up to you?

624
01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:15,976
Thanks.

625
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,301
What's your name?

626
01:00:22,222 --> 01:00:22,943
Betty.

627
01:00:23,263 --> 01:00:24,504
Thank you, Betty.

628
01:01:10,631 --> 01:01:12,352
"Groom service!"

629
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,633
Don't move. I'll call an ambulance.

630
01:01:55,916 --> 01:01:58,919
Last time, Candice Lecoeur
didn't commit suicide

631
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:01,722
and now
someone's trying to kill you?

632
01:02:02,002 --> 01:02:06,086
How did bare electric wires
come in contact with my water pipes?

633
01:02:06,206 --> 01:02:09,249
It's an old hotel.
Safety standards are so-so.

634
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:13,373
Or rodents.
The baker's wife died like that.

635
01:02:13,894 --> 01:02:15,936
A mouse ate her toaster wires.

636
01:02:16,096 --> 01:02:17,337
Must be that.

637
01:02:17,858 --> 01:02:21,742
I understand it's a shock,
but you have too much imagination.

638
01:02:22,783 --> 01:02:24,625
By the way, how's the book?

639
01:02:25,465 --> 01:02:27,427
I hear you found a new story?

640
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:29,590
Uh, yes...

641
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:32,072
A nun strangled with her rosary.

642
01:02:32,392 --> 01:02:34,474
- And the culprit is?
- The gardener.

643
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:36,837
He's Spanish. Javier.

644
01:02:38,238 --> 01:02:39,880
In fact, he's her son.

645
01:02:41,401 --> 01:02:45,686
She slept with the carpenter
who repaired the roof

646
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:48,448
after the fire in the distillery.

647
01:02:51,171 --> 01:02:53,493
- And the title is...
- "The Mouthe Mystery".

648
01:02:54,134 --> 01:02:56,617
It's a work in progress.

649
01:02:57,618 --> 01:02:59,219
Nothing's definite.

650
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,422
Now what about my assault?

651
01:03:03,303 --> 01:03:04,945
You think we investigate

652
01:03:05,105 --> 01:03:06,827
every time someone slips on ice?

653
01:03:07,467 --> 01:03:08,709
No.

654
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:12,072
We save that for strangled nuns.

655
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,082
I didn't know
it was nudist on Thursdays.

656
01:03:22,402 --> 01:03:24,885
I'm not sure
trunks would've been better.

657
01:03:25,485 --> 01:03:26,767
You always make dates...

658
01:03:26,927 --> 01:03:29,009
In places
we won't be seen together.

659
01:03:31,612 --> 01:03:34,254
I checked. Your wires
were stripped with pliers.

660
01:03:34,775 --> 01:03:36,296
It wasn't an accident.

661
01:03:37,217 --> 01:03:37,898
Shit.

662
01:03:38,058 --> 01:03:40,500
I told you,
you've got to be discreet.

663
01:03:44,585 --> 01:03:46,266
Who have you talked to?

664
01:03:47,387 --> 01:03:49,189
Simon,
her shrink and her hairdresser.

665
01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:50,550
Cathy?

666
01:03:51,672 --> 01:03:53,393
Then the whole world knows.

667
01:04:01,281 --> 01:04:03,003
You know something?

668
01:04:04,484 --> 01:04:06,526
Candice writes better than me.

669
01:04:07,527 --> 01:04:09,650
It's her diary we should publish.

670
01:04:12,613 --> 01:04:14,494
When I saw her at the morgue...

671
01:04:15,415 --> 01:04:17,297
I had this strange feeling.

672
01:04:18,579 --> 01:04:21,982
Maybe if I'd met her before,
she wouldn't be dead.

673
01:04:26,707 --> 01:04:28,148
I'll show you something.

674
01:04:31,151 --> 01:04:33,313
These are
from the CCTV at "The King".

675
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:35,636
You see, 11:05 pm.

676
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:37,878
Candice arrived. And she left

677
01:04:38,158 --> 01:04:40,000
at 1:15 am. There.

678
01:04:40,641 --> 01:04:42,362
Followed by two men...

679
01:04:42,803 --> 01:04:45,726
I scanned, zoomed
and improved the contrast.

680
01:04:47,047 --> 01:04:49,570
Your FBI book is cool.

681
01:04:51,051 --> 01:04:55,015
Then by a curious coincidence,
the camera died, due to the frost.

682
01:04:57,778 --> 01:05:00,500
The image came back one hour later.

683
01:05:02,382 --> 01:05:03,824
Six cars are missing.

684
01:05:04,024 --> 01:05:05,465
I'll check the plates.

685
01:05:05,626 --> 01:05:07,307
Why would anyone kill her?

686
01:05:07,507 --> 01:05:08,709
We need to find the motive.

687
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,672
We need an investigation first.

688
01:05:14,675 --> 01:05:15,956
So what?

689
01:05:16,196 --> 01:05:19,680
With all the proof in the world,
the case is nonexistent.

690
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,644
We could get a listing of her calls.
Her phone disappeared!

691
01:05:24,404 --> 01:05:25,886
If we have enough evidence...

692
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:27,247
OK.

693
01:05:32,372 --> 01:05:33,654
I'll handle it.

694
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:39,740
I could punish you for indiscipline.

695
01:05:43,904 --> 01:05:45,265
Thank you, Captain.

696
01:05:46,186 --> 01:05:48,589
It's their 50th anniversary.
Which one?

697
01:05:48,749 --> 01:05:49,630
One of each.

698
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,152
That's a wise choice!

699
01:05:52,272 --> 01:05:54,234
They'll be collectors' items.

700
01:05:54,595 --> 01:05:57,077
Especially now
with the poor girl dead.

701
01:05:57,598 --> 01:05:59,960
Look who's come
to pay us a visit!

702
01:06:00,921 --> 01:06:03,003
Mr. President,
pleased to meet you.

703
01:06:03,123 --> 01:06:04,044
Likewise.

704
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:06,006
Who's that?

705
01:06:06,126 --> 01:06:07,287
Our president.

706
01:06:07,407 --> 01:06:08,528
The American!

707
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:10,450
Isn't he handsome?

708
01:06:11,331 --> 01:06:13,574
His dad had him
with the au pair girl.

709
01:06:13,734 --> 01:06:14,454
The president?

710
01:06:14,815 --> 01:06:17,337
Jean-Fran�ois Burdeau,
Regional President.

711
01:06:18,819 --> 01:06:21,341
His mother raised him in America,

712
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:25,626
but he came back at 18
and never left.

713
01:06:26,907 --> 01:06:28,388
That'll be 12.40 euros.

714
01:06:28,949 --> 01:06:30,110
Thank you.

715
01:06:31,351 --> 01:06:34,434
<i>JFK told Marilyn
he was in love with her.</i>

716
01:06:52,973 --> 01:06:54,134
What's so important?

717
01:06:54,254 --> 01:06:56,136
Do you believe
in reincarnation?

718
01:06:57,297 --> 01:06:59,620
You were Agent Mulder
in a past life?

719
01:07:01,181 --> 01:07:02,743
Candice believed in it.

720
01:07:03,223 --> 01:07:04,625
She was born on a June 1st.

721
01:07:04,785 --> 01:07:08,508
She was blond and she died
of a probable suicide. Like Marilyn!

722
01:07:08,669 --> 01:07:11,111
- Is this why...
- Wait!

723
01:07:11,832 --> 01:07:14,915
Marilyn married Joe DiMaggio,
the ex baseball champ.

724
01:07:15,075 --> 01:07:17,037
Candice married Gustave Materazzi,

725
01:07:17,157 --> 01:07:18,919
the ex Nordic skiing champ.

726
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:22,522
Marilyn had an affair
with Arthur Miller, the writer.

727
01:07:22,923 --> 01:07:26,126
Candice dated the book reviewer,
Simon Denner...

728
01:07:26,767 --> 01:07:29,770
This is nonsense,
it's not getting us anywhere.

729
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:31,772
No, it's not nonsense.

730
01:07:32,492 --> 01:07:33,734
"JFK"...

731
01:07:37,698 --> 01:07:38,819
"JFB"...

732
01:07:38,979 --> 01:07:40,901
That can't be a coincidence.

733
01:07:41,341 --> 01:07:44,464
Candice got the lead role
in a film thanks to him.

734
01:07:44,985 --> 01:07:46,947
- Ask why he helped her?
- Why?

735
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:49,309
Because she was his mistress.

736
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:50,791
He dumped her.

737
01:07:51,111 --> 01:07:54,394
She menaced to tell all.
So he shut her up.

738
01:07:54,755 --> 01:07:56,436
I have the printout of her calls.

739
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,523
Sorry to disappoint you,
no calls to the regional president.

740
01:08:03,804 --> 01:08:05,245
Can I see that?

741
01:08:12,532 --> 01:08:14,534
- It's a fake.
- Yeah, right.

742
01:08:16,536 --> 01:08:17,818
Candice received a call

743
01:08:18,098 --> 01:08:20,941
on Friday at her hairdressers.
It's not here.

744
01:08:22,262 --> 01:08:24,705
- Who gave you this?
- Colbert. I told him.

745
01:08:24,865 --> 01:08:26,867
The President is pressuring him.

746
01:08:27,267 --> 01:08:28,869
Colbert falsified them.

747
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,312
And on 9l11 there were no planes.

748
01:08:33,073 --> 01:08:36,156
On second thought,
let's not go bowling tonight.

749
01:08:36,396 --> 01:08:37,517
Bowling?

750
01:08:38,558 --> 01:08:40,240
At the M�tabief Star Bowl?

751
01:08:41,561 --> 01:08:43,884
Candice loved going there to relax.

752
01:08:46,967 --> 01:08:50,090
If I win, you ask the phone company
for a new listing.

753
01:08:52,773 --> 01:08:53,734
102 to 97.

754
01:08:53,934 --> 01:08:55,776
Better find a new theory!

755
01:08:59,179 --> 01:09:01,461
- Game's not over yet.
- Yeah, make a strike.

756
01:09:09,469 --> 01:09:12,112
Bravo! Great roll!

757
01:09:12,392 --> 01:09:15,155
You're hot,
I'll go get that listing.

758
01:09:16,957 --> 01:09:18,238
I have another shot.

759
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,162
<i>I came here countless times.</i>

760
01:09:22,482 --> 01:09:24,605
<i>It was this or the skating rink.</i>

761
01:09:27,327 --> 01:09:29,409
<i>I was like that big black ball.</i>

762
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:33,253
<i>I always prayed
for a perfect roll...</i>

763
01:09:33,774 --> 01:09:35,576
<i>but each time it was the same.</i>

764
01:09:36,016 --> 01:09:39,139
<i>Even when I hit the pins,
one was left standing.</i>

765
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:42,222
<i>The ball was on the same tracks.</i>

766
01:09:43,183 --> 01:09:46,226
<i>Whatever I did,
I wound up in the same place...</i>

767
01:09:58,318 --> 01:10:01,722
OK. Only to prove that you're wrong.

768
01:10:06,807 --> 01:10:08,208
Here it is. What did I say?

769
01:10:08,368 --> 01:10:09,970
That we saw...

770
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:12,893
That we saw too...

771
01:10:17,257 --> 01:10:18,579
Last month...

772
01:10:19,139 --> 01:10:22,342
Candice called
Jean-Fran�ois Burdeau twice a day.

773
01:10:25,105 --> 01:10:27,067
And the call at the hairdressers?

774
01:10:31,031 --> 01:10:32,633
Bernard-Olivier Burdeau.

775
01:10:34,274 --> 01:10:36,556
- The president's brother?
- He's the prefect.

776
01:10:36,917 --> 01:10:38,158
Bobby!

777
01:10:40,641 --> 01:10:43,403
Here's another call
that was deleted.

778
01:10:43,563 --> 01:10:45,646
Candice's last call at 1:15 am.

779
01:10:45,846 --> 01:10:46,927
To the president?

780
01:10:47,047 --> 01:10:48,809
To Juliette Geminy.

781
01:10:49,529 --> 01:10:51,892
Candice
called everyone at all hours.

782
01:10:52,052 --> 01:10:54,815
Her hairdresser,
her makeup girl. Or me.

783
01:10:55,055 --> 01:10:57,417
I was asleep.
I saw it the next day.

784
01:10:58,178 --> 01:10:59,379
What did she say?

785
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,462
You want the proof
that I killed her?

786
01:11:03,143 --> 01:11:04,424
I'll give it to you.

787
01:11:12,512 --> 01:11:13,553
<i>Juliette?</i>

788
01:11:14,635 --> 01:11:15,796
<i>Juliette?</i>

789
01:11:16,436 --> 01:11:17,598
<i>Please come over.</i>

790
01:11:18,839 --> 01:11:20,560
<i>I might do something stupid.</i>

791
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:22,362
<i>Don't leave me alone.</i>

792
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:25,005
<i>You're all I have left...</i>

793
01:11:34,454 --> 01:11:35,936
You didn't call her back?

794
01:11:36,336 --> 01:11:38,979
She often
left me this kind of message.

795
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:42,262
I didn't want to get sucked
into her game anymore.

796
01:11:45,305 --> 01:11:46,947
Can I listen again?

797
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:03,764
When you said
shooting range I thought...

798
01:12:03,964 --> 01:12:05,726
You'd see me with a Beretta?

799
01:12:07,928 --> 01:12:11,892
You can choose your sport
for the Canadian Police exams.

800
01:12:13,453 --> 01:12:14,414
Well?

801
01:12:15,255 --> 01:12:17,497
I heard something in the message.

802
01:12:17,658 --> 01:12:21,181
There's another engine
in the background. A big one.

803
01:12:21,461 --> 01:12:24,424
The fan belt sounds like
it's ready to snap.

804
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:28,148
A black BMW was missing
off the parking lot.

805
01:12:28,468 --> 01:12:30,110
I'll call the garages.

806
01:12:30,751 --> 01:12:32,913
You should join the police yourself.

807
01:12:33,033 --> 01:12:34,234
Canadian?

808
01:12:36,476 --> 01:12:37,758
Here.

809
01:12:44,484 --> 01:12:46,486
Your wrist goes here.

810
01:12:46,607 --> 01:12:49,289
And three fingers here.

811
01:12:50,811 --> 01:12:53,894
Place your feet parallel,
your shoulders too.

812
01:12:54,975 --> 01:12:56,657
There's an arrow too.

813
01:12:56,817 --> 01:13:00,500
Always position the feather
facing outwards.

814
01:13:02,182 --> 01:13:04,264
- You got it?
- No. OK, that's good.

815
01:13:07,107 --> 01:13:09,469
One finger above, two below.

816
01:13:11,592 --> 01:13:13,754
The string has to touch your nose.

817
01:13:13,914 --> 01:13:15,756
You're allowed to breathe.

818
01:13:16,877 --> 01:13:18,959
To shoot, you relax your flexors.

819
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:22,803
The archer
doesn't release the string,

820
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:24,805
the string departs on its own.

821
01:13:27,047 --> 01:13:30,370
Canada will have to wait a while.

822
01:13:31,531 --> 01:13:32,693
Sorry. Here.

823
01:13:37,658 --> 01:13:39,499
Why did you join the police?

824
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:42,182
The majorettes
didn't have my skirt size.

825
01:13:43,143 --> 01:13:45,385
How did you become a writer?

826
01:13:46,466 --> 01:13:47,948
Let me guess...

827
01:13:48,068 --> 01:13:50,310
Dad's a teacher
and Mom's a librarian.

828
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:52,152
Nope. They bred dogs.

829
01:13:53,273 --> 01:13:56,116
I spent my time in exhibition halls

830
01:13:56,236 --> 01:13:58,198
with smelly dogs in cages.

831
01:13:58,558 --> 01:14:00,721
Not very literary, you see.

832
01:14:01,281 --> 01:14:02,883
It was school that saved me.

833
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:06,687
- What's wrong?
- The brakes are gone.

834
01:14:07,127 --> 01:14:08,929
- Put it in second.
- I am in second.

835
01:14:09,089 --> 01:14:10,851
- Then put it in first.
- I can't.

836
01:14:11,411 --> 01:14:12,252
It's stuck.

837
01:14:12,372 --> 01:14:14,895
Slam on the clutch!

838
01:14:16,016 --> 01:14:17,257
There is no more clutch!

839
01:14:32,873 --> 01:14:33,834
OK, don't panic.

840
01:14:34,114 --> 01:14:35,275
Up ahead, there's a turn.

841
01:14:35,636 --> 01:14:37,718
Drive into the embankment.

842
01:14:37,838 --> 01:14:39,439
- The snow will stop us.
- We're too fast!

843
01:14:44,284 --> 01:14:45,445
- Here it is.
- I know.

844
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:46,607
It's coming up.

845
01:14:46,767 --> 01:14:49,570
- Straight into the embankment.
- Shut up!

846
01:14:52,092 --> 01:14:53,493
- We're sliding.
- Shit!

847
01:14:56,777 --> 01:14:58,058
Watch out for the kids!

848
01:15:06,546 --> 01:15:08,388
You think they're dead?

849
01:15:15,275 --> 01:15:16,717
I won't ask how you're feeling.

850
01:15:16,877 --> 01:15:19,720
The nurses said
your X-rays are encouraging.

851
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,763
In two months
you'll be running like a hare.

852
01:15:23,844 --> 01:15:24,965
Next to my bed at home,

853
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:28,088
there's a box
with the photos and casts.

854
01:15:29,129 --> 01:15:31,011
Get them and return to Paris.

855
01:17:26,406 --> 01:17:28,408
<i>Saturday, December 6, 2009</i>

856
01:17:28,929 --> 01:17:30,450
<i>After the gym inauguration,</i>

857
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:34,214
<i>I went with the journalists
to the "Snowflake Saloon".</i>

858
01:18:06,607 --> 01:18:07,968
May I get you a drink?

859
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:10,651
A White Angel.

860
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:12,653
Like you, a white angel.

861
01:18:14,575 --> 01:18:15,335
Depends for whom...

862
01:18:16,136 --> 01:18:17,137
Jean-Fran�ois Burdeau.

863
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:20,540
Mr. President? I didn't know.

864
01:18:21,381 --> 01:18:22,062
Sorry.

865
01:18:22,262 --> 01:18:23,503
I'm clueless about politics.

866
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:26,386
A White Angel for the lady.

867
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:29,349
Vodka and gin
with a splash of champagne.

868
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,114
<i>That night,</i>

869
01:18:34,434 --> 01:18:37,718
<i>the president discovered
he preferred blonds.</i>

870
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:41,842
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have done it.</i>

871
01:18:43,323 --> 01:18:45,205
<i>But sex leads to love,</i>

872
01:18:46,246 --> 01:18:47,968
<i>or at least you think it does.</i>

873
01:19:52,593 --> 01:19:54,955
<i>The Burgundy Franche-Comt� Trophy</i>

874
01:19:55,155 --> 01:19:58,438
<i>for the 2009 Potato Competition,</i>

875
01:19:58,599 --> 01:20:00,320
is awarded to...

876
01:20:01,602 --> 01:20:03,163
Pierre Cottereau!

877
01:20:03,283 --> 01:20:06,206
From Malbuisson!

878
01:20:08,368 --> 01:20:11,652
Bravo Pierre!
A picture for the photographers.

879
01:20:16,056 --> 01:20:17,217
Congratulations.

880
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:22,823
Like I said earlier,
thank you all for joining us here

881
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:25,465
for this award ceremony.

882
01:20:26,506 --> 01:20:29,389
The trophy shouldn't be long...

883
01:20:31,672 --> 01:20:33,553
A little word for us, Pierre.

884
01:20:34,595 --> 01:20:35,996
I'm so moved.

885
01:20:36,797 --> 01:20:38,438
I'm so embarrassed.

886
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,002
The lovely Candice Lecoeur!

887
01:20:42,883 --> 01:20:46,967
Candice has surprised us
by dropping in on surprise.

888
01:20:49,289 --> 01:20:50,410
Good evening.

889
01:20:55,295 --> 01:20:57,417
I have a surprise for you tonight.

890
01:20:58,058 --> 01:21:00,741
It's the birthday of Jean-Fran�ois.

891
01:21:01,061 --> 01:21:02,502
Mr. Prez...

892
01:21:48,308 --> 01:21:49,630
Where is he?

893
01:21:51,672 --> 01:21:53,794
He told me to tell you it's over.

894
01:21:57,838 --> 01:21:59,760
He could tell me himself.

895
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,481
He's not coming.

896
01:22:02,442 --> 01:22:04,044
You're not the first one.

897
01:22:04,564 --> 01:22:07,167
He had fun with you,
like the others.

898
01:22:07,367 --> 01:22:09,129
I'm not like the others.

899
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:11,892
I'm not a piece of meat.

900
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:14,735
I understand,
but it's over nonetheless.

901
01:22:14,855 --> 01:22:16,577
Don't try to contact him.

902
01:22:56,697 --> 01:22:58,619
You're right. It's over!

903
01:22:59,339 --> 01:23:00,901
I won't make the same mistake!

904
01:23:01,021 --> 01:23:04,184
I'll make you and your brother
pay for this!

905
01:23:56,076 --> 01:23:58,078
<i>The real remedy would be to die.</i>

906
01:24:04,564 --> 01:24:06,687
<i>But I'm going to rewrite the end.</i>

907
01:24:08,889 --> 01:24:11,652
<i>I'm getting out of this place now.</i>

908
01:24:14,815 --> 01:24:15,936
<i>I'm not the kind of girl</i>

909
01:24:16,096 --> 01:24:18,939
<i>they find dead
with a bottle of pills in her hand.</i>

910
01:24:31,431 --> 01:24:33,513
It's all in here: JFB, BOB.

911
01:24:33,674 --> 01:24:35,555
They were afraid she'd snitch.

912
01:24:36,316 --> 01:24:39,479
Sorry, I called the garages.
The BMW isn't theirs.

913
01:24:42,042 --> 01:24:45,085
A 20-year-old kid brought it in:
Julien Charlemagne.

914
01:24:47,407 --> 01:24:49,970
Charlemagne... he's one of her fans.

915
01:25:14,034 --> 01:25:14,955
Hello.

916
01:25:15,916 --> 01:25:17,557
I'd like to talk about Candice.

917
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:31,491
Why did you follow Candice?

918
01:25:34,815 --> 01:25:36,416
It wasn't me. It was Ritchie.

919
01:25:36,817 --> 01:25:38,138
Who's Ritchie?

920
01:25:38,498 --> 01:25:40,220
The pharmacist's son.

921
01:25:40,861 --> 01:25:42,703
That's how we got the stuff.

922
01:25:44,024 --> 01:25:45,265
What stuff?

923
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:47,547
The GHB.

924
01:25:48,108 --> 01:25:51,952
He heard it helped score chicks.
It's like an aphrodisiac.

925
01:25:52,072 --> 01:25:56,116
It's not to score, it's to rape.
You know what rape means?

926
01:25:56,476 --> 01:26:00,040
Girls in slinky dresses
alone in discos are looking for it.

927
01:26:02,482 --> 01:26:04,845
<i>In the beginning,
they want your photo.</i>

928
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:08,769
<i>Then that's no longer enough.</i>

929
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,252
<i>They want your tits and ass.</i>

930
01:26:14,014 --> 01:26:15,896
<i>There's not much difference...</i>

931
01:26:16,897 --> 01:26:18,699
<i>It's all part of the dream.</i>

932
01:26:32,352 --> 01:26:35,155
<i>The people who love you
without knowing you,</i>

933
01:26:36,236 --> 01:26:38,919
<i>will later hate you
without knowing you...</i>

934
01:26:45,646 --> 01:26:48,048
Hi! Meet your greatest fan.

935
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:49,650
Julien.

936
01:26:53,854 --> 01:26:55,175
The drink's on him.

937
01:27:16,877 --> 01:27:17,918
Thank you.

938
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:20,601
Good night.

939
01:27:23,243 --> 01:27:24,564
Check out that ass.

940
01:28:13,774 --> 01:28:14,935
Juliette?

941
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:36,036
What are you doing here?

942
01:28:36,236 --> 01:28:37,397
Get out!

943
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:40,160
Give us the diary and we'll leave.

944
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,923
Get out, I said. Get out of here.

945
01:28:43,363 --> 01:28:44,685
Tell us where you hid it!

946
01:28:45,085 --> 01:28:47,447
There is no diary. I gave it...

947
01:28:47,928 --> 01:28:49,209
to my journalist friends.

948
01:28:56,256 --> 01:28:58,979
Your game's over, bastard!

949
01:28:59,139 --> 01:29:00,661
Get out of here, now!

950
01:29:05,305 --> 01:29:06,947
Bastard!

951
01:29:07,427 --> 01:29:09,509
Leave me alone, bastard!

952
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:20,601
This'll calm you down.

953
01:29:32,052 --> 01:29:33,654
You thought of everything.

954
01:29:34,454 --> 01:29:35,736
That's why you called me.

955
01:29:55,555 --> 01:29:56,997
What's going on?

956
01:29:58,158 --> 01:30:00,000
She was hysterical,
we brought her home.

957
01:30:05,365 --> 01:30:07,728
It's me, Juliette. Do you hear me?

958
01:30:10,570 --> 01:30:11,972
I'll take care of her.

959
01:30:48,528 --> 01:30:49,890
I'm so cold...

960
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:01,662
Wake up!

961
01:31:04,144 --> 01:31:05,666
Please, Candice!

962
01:31:08,468 --> 01:31:09,790
I killed her...

963
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:11,471
It's my fault.

964
01:31:15,195 --> 01:31:16,877
It's my fault.

965
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,802
I killed her.

966
01:31:22,362 --> 01:31:24,204
We'll take care of everything.

967
01:32:15,736 --> 01:32:16,777
<i>That's it.</i>

968

<i>The story was over,</i>

969
01:32:19,419 --> 01:32:20,741
<i>and I felt sad.</i>

970
01:32:21,662 --> 01:32:24,584
<i>I don't like it
when books and films end,</i>

971
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,628
<i>even less when they end badly.</i>

972

<i>I like happy endings.</i>

973
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:35,195

<i>Fortunately, he was killed
two months later. Playing golf.</i>

977
01:32:46,927 --> 01:32:48,809
<i>Hit in the head by a golf ball.</i>

978
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:22,262
<i>It's like the scene in your book,</i>

979
01:34:22,943 --> 01:34:26,707
<i>when Roselyn looks at Voltaire...
She knows he's a good man.</i>

980
01:34:29,549 --> 01:34:31,031
<i>But he can't see it,</i>

"It's always by the end
that stories begin."

985
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,202
I forgot,
this came this morning.

01:36:42,402 --> 01:36:43,443
Thank you.

987
01:36:47,167 --> 01:36:48,528
Bye.

988
01:36:48,809 --> 01:36:49,930
