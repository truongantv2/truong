1
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:33,007
Sayonara, motherfucker!

2
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:54,172
<i>We're going live.
Can you check on it?</i>

3
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:56,432
<i>Ten cars down, two to go.</i>

4
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:58,017
<i>These drivers are crazy.</i>

5
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,061
I still don't understand why they
are so willing to die.

6
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:02,647
Because everyone wants to
be king of the hill.

7
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:05,191
- Is it already streaming on the dark web?
- Yes, warden.

8
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:10,071
It is online in real time
on Freenet, I2P, and Tor.

9
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:13,449
There is no way to trace the ISP and
shut 'em down with a web based attack?

10
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:16,676
If I was the NSA and had a
couple months, maybe.

11
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,789
These guys are a
legitimate cyber militia.

12
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:23,834
The encryption is first ray,
it's bouncing every 10 seconds.

13
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:25,461
Then kill their power.

14
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:26,930
We don't supply their powering.

15
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,855
They are on their
own generator grid.

16
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:37,555
Take out this motherfucker.

17
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:45,622
Yeah baby!

18
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:53,004
Fuck you, Frank!

19
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,967
<i>Right now, get us in the 22.</i>

20
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:02,790
Any word from the OTP site?

21
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:06,919
On site and the online waging are up.
They are writing a lot of betting slips.

22
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:09,171
The house is banking cash
on the secondary racers

23
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:11,648
and the parlays,
and we are wrecking in some big.

24
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:13,634
Frankenstein wins...
There is a payout.

25
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:17,221
Death race is illegal
and bigger than ever.

26
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:19,515
Thanks to our resident
crazy man Frank.

27
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:20,850
Ah... Fuck Frankenstein,

28
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:23,728
You are the one who resurrected
Death race from the dead.

29
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:25,576
I just figured out how
to decode the satellite

30
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,356
signals and stream
it on the dark web.

31
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,026
Frankenstein has been born again,
thanks to us.

32
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,695
Oh... If he wins tonight, it'll
be his the seventh straight.

33
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,531
Oh, our contacts on the outside
says our margins are dropping

34
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:37,408
because nobody's taking the
other side of the bet.

35
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:39,493
We are losing a lot of
money on Frankenstein.

36
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:43,138
We need to spice things up.
The Parleys are paying off, but...

37
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:46,391
We need a challenger.

38
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:55,384
SWAT is on en route,
T minus five minutes.

39
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:59,779
Let's stop Frankenstein and
Death race down once and for all.

40
00:05:08,255 --> 00:05:10,566
We've got some action
from the outside.

41
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,835
You wanted to spice.
Say hello to SWAT.

42
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,344
Let's trace and pinch him.

43
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,514
Suck my dick, Frankie!

44
00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:29,502
Same my dick too, Frankie!

45
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:31,352
Push them into the fucking wall!

46
00:05:35,824 --> 00:05:37,066
Do it baby!

47
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,031
Mother fucker!

48
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,372
- Get off the wall!
- Damn it!

49
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,376
Take this motherfucker out!

50
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:59,756
I picked the wrong driver!

51
00:06:47,604 --> 00:06:50,723
Full house. Eight over Aces.

52
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,736
<i>Nice. Nines over jacks.</i>

53
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,204
I'd like a shot at
getting my money back.

54
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,837
Why don't I come to
your place later tonight?

55
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:28,002
Maybe we can shuffle
another deck of cards.

56
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,453
Esta bien.

57
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:36,494
Hey Jefe, I have got a player

58
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:38,339
who wants to play
some heavy action.

59
00:07:38,363 --> 00:07:40,967
On SWAT vs Frankenstein.

60
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:42,859
- SWAT?
- SWAT.

61
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:47,598
Who is he gonna play his money?

62
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:50,726
SWAT for a hundred thousand. Even odds.

63
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,022
My book. I'll fit the odd.

64
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:56,232
Three to one,

65
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:58,776
and if he gives you any push back,

66
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,420
tell him that Mexican Jew said,
go to hell and take his mom.

67
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:05,333
I hope they got their last shipment of guns.

68
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,342
Now make me some money, Frank.

69
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:45,698
<i>Frankenstein! Frankenstein!</i>

70
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:49,425
<i>Frankenstein! Frankenstein...</i>

71
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:09,320
<i>Forward.</i>

72
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:56,409
<i>To the left. All clear!</i>

73
00:09:57,085 --> 00:09:58,354
<i>Clear, sector one.</i>

74
00:09:58,378 --> 00:09:59,621
<i>Breach team, move out.</i>

75
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:11,424
Go, go, go!

76
00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:20,001
Hold up!

77
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:24,672
- Back it up.
- Go, go!

78
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:26,147
Tell me we got cameras in there?

79
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:29,109
Yeah, we have got
cameras everywhere.

80
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:33,037
Go left.

81
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:36,449
Left, clear.

82
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:42,455
Go right.

83
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:45,500
Go right, clear.

84
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:55,593
Two tango down!

85
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:04,795
<i>Sector two, report.</i>

86
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:07,480
<i>Copy that Foreman.</i>

87
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:11,385
<i>Spec ops, move.</i>

88
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:12,644
Got eyes on nothing.

89
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,618
Yeah motherfuckers, let's go.

90
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:29,122
Now we get a little!

91
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,477
Send me the best you got warden,

92
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:52,630
I'll send them back to you skinned,

93
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:54,564
gutted and quartered.

94
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:57,843
You may be in charge out there,
but this is my city.

95
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,694
This is the Sprawl!

96
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:13,374
<i>Get around the first corner.</i>

97
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,231
Hello?

98
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:19,156
This isn't gonna play well
in the Washington Post tomorrow.

99
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,741
I know, Mr Valentine.

100
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:22,549
Well, then you know
that I got Congress

101
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:24,579
at my ass about the
sprawl and morality.

102
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:26,622
Frankenstein is out of control,

103
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:28,374
his legion is growing.

104
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:30,626
The government is gonna
take back my prison

105
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,005
unless we shut down Frankenstein,
and shutting down now!

106
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:36,322
When I took over Weyland International

107
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:39,176
I was tasked with a
very specific directive.

108
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,096
Clean up the sprawl
and put an end to Frankenstein.

109
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,473
More importantly, Death race.

110
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:46,497
<i>Our contracts up in five years,
and we got a</i>

111
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:48,561
<i>lot of invest in that
human garbage dump.</i>

112
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:51,647
So when I get pulled in to a
congressional oversight committee

113
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:55,192
what should I say to the
435 members of the house?

114
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:57,111
Well, tell them that we're
doing our best, but...

115
00:14:57,135 --> 00:15:00,031
But what? We can't control a
bunch of sociopath gear heads,

116
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:01,696
and Frankenstein is
even more legendary

117
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:03,326
now the death race is illegal?

118
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,037
- I can handle Frankenstein, sir.
- Really?

119
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:07,119
Cause from where I see,

120
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:09,389
Frankenstein is making
you look like a chump.

121
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:12,251
He's gathering his team amounting
what adds up to a small army.

122
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:15,254
You can't shut him
down from the outside.

123
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,649
He's just a mask.
Anybody can wear the mask.

124
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:24,472
His disciples, inside and out, need to
see him suffer, humiliate in the feet.

125
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:27,350
He needs to die during death race,
and die bloody.

126
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:29,319
He loses Death Race,
he loses his power.

127
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,270
That's how you take back our prison.

128
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:33,496
Make it happen or I will.

129
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:43,741
What I'm about to feed you
is going to taste bitter.

130
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:48,287
You have found yourself
in a no win situation.

131
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:52,541
There are two options!
Die or survive.

132
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:55,113
You will not be given clothes.

133
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:57,129
What you're wearing
is what you'll wear.

134
00:15:57,153 --> 00:16:00,216
You will not be given
a place to sleep,

135
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,177
you will not be given jack shit,

136
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:06,389
except maybe
a bullet in the brain!

137
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:09,866
If you are lucky, rest assured,

138
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,911
there are no virgins
within these walls,

139
00:16:13,086 --> 00:16:18,150
because life has fucked you all.

140
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:24,156
<i>The sprawl is 88,000 acres
of bad shit about to happen.</i>

141
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:31,455
The containment zone warehouses
420,000 of the worst...

142
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:32,999
of the worst offenders.

143
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:39,020
Best advice, learn how to run.
Learn how to fight!

144
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:41,382
Stop eye fucking me, asshole.

145
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:48,097
Uncle Sam, has decided to provide
you with one roll of silver coin.

146
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:52,602
This will be your currency
inside the walls!

147
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:54,103
That's the hog wash!

148
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:59,541
Now, get yourselves ready,
we are appraching alpha bravo.

149
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:13,581
Go convicts, go, go!

150
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:17,100
Make the world a better place!
Get the fuck out of here!

151
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,172
How do I get in Death Race?

152
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:24,508
Find Baltimore Bob. If you got
what it takes, he will get you in.

153
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:27,193
Move, get off my bird now!

154
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,347
<i>Go!</i>

155
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:32,115
<i>What are you staring at? Come on!</i>

156
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:12,071
Who wants to play?

157
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:15,366
<i>Come here, you mother...</i>

158
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,076
On your knees!

159
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:20,815
Get the fuck on the
ground, for the fan.

160
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,957
<i>What is this shit?</i>

161
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:29,323
<i>Shut your fucking mouth!
Quit eyeballing me!</i>

162
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:31,883
Well, ain't this a rainbow,
or a fucking ugly?

163
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,429
- You folks lost?
- We're good.

164
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:39,224
You look lost.

165
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:41,252
No, we're good. Thanks.

166
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:43,645
You are good?

167
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:49,093
It's good.

168
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:51,095
Now give me your fucking silver.

169
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,695
Why would we do that?

170
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,725
It's a landing tax.

171
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:58,243
Why don't you just
shoot us and take it?

172
00:19:03,924 --> 00:19:06,784
Maybe I don't wanna
waste my bullets

173
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:09,129
on a gutter bitch like you.

174
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:17,345
You are a real sweet talker. Ain't you?

175
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:19,848
Thanks, I try.

176
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,892
I don't think you have any bullets.

177
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,099
In fact,

178
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,147
I think you are shooting blanks.

179
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:33,763
Okay.

180
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:35,962
You folks wanna play it the hard way?

181
00:19:36,162 --> 00:19:37,866
Up against the fucking truck!

182
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,616
Is this what you wanted?

183
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:34,297
I got this bad feeling,
I owe you pretty boy.

184
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:36,174
We are square.

185
00:21:24,147 --> 00:21:26,015
You the one, that gave
the cops a beating?

186
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:28,878
I don't want any trouble.

187
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,421
Oh, you don't?

188
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:32,965
Because if you tuned up the cops,
you are gonna have some.

189
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:35,275
I'm just looking for Baltimore Bob.

190
00:21:38,912 --> 00:21:40,613
Jump in, cowboy.

191
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:43,032
I'll give you a ride.

192
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,377
Fuck you, asshole.

193
00:23:18,803 --> 00:23:20,463
Fuck off, 'Tilly.

194
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:25,768
If I had a dick,
here is what I tell your ass to suck it.

195
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,790
So your story, is that one unarmed man

196
00:23:29,814 --> 00:23:31,524
took out you and your gang,

197
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:33,878
and pushed in my landing tax?

198
00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:35,963
I'm sorry, Frank.
I'll do better next time.

199
00:23:35,987 --> 00:23:39,133
There is no next time here in
the Sprawl, you know this.

200
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:42,902
You got sad here for killing cops,
and you can't handle one con?

201
00:23:43,203 --> 00:23:45,765
Like I said, I am sorry Frank.
I'll do better next time.

202
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:48,158
He just got lucky.

203
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:52,563
Every piece of silver you collect,
goes right back to the Sprawl.

204
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:56,416
When my landing tax goes
uncollected, the city suffers.

205
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:03,298
Do you like to suffer?

206
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:07,218
I don't like to suffer, Frank.

207
00:24:19,072 --> 00:24:21,816
That's him. That's the mother fucker!

208
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:28,782
- Hey, Bex.
- This guy is looking for Baltimore Bob.

209
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:32,270
'Course he is.

210
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:35,898
Connor Gibson, meet Jane.

211
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:37,624
It's good to meet you, Jane.

212
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:39,584
He is all yours, chica.

213
00:24:40,427 --> 00:24:43,296
I'mma go dance on the pole.

214
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,312
So,

215
00:24:46,912 --> 00:24:49,135
where's you moving from?

216
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:50,580
Long Beach.

217
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:52,180
What are you in it for?

218
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:54,307
Does it matter?

219
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:56,085
Does, for me.

220
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:58,770
I'm here because I'm here,
just like everyone else.

221
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,947
One of my tax collectors told me
you attacked him and then robbed him.

222
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:08,574
It's not exactly how it went down.

223
00:26:08,598 --> 00:26:10,326
Enlighten me, convict.

224
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,869
<i>Kill him Frank!</i>

225
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:13,871
Your boy and his pals
tried to jump me.

226
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:15,623
Yet you're the one who walked away.

227
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:17,458
I didn't say they were any good on it.

228
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:18,668
Let me whack him Frank.

229
00:26:18,692 --> 00:26:20,753
He's nothing but a couple of drops of

230
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:23,104
sprouted from a shit filled
crack in the sidewalk.

231
00:26:24,948 --> 00:26:26,691
Have we met before?

232
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:31,347
I don't think so.
I just got here.

233
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:35,184
And if we had, I wouldn't know.
You're hiding behind a mask.

234
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,884
This is my city.

235
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:39,939
No one speaks to me like that.

236
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:41,524
<i>Kill that motherfucker!</i>

237
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:44,527
Listen, you accuse me of stealing,
and I didn't steal anything.

238
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:47,048
I defended myself.

239
00:26:47,248 --> 00:26:50,298
It's not my fault your boys weren't
up to the fight they picked.

240
00:26:53,184 --> 00:26:54,886
Watch your back convict.

241
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,199
You're definitely
not from Long Beach.

242
00:27:19,127 --> 00:27:23,957
You're making a habit to punch
above your weight... Convict!

243
00:27:26,593 --> 00:27:28,461
Word is, you're looking for me.

244
00:27:29,262 --> 00:27:30,630
Baltimore Bob?

245
00:27:35,644 --> 00:27:38,471
Your balls must be
made out of titanium.

246
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:43,476
I've never seen anyone
talk to Frank like that.

247
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,107
You drive?

248
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:53,596
Yeah, I drive.

249
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,098
So, what are you in here for, Bob?

250
00:27:56,122 --> 00:27:59,227
Let's just say I help people transition.

251
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:01,222
Press called me Dr Kill.

252
00:28:01,422 --> 00:28:03,064
I was an oncologist.

253
00:28:03,088 --> 00:28:06,567
Yeah, I read about you.
You saved 400 dying people.

254
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:09,612
Yeah, 432, and not all
of 'em were dying.

255
00:28:09,636 --> 00:28:11,664
Some were living inconsequential lives,

256
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:13,840
and in as such they were already dead.

257
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,886
Come on, come on!

258
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:20,472
Get the truck!

259
00:28:28,154 --> 00:28:30,774
The food is property of Frankenstein!

260
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:32,260
What the hell are they doing?

261
00:28:32,284 --> 00:28:33,427
Feeding time.

262
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:34,720
Disciples of Frank.

263
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:37,515
They hijack the food shipments
and control the supply.

264
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:40,434
If you keep the populous hungry
they are easy to control.

265
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,395
Where do all the weapons
and cars come from?

266
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:45,147
Handmade, home-made,
we lick the bottom of the pad.

267
00:28:45,171 --> 00:28:47,066
And we salvage whatever
sticks to our tongues.

268
00:29:00,312 --> 00:29:03,431
Keep away from the meat,
all your motherfucker!

269
00:29:05,692 --> 00:29:07,727
Die, motherfucker!

270
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:11,815
Fuck you, Nazi fuck!

271
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:52,814
You are the one
everybody's talking about?

272
00:29:53,823 --> 00:29:55,343
News travels fast huh?

273
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:57,463
Small town, really.

274
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,306
Two hundred and twenty
six thousand to be exact.

275
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,946
We have about
19,000 deaths a year and...

276
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:04,701
22000 come over the wall.

277
00:30:05,752 --> 00:30:08,314
Sorry, I'm doing it again.

278
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:12,041
Connor Gibson, meet Lists.

279
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,365
So what am I watching here?

280
00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:20,660
It where the non-racers compete
for a spot in Death race.

281
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:21,953
How do you get a spot?

282
00:30:21,977 --> 00:30:23,803
You have to win the Death Match.

283
00:30:25,605 --> 00:30:28,683
Let the Death Match begin!

284
00:30:32,112 --> 00:30:36,217
Our first contestant is all the way
from New York City, New York.

285
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:41,138
She's a killer and a thief,
and one sexy little bitch of F.

286
00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:45,867
Give it up for Gipsy Rose!

287
00:30:52,465 --> 00:30:55,423
Next up, born in the tall corn and chicken

288
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:57,947
droppings of Oxford, Mississippi,

289
00:30:57,971 --> 00:30:59,907
- We have a psychotic...
- Who is the girl?

290
00:30:59,931 --> 00:31:01,075
Frank's main squeeze.

291
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:03,619
You know, standard guard
and parade pleasure model.

292
00:31:03,643 --> 00:31:06,789
Carley J'adore, it's her stage name.

293
00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:09,709
She was charged with
17 counts of human trafficking,

294
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:14,255
eight counts prostitution, and another
five counts of false imprisonment.

295
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,715
She is an ex cheerleader.

296
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:17,008
Ex porn star.

297
00:31:17,032 --> 00:31:18,509
Exactly.

298
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:20,777
Never did a day's work vertical.

299
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:32,857
On your mark,

300
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:35,708
Get set, and die!

301
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:25,034
<i>Kill, kill!</i>

302
00:32:25,058 --> 00:32:28,094
<i>Kill, kill!</i>

303
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:37,771
<i>- I can't hear you!
- Yes!</i>

304
00:33:29,497 --> 00:33:32,659
Shut your fucking...

305
00:35:32,037 --> 00:35:35,115
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

306
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,572
Don't pick a fight with Godzilla

307
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,906
because you think you
know how to throw a punch.

308
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:19,742
Sleep on it.

309
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:22,745
You still want death race tomorrow?

310
00:36:24,923 --> 00:36:26,207
We'll talk.

311
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:41,181
Hey, Long Beach.

312
00:36:42,148 --> 00:36:45,894
Got a bottle.
Could use some company.

313
00:36:48,488 --> 00:36:50,732
- Nice in here.
- Thanks.

314
00:36:53,785 --> 00:36:57,098
Go ahead and ask.
Everybody always ask.

315
00:36:57,122 --> 00:37:00,700
It's kind of like the
"what's your star sign" line in here.

316
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:06,664
I'm guilty.

317
00:37:07,382 --> 00:37:08,651
I wasn't gonna ask.

318
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:11,279
Yeah, which I would've
found out anyway.

319
00:37:11,303 --> 00:37:13,296
There's no secret
here in this Sprawl.

320
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:20,955
I married a really great guy,

321
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:24,474
who turned out to be
not such a great guy.

322
00:37:28,194 --> 00:37:31,132
He beat me up a couple of times.

323
00:37:31,156 --> 00:37:33,551
I forgave him.

324
00:37:33,575 --> 00:37:37,346
The market crashed,
he lost his job,

325
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,364
smacked me around a bit more.

326
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:44,369
I forgave him again.

327
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:49,692
And then one day,

328
00:37:49,716 --> 00:37:52,904
I didn't forgive him.

329
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:55,004
I shot him nine times.

330
00:37:57,641 --> 00:38:00,677
You know my one regret though?

331
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,183
That I didn't shoot the bastard ten.

332
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,066
Do you still wanna
not boots with me?

333
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,611
I never said I didn't.

334
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,853
Okay.

335
00:38:25,877 --> 00:38:28,246
Wasn't really out
for the taking anyway.

336
00:38:29,464 --> 00:38:32,265
I just needed somebody to
finish this bottle with.

337
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:35,070
and you're,

338
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:41,655
some... mysterious guy
from Long Beach, right?

339
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:44,596
Get some sleep.

340
00:38:47,232 --> 00:38:49,476
Couch is yours if you want it.

341
00:39:04,082 --> 00:39:05,768
<i>Welcome to the Green house.</i>

342
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:08,646
<i>This is Baltimore Bob's
one of a kind creation.</i>

343
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,324
Inspired by the Chinese Solar

344
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:12,749
greenhouse designs with CO2 enrichment.

345
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:17,128
Pesticide free,
and totally 100% organic.

346
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:20,241
This is where we
make the ethanol,

347
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:22,972
and Bob is constantly
tinkering with the recipe

348
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:24,996
to deliver a high-octane brew.

349
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,172
It's got 20 times more kick than the

350
00:39:27,372 --> 00:39:29,584
water downed petrol
from outside the wall.

351
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:33,254
He is like the OPEC of the Sprawl.

352
00:39:33,278 --> 00:39:36,132
And he is not in Frank's pocket?

353
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:37,800
They have an arrangement.

354
00:39:37,824 --> 00:39:39,886
He provides fuel,
and Frank...

355
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,807
reciprocate with some
protection and a few other parks.

356
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:47,742
We eat a little bit
better than the rest.

357
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:10,932
You slept on it?

358
00:40:11,483 --> 00:40:12,543
I did.

359
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:16,438
Let's say you have the skills.

360
00:40:20,242 --> 00:40:23,846
Death race is for
sociopaths, the killers.

361
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,724
You gotta have grumble in your guts.

362
00:40:26,748 --> 00:40:28,826
You have to live for the smell of,

363
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,978
motor oil and high octane fuel.

364
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:33,731
You gotta love the sound
of rubber on asphalt

365
00:40:33,755 --> 00:40:35,733
and taste of blood in your mouth.

366
00:40:35,757 --> 00:40:40,529
And when you go to sleep at night,
I mean that deep real sleep,

367
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:44,674
the sound of bullets wheezing past
your head should give you comfort.

368
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:48,845
So, Mr. Strong and Silent,

369
00:40:50,188 --> 00:40:51,806
you made of that stuff?

370
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:55,226
If I'm not, then I die, right?

371
00:40:59,197 --> 00:41:02,066
So you want a shot?

372
00:41:06,663 --> 00:41:09,684
I'm getting you a shot.

373
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,043
Tonight.

374
00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:12,911
Death Pit.

375
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,214
Be ready to fight!

376
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:39,422
<i>Welcome to the Dead Pit,
your degenerate convicts.</i>

377
00:41:39,446 --> 00:41:44,343
<i>Tonight the final death match promises
to be the bloodiest one yet.</i>

378
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,262
<i>The carnage is about to begin.</i>

379
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:50,865
<i>So take your seat and get ready
for the wildest ride yet.</i>

380
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:10,995
Hello?

381
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:12,038
Hi, old friend.

382
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,915
Lists, my buddy,
what do you got for me?

383
00:42:13,939 --> 00:42:15,416
There is a new guy.

384
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,253
This is his first death match, but
Baltimore Bob says, he can fight.

385
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:20,338
He could be a challenger.

386
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:21,422
What's his story?

387
00:42:21,446 --> 00:42:22,798
Connor Gibson,

388
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,218
in for felony whatever.

389
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,370
Two counts, six counts, who's counting?

390
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,638
He is in here with the rest of us.

391
00:42:28,662 --> 00:42:31,132
I wish I had a few more
bullet points for you but

392
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:32,516
he is a question mark.

393
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,315
Why don't you send me the link,

394
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:36,229
and I'll... Uh check him out.

395
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,314
Wait. Before you go,

396
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:42,026
<i>we are running short on spare parts,
bulk ammo, CAT 5 cable.</i>

397
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,319
Could you hook me up?

398
00:42:43,343 --> 00:42:45,483
- It will be on the next shipment.
- Adios Amigo!

399
00:42:47,055 --> 00:42:49,966
Okay, let's see what
this kid's made of.

400
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:52,844
Warden, check it out.

401
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,413
What do you have?

402
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:57,166
They are transmitting the
telecast from the death pit.

403
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:00,477
It's the final death match.

404
00:43:11,496 --> 00:43:15,184
Welcome to the final death match.

405
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:17,258
This one is simple easy.

406
00:43:18,753 --> 00:43:22,858
It's called "Capture the Keys".
Here is the rules.

407
00:43:22,882 --> 00:43:27,754
We are not here to see some
MMA submission bullshit.

408
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:32,342
We are here to see bone blasting.

409
00:43:33,226 --> 00:43:36,554
Spine shattering fun.

410
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:43,228
It's about kill.

411
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:50,428
It's about blood...
And bone.

412
00:43:50,452 --> 00:43:52,987
<i>Oh man, somebody's
gonna get a citation.</i>

413
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:57,575
We are not here to see
some fucking pussy tap out.

414
00:43:58,043 --> 00:44:01,913
The one person who
gets that set of keys.

415
00:44:02,255 --> 00:44:06,360
And sticks it in the ignition of that car.

416
00:44:06,384 --> 00:44:09,405
Wins the last spot in Death Race.

417
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:11,047
Yes!

418
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,719
Adios, suckers.
Peace out.

419
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,922
<i>Somebody call the police!</i>

420
00:46:20,518 --> 00:46:24,139
He is a challenger.
You can't teach that.

421
00:46:37,888 --> 00:46:39,154
Crush that motherfucker.

422
00:47:39,514 --> 00:47:42,535
That pretty boy can fight!

423
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,580
Yeah, but can he drive?

424
00:47:45,604 --> 00:47:49,959
Who cares, I want to know
if he fucks like he fights.

425
00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:52,143
Rip that motherfucker!

426
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:03,071
Yes!

427
00:48:37,072 --> 00:48:38,273
Fuck.

428
00:48:43,828 --> 00:48:47,490
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for the butcher.

429
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:51,854
This mountain human has a
tally full of killing under his belt.

430
00:48:51,878 --> 00:48:55,816
Having chalked up 67 body
bags on the kill board.

431
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,277
Submission is not his thing.

432
00:48:58,301 --> 00:49:00,394
Good luck out there, Connor.

433
00:49:00,594 --> 00:49:01,864
You got the keys,

434
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:05,717
do you have the balls?

435
00:49:06,685 --> 00:49:10,873
Side bet, this pretty boy
doesn't last a minute.

436
00:49:10,897 --> 00:49:12,724
I will take that.

437
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:11,619
Down goes Freezer!

438
00:51:11,643 --> 00:51:14,288
- Shit.
- Unbelievable.

439
00:51:14,312 --> 00:51:16,848
Ah! Made me feel young again. Shit!

440
00:51:45,218 --> 00:51:48,469
I got something for you, Frankenstein.

441
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:50,465
Got something for you baby.

442
00:51:55,437 --> 00:51:57,722
Bring the winner by for a talk.

443
00:51:58,231 --> 00:52:01,226
With pleasure.

444
00:52:04,779 --> 00:52:06,856
That's a bad motherfucker.

445
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:10,304
You wanna pay now or,
or shall I

446
00:52:10,504 --> 00:52:11,820
throw up on the tab?

447
00:52:13,788 --> 00:52:15,907
I'll pay now.

448
00:52:52,744 --> 00:52:55,572
Frank thought you
might want a fresh shirt.

449
00:52:57,624 --> 00:53:00,368
I thought you might want me.

450
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:03,955
I'm not into porn stars.

451
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,299
You can't pass this up.

452
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:20,930
I can.

453
00:53:28,113 --> 00:53:30,940
He might have something
to say about that.

454
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:51,770
If you think you can make a
go over against Frankenstein,

455
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:53,614
you're wrong.

456
00:53:53,638 --> 00:53:57,509
I can barely handle him and I
am three times the man you are.

457
00:54:07,569 --> 00:54:09,187
Pussy.

458
00:54:13,074 --> 00:54:15,803
Was Carley hospitable?

459
00:54:15,827 --> 00:54:17,612
Something like that.

460
00:54:18,538 --> 00:54:21,251
You have impressed me, twice.

461
00:54:21,451 --> 00:54:23,603
That's not easily done.

462
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:26,704
What were your first
impressions of the Sprawl?

463
00:54:27,005 --> 00:54:28,316
Anarchy.

464
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,527
Any more than the outside world?

465
00:54:31,551 --> 00:54:33,128
I think so.

466
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:43,805
Do you think you can handle
being king of this mountain?

467
00:54:45,774 --> 00:54:47,392
I'm just here to race.

468
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:52,590
Yes. But if you win?
Then what?

469
00:54:52,614 --> 00:54:56,526
Are you ready to lead?
To make hard decisions?

470
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:04,477
The sprawl is self-sustaining,
but it wasn't always this way.

471
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:07,454
When I arrived it was a wasteland.

472
00:55:07,879 --> 00:55:10,107
Weyland Corporation promote this sprawl

473
00:55:10,131 --> 00:55:12,443
as an alternative to
regular prisons.

474
00:55:12,467 --> 00:55:15,196
That was a lie.

475
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,619
The sprawl was created

476
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:19,299
as an alternative
to the death penalty.

477
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:24,247
They throw us cheese and
expect us to act like rats.

478
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:28,209
They did not expect us to evolve.

479
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:31,686
But we are, and we will.

480
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:35,857
I keep this place from anarchy.

481
00:55:35,991 --> 00:55:38,276
What does this have to do
with the street race?

482
00:55:38,493 --> 00:55:43,448
It's not just a street race,
It is who we are.

483
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:47,494
Who are you, Connor Gibson?

484
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,190
Nobody special.

485
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:53,908
Oh, that could change
if you wind death race,

486
00:55:54,108 --> 00:55:55,210
if you defeat me.

487
00:55:55,635 --> 00:55:59,005
Why would you be willing to risk losing
all this power?

488
00:55:59,306 --> 00:56:02,717
Death race gives anyone the
opportunity to become king.

489
00:56:03,101 --> 00:56:06,262
Without that to inspire,
we are nothing.

490
00:56:07,022 --> 00:56:10,683
If you win,
what would be your first act as king?

491
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,812
I haven't really thought about it.

492
00:56:14,362 --> 00:56:16,882
I won because I knew exactly

493
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,484
what I wanted to do when
I was king of this hill.

494
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:21,985
If you don't know what you ask,

495
00:56:22,085 --> 00:56:23,226
you will die on the track.

496
00:56:23,426 --> 00:56:25,657
And the Sprawl would
cheer your death.

497
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:27,560
So the question is...

498
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:30,078
What do you want?

499
00:56:55,528 --> 00:56:57,397
Come on baby, get in.

500
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,238
That was insane tonight.

501
00:57:05,914 --> 00:57:07,449
The answer is no, Bexie.

502
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:11,062
You don't wanna ride
shotgun in death race.

503
00:57:11,086 --> 00:57:13,746
Yes, I do.

504
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:15,691
It's a death sentence.

505
00:57:15,715 --> 00:57:18,147
Frank has killed people
I cared about.

506
00:57:18,347 --> 00:57:20,587
I want to be part of
putting him down.

507
00:57:28,228 --> 00:57:30,054
I'll think about it.

508
00:58:11,229 --> 00:58:13,473
I thought we could have a drink.

509
00:58:24,743 --> 00:58:26,152
So, who is Merry?

510
00:58:27,287 --> 00:58:28,786
Is she your favorite groupie,

511
00:58:28,886 --> 00:58:30,990
or you just really into Christmas?

512
00:58:32,834 --> 00:58:36,564
It's uh...
My sister, Meridith.

513
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:38,623
She died when I
was in the service.

514
00:58:41,301 --> 00:58:42,919
Never got to say goodbye.

515
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:46,131
Can't change it, so...

516
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:56,000
Seen a lot of bad stuff.
Done a lot of bad things.

517
00:58:56,024 --> 00:58:58,794
Merry was good.

518
00:58:58,818 --> 00:59:01,354
Better than me,
that's for sure.

519
00:59:05,325 --> 00:59:07,011
I was, uh...

520
00:59:07,035 --> 00:59:10,155
I was born in, Little Rock.

521
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:13,142
Son of a preacher man.

522
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:15,311
Hardly.

523
00:59:15,335 --> 00:59:18,856
My old man was a grease
monkey in a pair of

524
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,109
His idea of a good time was
drinking Dixie beer on the porch,

525
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:24,711
and, count the fireflies.

526
00:59:28,056 --> 00:59:29,878
Spent most of my young life in

527
00:59:30,078 --> 00:59:32,385
Sweet water, Texas,
on a salvage yard.

528
00:59:34,145 --> 00:59:38,501
Merry, passed away in Long Beach.

529
00:59:38,525 --> 00:59:40,560
So I ended up there.

530
01:00:11,266 --> 01:00:13,061
So, the good news is

531
01:00:13,261 --> 01:00:15,246
the V8 standard transmission
and it runs,

532
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:18,666
but the bad news is that
it needs tires, brakes

533
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:21,627
and toll engine over haul of it,
fuel cell, armor, weapon needed

534
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:26,356
Man, don't pull me with it, Lists.
Bottom line, it needs everything.

535
01:00:27,866 --> 01:00:29,192
What the hell is this thing?

536
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:31,262
Your tombstone.

537
01:00:31,286 --> 01:00:34,989
Bullet-proof titanium plate,
protects your fuel cell.

538
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:38,201
You got a navigator yet?

539
01:00:38,752 --> 01:00:41,121
Hell yeah, he does.

540
01:00:41,546 --> 01:00:44,374
I'm the motherfucker riding shotgun.

541
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,085
The hell you looking at?

542
01:00:47,427 --> 01:00:49,838
I got anti freeze in my brains.

543
01:00:51,264 --> 01:00:53,258
Let's build this shit.

544
01:02:27,485 --> 01:02:30,798
The speedometer has been calibrated
to 200 Miles per hour.

545
01:02:30,822 --> 01:02:32,232
Is that all she's got?

546
01:02:33,283 --> 01:02:34,692
Let's find out.

547
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:40,641
This Death race,
is one lap, one day.

548
01:02:40,665 --> 01:02:43,769
The race begins and
ends at the airfield.

549
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:46,454
Nice speed here, few obstacles.

550
01:02:51,176 --> 01:02:53,404
Second day, is on Interstate 94.

551
01:02:53,428 --> 01:02:57,283
Most of ballistic cars will be
taken out on this long stretch here.

552
01:02:57,307 --> 01:03:01,078
Watch out for the highway gang,
this is their turf.

553
01:03:01,102 --> 01:03:04,540
And then,
you hit the projects.

554
01:03:04,564 --> 01:03:07,183
All kind of bad boys' in there.

555
01:03:09,402 --> 01:03:11,156
You come out of there alive,

556
01:03:11,356 --> 01:03:13,799
you end up in the
Meatpacking District?

557
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,233
Home free.

558
01:03:17,452 --> 01:03:19,513
Driving is more important than killing.

559
01:03:19,537 --> 01:03:23,950
Shoot only when you must.
Think slow, drive fast.

560
01:03:25,252 --> 01:03:29,414
Rule no. 1, keep your ass alive.

561
01:04:11,923 --> 01:04:14,819
That was incredible.

562
01:04:14,843 --> 01:04:16,961
Don't fucking touch me.

563
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,751
Hi.

564
01:05:03,892 --> 01:05:05,718
So you like cars?

565
01:05:07,228 --> 01:05:08,940
Yeah.

566
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,015
I like American muscle.

567
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:15,338
I had a Vett.

568
01:05:15,362 --> 01:05:18,799
Rebuilt it myself.

569
01:05:18,823 --> 01:05:22,402
A 1970 LT-1.

570
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:25,556
Sting ray.

571
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:29,727
Used to love the opener
upon highway to Vegas.

572
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:34,523
Paddle to the floor, 370
horses running hard.

573
01:05:34,547 --> 01:05:37,121
Holley and Rochester Quadrajet Carb

574
01:05:37,321 --> 01:05:39,028
getting the mixture just right.

575
01:05:39,052 --> 01:05:40,929
Momentum shift,

576
01:05:41,129 --> 01:05:43,423
stay off the brakes,
get her on her toes.

577
01:05:45,225 --> 01:05:47,469
Man, could she fly.

578
01:05:48,603 --> 01:05:51,681
How about you talk like
this to all your girls?

579
01:05:56,194 --> 01:05:58,730
I got nothing outside these walls.

580
01:06:00,949 --> 01:06:04,360
Merry was my last connection
to anything real.

581
01:06:06,288 --> 01:06:08,031
So when she died

582
01:06:09,749 --> 01:06:12,979
I made a bad decision.

583
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:16,787
Wind up here, not caring
'bout anything

584
01:06:16,987 --> 01:06:18,057
or anyone.

585
01:06:25,056 --> 01:06:26,758
But now...

586
01:06:31,938 --> 01:06:33,681
But now?

587
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:09,971
<i>We come for you!</i>

588
01:09:24,277 --> 01:09:25,687
Sergeant Gibson.

589
01:09:26,613 --> 01:09:28,925
No one has called me that
in a long time.

590
01:09:28,949 --> 01:09:33,262
Connor Gibson, is not the
man we're coming to know.

591
01:09:33,286 --> 01:09:34,654
He is a warrior.

592
01:09:35,789 --> 01:09:39,644
A very decorated and
specialized warrior.

593
01:09:39,668 --> 01:09:42,142
Known in the shadow world of government

594
01:09:42,342 --> 01:09:44,690
killers for his wet work in the CIA.

595
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:49,294
Target and killing is his forte,
and I am his mark.

596
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:53,532
He is here at the behest
of Weyland International.

597
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:56,494
Sent here by the fascist from the outside,

598
01:09:56,518 --> 01:09:58,871
because they think I've
gained too much power.

599
01:09:58,895 --> 01:10:01,347
They fitted him with a strap,

600
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:04,768
and he hangs around their
waist like a hatchet.

601
01:10:05,735 --> 01:10:08,007
There is a helicopter
ride to freedom,

602
01:10:08,207 --> 01:10:10,356
waiting for him at the finish line.

603
01:10:10,532 --> 01:10:12,853
Tell me Sergeant,

604
01:10:13,053 --> 01:10:14,554
am I wrong?

605
01:10:14,578 --> 01:10:16,806
<i>Kill! Kill!</i>

606
01:10:24,671 --> 01:10:25,773
<i>Kill him!</i>

607
01:10:25,797 --> 01:10:27,733
Sergeant Gibson...

608
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:29,277
<i>Betrayer!</i>

609
01:10:29,301 --> 01:10:31,487
Will be allowed to race.

610
01:10:31,511 --> 01:10:34,198
Fuck that Frank?
What if he wins?

611
01:10:34,222 --> 01:10:38,802
Then he wins! And that
his words meant to be.

612
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:42,138
Did you think I
woudn't find out?

613
01:10:47,444 --> 01:10:51,022
So tell me,
who's hiding behind a mask now?

614
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:53,900
Me or you?

615
01:10:54,993 --> 01:10:57,403
See you on the starting line.

616
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:17,674
Is it true?

617
01:11:23,396 --> 01:11:25,140
Goodbye, Long Beach.

618
01:11:25,732 --> 01:11:27,016
Jane please.

619
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:32,939
Get your goddamn hands off me!

620
01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:45,285
I am still one of your pit crew.

621
01:11:45,794 --> 01:11:48,606
I don't care if they have
sent you to kill him.

622
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:50,456
He's a liar, Bob!

623
01:11:50,656 --> 01:11:52,109
A liar who is working for the

624
01:11:52,133 --> 01:11:53,626
Hey, get over it.

625
01:11:55,095 --> 01:11:57,255
He is good for business.

626
01:11:57,639 --> 01:11:59,632
We got a race to get ready for.

627
01:12:03,478 --> 01:12:06,347
Get your head right, convict.

628
01:12:08,275 --> 01:12:11,394
Your life depends on it.

629
01:13:09,002 --> 01:13:11,898
We got a long race day... Huh?

630
01:13:21,306 --> 01:13:23,842
Are you ready, mother fucker?

631
01:13:25,393 --> 01:13:29,055
I can't hear you,
you fucking pussies!

632
01:13:38,156 --> 01:13:40,108
Here they are!

633
01:13:45,038 --> 01:13:48,392
<i>Welcome to Death Race,
the ultimate auto carnage.</i>

634
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:50,937
<i>One day, eleven drivers,</i>

635
01:13:50,961 --> 01:13:55,691
<i>four stages,
and over 250 live cameras...</i>

636
01:13:55,715 --> 01:13:58,027
Just like clockwork, Mr. Valentine.

637
01:13:58,051 --> 01:14:01,989
This is it, last chance.
Frankenstein dies or your career dies.

638
01:14:02,013 --> 01:14:04,992
Frankenstein will be in a
body bag by day's end.

639
01:14:05,016 --> 01:14:07,218
I hope so for your sake.

640
01:14:11,564 --> 01:14:14,794
<i>Now talk about the bad boys and girls
who run this race.</i>

641
01:14:18,572 --> 01:14:23,234
<i>Featuring 3 time racer Johnny Law
and his monster police cruiser.</i>

642
01:14:23,368 --> 01:14:26,362
<i>He is here to protect and serve.</i>

643
01:14:26,871 --> 01:14:28,448
Morning, motherfuckers.

644
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:31,927
<i>Two time racer, the Fireman,
and his Dodge Ram Hemi.</i>

645
01:14:32,027 --> 01:14:34,772
<i>His ass is coming through your door.</i>

646
01:14:34,796 --> 01:14:36,456
Come show momma some love.

647

<i>And first timer Gipsy Rose

650
01:14:49,644 --> 01:14:52,039
<i>With a face only a mother could love,</i>

651
01:14:52,063 --> 01:14:55,308
<i>here's Pierced-Face

<i>Nazi Bastard and his

<i>Veteran Racer Dead man

656
01:15:16,129 --> 01:15:19,290
<i>He didn't come here
to rest in peace.</i>

657
01:15:19,466 --> 01:15:22,252
<i>Behind the wheel of her Toyota Celica,</i>

<i>And last,

660
01:15:28,808 --> 01:15:34,123
<i>Our resident rat fuck,
Sergeant Gibson and his Camero.</i>

<i>He has got bulls-eye
on his back.</i>

662
01:15:52,749 --> 01:15:54,200
You ready for our play date?

663
01:16:03,802 --> 01:16:05,860
You got the whole world
coming after you my man,

664
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:07,255
you know that right?

665
01:16:09,349 --> 01:16:12,036
Take a walk Bexie,
I got this.

666
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,903
I should.

667
01:16:14,103 --> 01:16:16,415
Who am I to judge?

668
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:19,934
I ain't here to
throw shade on you.

669
01:16:20,819 --> 01:16:23,730
You surely got reasons.

670
01:16:26,032 --> 01:16:29,944
So, if it's all the same,
I'll ride with you.

671
01:16:37,836 --> 01:16:40,606
<i>Now, give it up for your champion,</i>

672

<i>Frank, baby!</i>

676
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:19,228
Sometimes I get the feeling,
Frank is playing chess.

677
01:17:19,252 --> 01:17:22,189
And the rest of us
are playing checkers.

678
01:17:22,213 --> 01:17:24,295
Let her go, Frank.

679
01:17:24,495 --> 01:17:27,502
She's got nothing to
do with any of this.

680
01:17:27,529 --> 01:17:29,490
No,

681
01:17:30,102 --> 01:17:32,491
but she's a good insurance policy.

682
01:17:34,434 --> 01:17:37,178
Let's see how cold-blooded you are.

683
01:17:43,902 --> 01:17:45,437
Put her in the car.

684
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:48,341

690
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:24,684
We should fuck her after the race.

691
01:18:32,534 --> 01:18:34,402
Let's light this fire.

692

Now go back,

694

Ha-ha! Come on!

Dude, let's get this party started!

696

This is gonna be the
biggest payday ever.

Hey Bexie, do me a favor and

699
01:21:19,669 --> 01:21:21,361
get those motherfuckers off my ass.

700
01:21:25,707 --> 01:21:27,492
Let's blast some shit up!

701
01:21:44,809 --> 01:21:46,263
Find me someone
who can give me

702

some access on Connor Gibson.

703
01:21:48,438 --> 01:21:50,625
And tell him I'm all in.

<i>Nine drivers remain

<i>Frankenstein, Connor Gibson

707
01:21:59,574 --> 01:22:01,344
<i>and we are just

708
01:22:01,368 --> 01:22:04,070
<i>Stage two,

709
01:22:19,678 --> 01:22:20,879
Yeah!

710
01:22:38,488 --> 01:22:41,733
You're going down, you
sodomite motherfucker!

711
01:22:43,285 --> 01:22:44,652
Take him out!

712
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,120
Fuck you, Fireman!

713
01:23:13,023 --> 01:23:14,307
Yeah!

714
01:23:32,459 --> 01:23:35,036
Now that's a waste
of some good pussy!

715
01:23:35,754 --> 01:23:38,107
I couldn't have said it better myself.

716
01:23:38,131 --> 01:23:40,499
Frankenstein and the
Benedict Arnold himself,

717

Connor Gibson, battle for the lead.

718
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:45,505
Gipsy Rose and Johnny Law
hanging around the front of the path.

719
01:23:49,559 --> 01:23:52,288
Let's put Frank in a body bag
once and for all.

720
01:23:52,312 --> 01:23:53,555
Arming missiles.

721
01:23:54,356 --> 01:23:57,501
Let's see if your boyfriend's
ready to bury you.

722
01:23:57,525 --> 01:23:58,544
Don't do it.

723
01:23:58,568 --> 01:24:01,631
Let her go, Connor. That skinny
bitch ain't never coming back.

724
01:24:01,655 --> 01:24:02,939
I said, don't do it.

725
01:24:09,204 --> 01:24:11,197
Just what I thought.

726
01:24:50,829 --> 01:24:52,655

727
01:24:56,918 --> 01:24:58,203
Fuck!

728
01:25:00,005 --> 01:25:01,956
Suck on this!

729
01:25:18,231 --> 01:25:20,517
Hold onto your teddies, bitches!

730
01:25:34,956 --> 01:25:36,908
Six death racers left.

731
01:25:40,078 --> 01:25:42,064
- Go ahead!
- Let's go!

732
01:25:42,088 --> 01:25:46,277
Who the hell brings a
VW bus in a Death Race?

733
01:25:46,301 --> 01:25:48,029
You gotta hand it to these degenerates.

734
01:25:48,053 --> 01:25:49,712
They put on a hell of a show.

735
01:26:08,531 --> 01:26:10,300
Our tombstone can't
hold out much longer.

736

<i>Somebody call the 911!</i>

737
01:26:25,382 --> 01:26:26,624
Lose this psychopath.

738
01:26:43,942 --> 01:26:45,852
Missed motherfucker!

739
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:01,686
Fish on!

740
01:27:01,710 --> 01:27:02,911
We are hooked.

741
01:27:05,922 --> 01:27:08,082
Hang on, Bexie,
I got an idea.

742
01:27:20,854 --> 01:27:23,932
What are you doing, motherfucker?

743
01:27:43,084 --> 01:27:45,646
Yeah, fishy fishy.

744
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:49,582
Come out and play.

745
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:38,865
<i>Fuck me, this traitor
and his bitch, Bexie,</i>

746
01:28:39,065 --> 01:28:40,868
<i>just burnt down the Fireman.</i>

747
01:28:40,892 --> 01:28:43,829
<i>Only five death racers left
to seem heading to the projects.</i>

748
01:28:43,853 --> 01:28:47,250
<i>Frankenstein is still in the lead,
with Gipsy Rose up close second,</i>

749
01:28:50,527 --> 01:28:53,271
<i>Stage three,
the project.</i>

750
01:29:27,272 --> 01:29:28,681
Fucking Death Race!

751
01:30:06,978 --> 01:30:08,763
Hey, you!

752
01:30:09,564 --> 01:30:11,141
Did you do this?

753
01:30:11,691 --> 01:30:15,046
No, we did!

754
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:17,730
Just the man I was gunning for.

755
01:30:19,616 --> 01:30:21,818
How you doing, Wonder Bread?

756
01:30:23,578 --> 01:30:25,572
<i>You stupid motherfucker!</i>

757
01:30:28,041 --> 01:30:30,186
Fick ditch, Schwarzer!

758
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:32,230
Oh, no, he didn't?

759
01:30:32,254 --> 01:30:34,398
Did he just say
what I think he said?

760
01:30:34,422 --> 01:30:37,125
Yeah,
but in German.

761
01:30:40,762 --> 01:30:44,174
You and your bitch,
brought your shit,

762
01:30:44,641 --> 01:30:47,051
to the wrong part of town.

763
01:30:49,771 --> 01:30:51,639
Get ready to play.

764
01:31:29,019 --> 01:31:31,038
We gotta re route him
over the bridge.

765
01:31:31,062 --> 01:31:32,972
He is too far out to win this race.

766
01:31:33,815 --> 01:31:35,084
I'm not telling him.

767
01:31:35,108 --> 01:31:36,768
Get him on line.

768
01:31:38,612 --> 01:31:39,839
Talk to me Bob.

769
01:31:39,863 --> 01:31:41,841
We need to re route you
over the bridge.

770
01:31:41,865 --> 01:31:42,925
The bridge is out.

771
01:31:42,949 --> 01:31:44,635
Why the fuck you
re routing me there?

772
01:31:44,659 --> 01:31:47,346
You are too far behind,
You have to jump the gap.

773
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:49,682
What are we talking about,
like 50 feet?

774
01:31:49,706 --> 01:31:52,018
More like 250 feet.

775
01:31:52,042 --> 01:31:54,061
That's your only chance
if you wanna win.

776
01:31:54,085 --> 01:31:55,328
I have to win.

777
01:32:18,777 --> 01:32:22,840
<i>No one's gonna cite a cheer for Nazi
Bastard and his nasty little Fraulein.</i>

778
01:32:22,864 --> 01:32:26,969
<i>I mean, hu hu, it's not a
real loss to the planet earth.</i>

779
01:32:26,993 --> 01:32:28,638
<i>Four drivers remain.</i>

780
01:32:28,662 --> 01:32:31,474
<i>Frankenstein and Gipsy Rose
taken up a big lead</i>

781
01:32:31,498 --> 01:32:33,950
<i>on Johnny Law and Connor Gibson.</i>

782
01:32:51,476 --> 01:32:53,287
So, how do we do this, Bob?

783
01:32:53,311 --> 01:32:56,875
You gotta hit the gap
at 220 miles an hour.

784
01:32:57,075 --> 01:32:58,084
There is a ramp there.

785
01:32:58,108 --> 01:33:00,169
Not the first time
this has been tried.

786
01:33:00,193 --> 01:33:02,922
No, we are only calibrated
to 200 miles an hour.

787
01:33:02,946 --> 01:33:04,674
Don't worry,
should get you up to 220.

788
01:33:04,698 --> 01:33:06,399
Anyone ever made this jump before?

789
01:33:07,117 --> 01:33:09,986
On paper, the math works.

790
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:16,352
What about the landing?

791
01:33:16,376 --> 01:33:18,479
I ain't gonna lie to you,
it's gonna be a hard one.

792
01:33:18,503 --> 01:33:21,524
If you get your angle
right, you might live.

793
01:33:21,548 --> 01:33:23,249
Yeah, fuck you very much.

794
01:33:25,427 --> 01:33:27,504
That rat fuck is back.

795
01:33:37,272 --> 01:33:38,890
Punk ass bitch!

796
01:33:45,572 --> 01:33:46,773
That worked well.

797
01:34:04,007 --> 01:34:05,792
Yeah!

798
01:34:08,803 --> 01:34:11,965
Okay! Let's get this done already.

799
01:34:14,726 --> 01:34:17,163
To your next left, the
bridge is five miles out.

800
01:34:17,187 --> 01:34:18,247
This is your only chance.

801
01:34:18,271 --> 01:34:19,764
You like this play, Bob?

802
01:34:20,565 --> 01:34:21,626
It's your only play.

803
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:23,393
I'll see you on the other side.

804
01:34:31,493 --> 01:34:33,636
You should get out, Bexie.

805
01:34:33,836 --> 01:34:35,155
We are at end of the road.

806
01:34:35,997 --> 01:34:37,991
Not fucking happening.

807
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:41,119
The minute I got in this car with you,
I was all in.

808
01:34:43,004 --> 01:34:45,151
So let's do this.

809
01:34:45,851 --> 01:34:47,625
It's just gravity.

810
01:35:04,693 --> 01:35:06,295
We maxed it out at 209.

811
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:07,729
I'm dropping the tombstone.

812
01:35:36,308 --> 01:35:38,343
Come on! Come on!

813
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:40,556
Yes!

814
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:43,100
Yes! Yes! Yes!

815
01:36:43,124 --> 01:36:44,784
I told you the math worked.

816
01:36:49,005 --> 01:36:50,957
I could suck you off right now.

817
01:36:54,886 --> 01:36:56,530
I can't believe what I just saw.

818
01:36:56,554 --> 01:36:59,867
Connor Gibson jumped the bridge
cutting in right back in

819
01:36:59,891 --> 01:37:02,886
Motherfucker got game.

820
01:37:03,979 --> 01:37:07,974
Come on, don't let me down.
You have got to win this race.

821
01:37:19,327 --> 01:37:21,279
Here comes your boyfriend.

822
01:37:22,706 --> 01:37:25,074
Bex, patch me through to Frank.

823
01:37:32,674 --> 01:37:34,000
Hey Frankie.

824
01:37:34,384 --> 01:37:37,905
Hey, Connor, glad you show up
for your date with destiny.

825
01:37:37,929 --> 01:37:40,032
I knew it would come down to us.

826
01:37:40,056 --> 01:37:42,008
I wouldn't have it any other way.

827
01:37:43,101 --> 01:37:45,637
We can start shooting
at each other, or we can drive.

828
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:47,248
What do you prefer?

829
01:37:47,272 --> 01:37:48,681
Let's drive.

830
01:37:57,449 --> 01:38:00,401
<i>Stage four,
meat packing district.</i>

831
01:38:16,943 --> 01:38:20,255
C'mon! We are running out of time,
take him out already.

832
01:38:32,901 --> 01:38:34,060
What's going on?

833
01:38:35,695 --> 01:38:36,839
<i>FUEL LEVEL</i>

834
01:38:36,863 --> 01:38:38,440
<i>SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS</i>

835
01:38:39,157 --> 01:38:40,567
His fuel cell is empty.

836
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:51,411
What the fuck?
Drive, Connor!

837
01:38:53,797 --> 01:38:55,290
We are out of gas.

838
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:18,438
The fuel line is ruptured.

839
01:39:58,194 --> 01:40:01,005
Don't do it. Just...

840
01:40:01,205 --> 01:40:02,941
Turn around and win your race.

841
01:40:04,075 --> 01:40:07,487
This is Death Race.
He has to die.

842
01:40:09,331 --> 01:40:11,658
He knows it.

843
01:40:12,626 --> 01:40:14,536
He chose it.

844
01:41:16,982 --> 01:41:18,766
Alright!

845
01:41:22,654 --> 01:41:24,632
That's our queue,
send in the chopper.

846
01:41:24,656 --> 01:41:26,232
It's already on route.

847
01:41:34,624 --> 01:41:36,075
Get the fuck outta here.

848
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,539
I got you,
I got you, Jane.

849
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:47,154
Jam the broadcast to the dark web.

850
01:41:47,178 --> 01:41:48,990
But, this is good stuff...

851
01:41:49,014 --> 01:41:51,090
Just do it!
Cut it for five minutes.

852
01:41:55,895 --> 01:41:57,555
Oh shit.

853
01:42:01,151 --> 01:42:04,797
This is what the warden wants.

854
01:42:04,821 --> 01:42:07,107
He wants Frank's death on display.

855
01:42:07,699 --> 01:42:12,054
We give it to him, we'll lose.

856
01:42:12,078 --> 01:42:13,488
Fuck him.

857
01:42:30,347 --> 01:42:32,674
The job's done,
let's go!

858
01:42:33,934 --> 01:42:35,510
Hold on.

859
01:42:43,068 --> 01:42:44,879
They send two of us?

860
01:42:44,903 --> 01:42:47,001
Insurance.

861
01:42:48,517 --> 01:42:49,858
Pretty well, huh?

862
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,235
And thanks for the assist.

863
01:42:53,036 --> 01:42:56,265
Everyone was so focused on
you, I flew under the radar.

864
01:42:56,289 --> 01:42:59,101
Let's get the fuck
out of this shit hole.

865
01:42:59,125 --> 01:43:02,829
Frankenstein is dead,
job well done.

866
01:43:06,925 --> 01:43:08,585
Oh and by the way...

867
01:43:10,011 --> 01:43:12,297
We are all square now.

868
01:43:14,599 --> 01:43:17,510
20 seconds and I'm gone.

869
01:44:07,027 --> 01:44:09,187
<i>Connor, listen up.</i>

870
01:44:09,613 --> 01:44:12,899
Put on the mask,
become Frankenstein.

871
01:44:13,241 --> 01:44:16,596
The sprawl, will never
follow Connor Gibson.

872
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:19,640
They follow Frankenstein.

873
01:44:19,664 --> 01:44:21,430
Without him,

874
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:23,736
chaos.

875
01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:54,816
Let's finish this race, Long Beach.

876
01:46:17,032 --> 01:46:21,111
Now, put death race,
back on live.

877
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:25,695
Goldberg is gonna be pissed.

878
01:46:25,895 --> 01:46:27,894
He put heavy action on Connor.

879
01:46:27,918 --> 01:46:29,828
Easily come, easy go.

880
01:46:36,259 --> 01:46:38,169
Fuck you, Valentine.

881
01:46:40,582 --> 01:46:45,556
Subtitled by Clarity.

882
01:46:52,817 --> 01:46:54,018
Yeah!

883
01:46:57,447 --> 01:46:58,696
<i>Yeah!</i>
