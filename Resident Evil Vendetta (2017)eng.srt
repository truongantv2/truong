1
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,045
<i>When I was a kid,...</i>

2
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,695
<i>...I used to think about
the kind of man...</i>

3
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,415
<i>...I'd grow up to be.</i>

4
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:55,114
<i>I never thought my life
would turn out this way.</i>

5
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,239
So you're Chris Redfield.

6
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,190
The expert on the living dead.

7
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,810
The big hero.

8
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,214
Bet you killed a lot, huh?

9
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,597
So, Mr. Expert,...

10
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,299
...any advice
on dealing with them?

11
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,087
Yeah.

12
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,257
You got friends?
Heh, heh.

13
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,459
Sure. I got friends.

14
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,328
Family? Yeah.

15
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,864
Got a wife. My folks.

16
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,399
A little sister.

17
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,605
There's corporations
out there creating viruses...

18
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,308
...turning people
into bioweapons.

19
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,410
People like you and me.

20
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,780
Your friends. Family.

21
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:05,217
There will come a day when
you'll be faced with a decision.

22
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,751
Kill them...

23
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,454
...or be killed.

24
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,257
Doesn't sound
very heroic, does it?

25
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,531
Sorry.

26
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,818
We're approaching the target,
so let's go over everything...

27
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:27,066
...one more time
so there's no mistakes.

28
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,442
The target is Glenn Arias.

29
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,926
He's wanted internationally
for weapons trafficking.

30
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,880
And we're not talking
about M16s and IEDs here.

31
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,283
We're talking
cutting-edge shit.

32
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,551
He likes doing business...

33
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,334
...anywhere there's
a major conflict.

34
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,290
Intel says that Arias is now
in possession of a B.O.W.,...

35
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:49,327
...a.k.a. bioorganic weapon.

36
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,278
That's why
the BSAA is here.

37
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,526
They know
how to handle those things.

38
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,516
One of our undercover agents,
Cathy White,...

39
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,771
...went missing weeks ago,
along with her son, Zack.

40
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,521
We have
two objectives today:

41
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,974
Find them...

42
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,410
...and grab Glenn Arias.

43
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,358
Comm check.

44
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,760
<i>No movement outside
the compound.</i>

45
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,429
Split up into three teams.

46
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,864
We're going in.

47
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,465
Clear.

48
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,758
Jesus.

49
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,045
Are you okay?

50
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,158
Go!

51
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,374
Zack?

52
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,876
Yeah.

53
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,947
Go!

54
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,942
Redfield, come in.

55
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,680
Anybody.
What the hell's going on?

56
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,724
Emergency evac.
Get the chopper now.

57
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,278
Get out of here!

58
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,462
Arias.

59
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:55,192
Thanks to you, I'll have to move
my business somewhere else.

60
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,962
You son of a bitch.

61
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,264
Please.

62
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,601
I'm a businessman.

63
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:07,972
I make good products available
to anyone who wants to buy.

64
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,108
And at reasonable prices.

65
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,178
For example, this...

66
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,613
...exquisite specimen.

67
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,961
Cathy.

68
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,031
Bastard.

69
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,933
The last moments on Earth...

70
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,069
...are the most beautiful,
don't you think?

71
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,438
The wonderful thing
about my products...

72
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,974
...is that they know
the difference between ally...

73
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,295
...and enemy.

74
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,404
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations.

75
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,410
No!

76
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,877
This is all for you, my dear.

77
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,483
My Sara.

78
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,290
Is that it?

79
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,426
Is that the virus
that's making everyone flip out?

80
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,561
Yes.

81
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,797
It keeps getting
worse and worse.

82
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,367
Attacks are happening
all over the place.

83
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,870
Where'd
you get this?

84
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,854
I haven't seen
this footage before.

85
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,308
It hasn't
been released yet.

86
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,777
They don't want
the public to panic.

87
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,512
Are you kidding me?

88
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,682
There's been like 20 attacks
in the U.S. already.

89
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,418
The BSAA is working
to keep it under control, but...

90
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,335
But it'll
just keep happening...

91
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,989
...until we find
the cause and stop it, right?

92
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,592
Exactly.

93
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,827
This is being done
intentionally.

94
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,630
If we can just find out
who's behind it...

95
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,232
Caramel macchiato?

96
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,367
Did you remember
the chocolate chips?

97
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,950
And the whipped cream
on top.

98
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,871
Good boy.

99
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:16,840
That's dessert, not coffee.
You know that, right?

100
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,476
Your point?

101
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,346
Nothing. Nothing at all,
Professor Chambers.

102
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:36,560
The dead coming back to life
and being used as bioweapons.

103
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,477
These insane corporations
have caused...

104
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,746
...far too much tragedy
in this country.

105
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,515
You think this is
more of the same, then?

106
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,035
I don't know.

107
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,538
Based on
what's happened before,...

108
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:50,040
...this time it feels different.

109
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,744
Someone new
could be behind it.

110
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,479
Is that the vaccine simulation?

111
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,716
The infected are exhibiting...

112
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,432
...different traits
this time around.

113
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,634
I'm attempting to suppress
the artificial virus...

114
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,422
...because it seems
to be the base of the infection.

115
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,525
I saw the computational
chemistry system running.

116
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,309
Are we making
a test drug already?

117
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,729
Of course.

118
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,645
Our technology's come so far
over the years,...

119
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,665
...making a sample
doesn't take that long.

120
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,536
Oh, by the way,...

121
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,673
...we got another delivery
of infected bodies.

122
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,409
A lot.
More than 30.

123
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,010
Who's getting the samples?

124
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,880
The students
are all out today.

125
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,448
And...?

126
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,986
Oh, no. I'm postdoc.
I don't do that.

127
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,959
Fine. Anything you say,
Professor Chambers.

128
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,696
My hero.

129
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,099
What the...?

130
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,284
Aaron.

131
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,020
No.

132
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,320
Why? Why now?

133
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,922
Here?

134
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,313
It's like
it was planned.

135
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,477
Rebecca.

136
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,080
Chris?
You all right?

137
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,364
It's been a while.

138
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:12,969
You should be wearing
a clean-suit or at least a mask.

139
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,405
Yeah, well...

140
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,074
How you doing?

141
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,211
I'm fine for now.

142
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,380
But shouldn't I be
in quarantine?

143
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,450
Look...

144
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,868
if the virus really
was that contagious,...

145
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,322
...we'd all be dead already.

146
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:36,359
Besides, quarantine takes
too long, and I need you now.

147
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,295
So don't worry.

148
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,103
We'll get you to a hot shower,
and everything will be okay.

149
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,902
Same old Chris.

150
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,240
<i>Police reports say
the suspects</i>

151
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,075
<i>were armed terrorists.</i>

152
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,426
<i>So far, the number of dead
is reported to be over...</i>

153
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:58,181
<i>The mass killing in this town
outside of Chicago is under...</i>

154
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:03,053
<i>Sudden outbreak of violence
claimed many victims today.</i>

155
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,337
<i>Ontario's special task force
has declared</i>

156
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:08,525
<i>the situation under control.
While that might be</i>

157
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,475
<i>the official statement
on the incident...</i>

158
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,262
It's me.

159
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:24,074
That doesn't look like
you're resting.

160
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,700
A hot shower
does wonders.

161
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,230
Is that the data you
took from the lab? Yes.

162
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,318
Now that we know the test drug
works as a vaccine,...

163
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,254
...we have to send this out
to other labs ASAP.

164
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,472
The faster
we get this mass-produced,...

165
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,459
...the more lives we can save.

166
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,928
Yeah, maybe.

167
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,165
There's a reason you're here,
isn't there?

168
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,401
You're after someone.

169
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,404
Yeah, a man
named Glenn Arias.

170
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,639
Who's that?

171
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,609
He took over Neo Umbrella
and Tricell's operations.

172
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,012
He's selling the weapons
they created...

173
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,114
...to crime syndicates
and countries at war.

174
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,249
He's a merchant of death...

175
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,619
...using mercenaries and B.O.W.s
to do his dirty work.

176
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,654
And now...

177
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,557
...the dead are rising again.

178
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:17,275
And you're sure
Arias is behind it?

179
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,263
Yes. After I found out
that your research...

180
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,980
...was the most advanced
in the world...

181
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,068
You hopped on a chopper
and came to see me.

182
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,436
Yes.

183
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,972
And after I saw
how trashed your lab was,...

184
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,242
...it looks like the bad guys knew
about your research too.

185
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:36,279
Oh...I reported our initial
findings to the WHO.

186
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,363
And then they sent it
to facilities...

187
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,251
...all over the world
that specialize in vaccines.

188
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,514
The leak could've come
from any of those places.

189
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,022
Exactly.

190
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,039
Arias wanted
to disrupt your research.

191
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,787
And now that he's got your data,
he's even more dangerous.

192
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,247
I compared
the new virus's DNA...

193
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,750
...to all the bioweapons
we have on file.

194
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,638
The sequence is extremely close
to the parasitic weapons...

195
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:05,542
...used by
the Los Iluminados cult.

196
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:08,078
You think Arias
might be one of'em?

197
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:11,381
Based on information I have now,
I'm not sure.

198
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,220
Looks like we should go talk
to a real expert.

199
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,322
Real expert?

200
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,140
I can't believe you can read
a book at a time like this.

201
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,312
I guess it's one way
to pass the time.

202
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:47,183
Well, someone once said,
"Knowledge is power."

203
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,718
Francis Bacon.

204
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:55,258
It only takes one bullet
to bring your enemy down.

205
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:58,462
But with knowledge,
you can defeat all evil.

206
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,100
Hey, is it true
what they say?

207
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:07,504
You switched from special ops
to science geek?

208
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:13,610
Man, the BSAA's chock-full
of people with weird résumés.

209
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:17,080
Bet you were pretty brainy
to start with.

210
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,749
So why'd you switch?

211
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,685
That's a story.

212
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,457
I used to be a medic in the
S.T.A.R.S. Unit in Raccoon City.

213
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,125
I guess, in a way,

214
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,209
I've always been
interested in medical science.

215
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,511
Then one day,
I decided to make it my duty

216
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:36,199
to stop people
from abusing it.

217
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,202
<i>"I thought, "Here are
these corporations,</i>

218
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,838
<i>run by scum,
preying on the weak."</i>

219
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,741
<i>They're like
a disease on humanity.</i>

220
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,610
<i>I want to find a cure,
same as Chris.</i>

221
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:52,448
<i>The difference is, he uses
his brawn while I use my brain.</i>

222
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,718
So brains and brawns working
together to save humanity.

223
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,390
What do you think
your chances are?

224
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:01,139
What's that supposed to mean, Damian?
Nothing.

225
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,261
It's just, like, uh, what if
this disease don't got no cure?

226
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:08,798
The assholes we're after,
they treat life and death...

227
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,633
...like they shooting craps.

228
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,635
Bunch of dicks.

229
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,638
Hey, I just realized
D.C. and Damian...

230
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,256
...aren't talking
about<i> Breaking Bad</i> for once.

231
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:21,377
Hey, don't go there, Chris.
That shit's ahead of its time.

232
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,346
It's a goddamn masterpiece.

233
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,616
Careful you don't
scare the locals.

234
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,751
Your stealth's for shit.

235
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,468
It's a little early to be
that deep in the bottle, Leon.

236
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,725
Well, look who it is.

237
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,829
The BSAA's golden boy
and Dr. High Hopes.

238
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,564
What the hell do you want?

239
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,567
I got a job.
We need your help.

240
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,937
I'm on vacation.

241
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,708
Let's talk about
Los Iluminados.

242
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,911
Remember the type
of B.O.W.s they were using?

243
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:32,248
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

244
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,798
So what, you just gonna
sit around here...

245
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,533
...another week
and do nothing?

246
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:39,222
I never make plans
that far ahead.

247
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,792
Hey. Another bottle here.
Cancel that.

248
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,695
Hey, who the hell do you...?
Enough! All right?

249
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:50,967
What do you want,
Redfield?

250
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:54,404
What do you want, Leon?
Heh.

251
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,741
Cut the shit.

252
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,243
Guys, come on.

253
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,712
Leon, I'm sorry...

254
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,414
...to interrupt your vacation,...

255
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,883
...but we wouldn't be here
if it wasn't serious.

256
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:10,253
We think you might have
some intel, and we need it now.

257
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,392
What intel?

258
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,409
<i>Second target confirmed.</i>

259
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,479
She stays alive.

260
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,314
Finish the rest.

261
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,250
<i>Copy that.</i>

262
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,732
Look, this shit's
spreading fast and thick.

263
00:38:55,767 --> 00:39:00,002
All of the researchers and staff
at my university were infected.

264
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,240
This again, huh?

265
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,424
It's like I'm stuck
in a goddamn loop.

266
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:09,679
What?
What are you talking about?

267
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,749
You know that bomb
that went off in D.C.?

268
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,239
Well, it was my mission
to stop the terrorists.

269
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:18,870
We got to
our rendezvous point...

270
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,027
...and some asshole
ratted us out.

271
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,095
<i>The bomb went off
and everyone on Metro SWAT,</i>

272
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,766
<i>my whole unit, gone.</i>

273
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:33,636
<i>I keep fighting
and fighting, and fighting.</i>

274
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,553
<i>And instead of seeing an end
to this shit,</i>

275
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,007
<i>it just keeps getting worse.</i>

276
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,076
Is this what
my life's supposed to be?

277
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:45,548
Fighting the living dead
and the bastards that make'em?

278
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,517
What's the point of it all?

279
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,552
Look...

280
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,136
This is Glenn Arias,
an arms dealer.

281
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,505
His deals
on the black market are so shady

282
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,298
they landed him on a certain
government's hit list.

283
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,111
<i>A smart bomb was dropped
on his wedding.</i>

284
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,999
<i>He lost
his family and his wife.</i>

285
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,668
<i>And now he's got a grudge.</i>

286
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,019
<i>After the attack,
he went underground,</i>

287
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,375
<i>but now he's back with B.O.W.s
and a score to settle.</i>

288
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,977
<i>He said his products</i>

289
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,814
<i>have targeting
capabilities.</i>

290
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:21,017
<i>From what I've seen,
I believe him.</i>

291
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:26,088
So you got
an arms dealer on one side,...

292
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:27,957
...and on the other,...

293
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,827
...a government
dropping bombs on weddings.

294
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,479
Who's the bad guy here?
Arias!

295
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,614
And it's our mission
to bring his ass down!

296
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,168
Your mission, not mine!
Goddamn it, Leon!

297
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,471
Stop! Leon.

298
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:43,187
With everything
that's going on,...

299
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,808
...you just sit here
and feel sorry for yourself.

300
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:49,579
And you? You're letting
a grudge get the better of you.

301
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,515
God...

302
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,884
I cannot believe
how alike you two are.

303
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,752
What are you talking about?

304
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,589
You're acting like a couple
of selfish brats right now.

305
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,909
The virus
is right under our noses.

306
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,144
Always has been.

307
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,714
I don't follow.

308
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:27,149
We don't need
to look for some new virus...

309
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:30,119
...that Arias
is infecting people with.

310
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:34,056
The virus is lying dormant
inside of everyone.

311
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,025
Even you.

312
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,961
What we need
to find is the trigger.

313
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,212
Something activates
the latent virus,...

314
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:44,000
...and only Arias knows
what it is.

315
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,735
But until we find that out,...

316
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:50,606
...everyone, living and dead,
are his potential weapons.

317
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,256
If we don't
figure this out now,...

318
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,744
...there won't be
little towns like this...

319
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:56,761
...for you to drink
your sorrows away in...

320
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,081
ever again.

321
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,484
I created a vaccine,...

322
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,186
...and I tried it on myself
and it works.

323
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:08,090
But until we find out
how Arias triggers the virus,...

324
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,760
...who knows if it'll work
the same for everyone else.

325
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,064
My blood holds the answers.

326
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,870
If I die,
get this to a lab you trust.

327
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,210
I can't imagine
what you two have been through.

328
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,614
But I know that neither one
of you are the type of person...

329
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,217
...who would sit here and argue
while the world dies.

330
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,554
That's not who you are.

331
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,658
Or is it?

332
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,846
That wasn't very nice of me.

333
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,766
Leon!

334
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,035
Patricio!

335
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,818
Wait, wait!
Let me explain. Unh!

336
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,039
Leon!
That guy I told you about.

337
00:44:03,074 --> 00:44:06,075
The one that sold out my unit.
You don't understand. Unh!

338
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,345
This is the guy.
Please, stop.

339
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,915
Hey! What do you...?
Official business. It's okay.

340
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,685
Leon, come on!
What do you want?

341
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,055
Please. You're the only one
I know from the DSO.

342
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,625
It's my family.
You've got to save them.

343
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,933
What?

344
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:28,230
My wife and my daughter
are in Spain.

345
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,800
An arms dealer
is getting paid...

346
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,803
...by the surviving members
of Los Iluminados...

347
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,907
...to launch a large-scale
bioterror attack.

348
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:40,710
I know too much. They're going
to kill me and my family.

349
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,963
Did you hear what he said?
It's our lucky day.

350
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,784
"Lucky"?
Are you crazy?

351
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:51,987
He's gonna lead us to our guy.
What are you talking about?

352
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,690
The name Glenn Arias
ring a bell?

353
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:58,027
How do you know?
I'm psychic.

354
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,996
I need your help!
My family!

355
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,032
Let me get this straight.

356
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,700
You try and get me killed,...

357
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:08,003
...and now I'm supposed
to save your family?

358
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,705
Well, how about this?

359
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,422
You tell us
what you know first,

360
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,988
and then
we'll decide if we help.

361
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,285
Son of a bitch!

362
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,088
He was followed!

363
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,761
This is my family.

364
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,096
Please.

365
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:08,698
Save them.

366
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,339
Damn it.

367
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,182
Rebecca!

368
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,789
Target one down.
Target two secured.

369
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:51,207
D.C., they hit us at the hotel
and took Rebecca. Track'em.

370
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,358
I know the big guy.
He's with Arias.

371
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,079
What's Arias want
with Rebecca?

372
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:00,983
I don't know.
I just want to get her back.

373
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:04,486
There goes my vacation.
Again.

374
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,505
<i>Hi, honey, it's me.</i>

375
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,142
<i>Were you able to get the man
you said would help?</i>

376
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:30,279
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

377
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:33,415
<i>Selena misses her daddy.</i>

378
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,985
<i>- Patricio? Hello?
- Can I talk to Papa?</i>

379
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,454
<i>Patricio? Who is this?</i>

380
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:40,589
<i>Can I talk to Papa? Please.</i>

381
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:44,059
<i>Where's Patricio? Put
my husband on the phone right...</i>

382
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,971
There's a reason he gave that
to you before he died.

383
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,460
It might have the answers
we need in it.

384
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,240
We have Rebecca's laptop.

385
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,209
We have leads.

386
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,112
Look, man,

387
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:05,180
I need you.

388
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,143
I succeeded
in reanimating them,

389
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:28,197
but I haven't figured out

390
00:49:28,232 --> 00:49:32,001
how to keep the bodies
from rotting away...yet.

391
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,525
Practice makes perfect.

392
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,940
Meet my guests.

393
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:41,243
My family and some of
my dearest friends.

394
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:48,384
Professor
Rebecca Chambers.

395
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:49,685
Welcome.

396
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,989
I'm Glenn Arias.

397
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:58,227
I heard you found a cure
for my merchandise.

398
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:05,067
For someone so young,
you're quite brilliant.

399
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:10,153
A cure isn't
the only thing I found.

400
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,407
Really?

401
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,411
Please, tell me more.

402
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,516
I figured out how
the latent virus is activated.

403
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:24,153
Animality Virus, Professor.
A-Virus, for short.

404
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:30,325
Your B.O.W.s can tell
who they're supposed to attack.

405
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,462
That's a good selling point
for a weapon.

406
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:35,145
Engineering them
with that trait

407
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,047
must have
been difficult for you.

408
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,368
But I know how you did it.

409
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:43,105
There are three strains
of the virus.

410
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,674
One infects them.

411
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,078
A second acts
as a trigger.

412
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:51,280
The third
gives you the option

413
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:54,049
of choosing
who your target will be.

414
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:57,486
<i>A sort of
inactivation virus.</i>

415
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,221
<i>The vaccine...</i>

416
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:03,781
Bring up the map again.

417
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:09,064
She must have thought
these outbreaks were related.

418
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,448
See how they're all concentrated
around the Great Lakes?

419
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:13,302
If what she said is true,

420
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:16,738
and this thing
can lay dormant inside people,

421
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,273
God knows
how many are infected.

422
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:24,580
<i>You mixed the base virus
in drinking water.</i>

423
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:26,548
I'm impressed.

424
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,384
How did you figure it out?

425
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,301
I noticed
a huge concentration

426
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,370
of outbreaks
around the Great Lakes.

427
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,557
<i>Which
just so happens to be</i>

428
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,793
<i>a major source
of drinking water.</i>

429
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:41,730
But they weren't planned by you.
They happened by accident.

430
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,366
<i>It seems
under certain rare conditions,</i>

431
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:48,770
<i>the latent virus can activate
without the trigger virus.</i>

432
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,406
Speaking of,
the trigger virus

433
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,260
is probably distributed
through the air...

434
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,079
<i>by a gas.</i>

435
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,215
By themselves, these viruses
either have no potency,

436
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,818
or they run the risk
of activating on their own.

437
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,586
But when combined,

438
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:10,292
they become an effective,
controllable bioweapon.

439
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,128
Nicely done, Professor.

440
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:17,166
It's no wonder
you survived Raccoon City.

441
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,585
If the trigger's airborne,
it's harder to control

442
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:24,105
where it goes
or who gets it.

443
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:28,710
So then Arias has to be using
some type of vaccine.

444
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,729
That's how he controls
the spread of an outbreak.

445
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:35,851
He vaccinates anyone
he doesn't want infected first.

446
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,654
Which makes
for a more accurate weapon. See?

447
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,709
You've done your homework
on the A-Virus.

448
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,234
So now what's next?

449
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,705
It wasn't hard for me
to engineer a test cure.

450
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,589
And now
that I know it works,

451
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:01,777
my team
has my research and my blood.

452
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:04,479
Your "merchandise,"
as you put it,

453
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,196
will soon be obsolete
on the marketplace.

454
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,354
I hate to say this,
but your research is incomplete.

455
00:53:14,258 --> 00:53:16,607
If you had found the cure,
you wouldn't have been attacked

456
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:18,127
after you took it.

457
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,764
But you were, weren't you?

458
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,568
Not that it matters.

459
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:29,838
No, you and your vaccine
will soon be out of time.

460
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,243
Tomorrow, the world will be
a different place.

461
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:41,283
Arias is planning something big.

462
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:44,386
Patricio knew
way too much about it.

463
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:47,058
And that's why
he was killed.

464
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:56,598
I know what happened.

465
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,834
They came to kill you,

466
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,403
but killed everyone
you loved instead.

467
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,307
It was your wedding day.

468
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:11,916
The day
time stopped for me.

469
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:25,260
That's Sara,

470
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:26,428
my wife.

471
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,870
You look so much like her.

472
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:43,579
It's not a coincidence
that we met.

473
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,849
It's fate.

474
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,386
Wait.

475
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,073
Where are you going
with this?

476
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,905
I'm redoing the wedding.

477
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:16,945
This time with you.

478
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:22,584
I'll rewrite the past.

479
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,994
Rebecca,

480
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,730
meet Sara.

481
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,607
We're going to be so happy.

482
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,768
On second thought...

483
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:20,642
I'm going to replace
your arm with Sara's.

484
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,782
Maybe that will change
your mind about me.

485
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:37,726
He's gonna use
the trigger virus on New York?

486
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,075
That's what
it looks like.

487
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:40,996
He's out of his mind.

488
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,849
"If the outbreak is deemed
uncontrollable,

489
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,036
"tanks labeled
with a green A

490
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,387
"contain the vaccine
and are ready to deploy.

491
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,674
Location classified."

492
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,726
All we have to do
is find that stuff,

493
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,414
and we can
change everyone back.

494
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:02,050
Like flipping
a safety switch.

495
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,954
But if you were Arias,
where would you keep it?

496
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:09,558
Someplace he can get to fast.
Someplace secure.

497
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,495
His hideout in New York.

498
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,833
And I bet we'll find
Rebecca there too.

499
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,889
We need
to expedite the release.

500
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,976
<i>We're set for
morning rush hour.</i>

501
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,193
I have a feeling the BSAA
will be heading our way,

502
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,448
so we need that
countermeasure.

503
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,818
You're planning
another attack.

504
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:39,120
I'm planning our future.

505
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:41,490
Our time starts now.

506
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,726
"Our"? Yes.

507
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:50,098
With the last
of my remaining friends,

508
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,769
we will begin
our new life together.

509
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:07,935
It's time.

510
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:10,853
Dad...

511
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,972
Wish me luck.

512
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:30,358
Oh, my God.

513
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:32,227
Alex! Alex!

514
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,864
I'll call the ambulance.

515
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,901
Not now, goddamn it.

516
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,046
Everybody get a dose
of Rebecca's vaccine?

517
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:47,035
Good.

518
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,071
What's the status
on the reinforcements?

519
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,006
BSAA and N.Y.P.D. SWAT

520
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,790
are on the ground
in the thick of it.

521
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,945
The state police won't get there
for another three hours.

522
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,014
So that means we have
to nab Arias all by ourselves.

523
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,183
Fantastic.

524
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,653
Yo! The signal's
getting worse.

525
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:11,826
They're using tanker
trucks to spray the virus.

526
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:14,763
He's not trying to turn
a couple thousand.

527
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:16,446
He's trying
to turn them all.

528
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:19,300
We need to take out
those tankers.

529
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,369
Professor Chambers'
research says

530
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,004
the virus can't handle heat.

531
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,155
It's got the same flash point
as gasoline.

532
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:29,811
Perfect. Let's light
a match, watch it burn.

533
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,814
I wish we could get
to Rebecca first,

534
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:34,364
but the priority
is those tankers.

535
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:35,965
So we got
three things to do.

536
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:39,120
One, blow up the tankers.
Two, get Rebecca.

537
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:42,724
Three, grab the vaccine
and deploy it on the city.

538
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,227
And grab Arias. Four things.
Whatever you say, boss.

539
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,764
D.C., Nadia,
you guys work from the Osprey.

540
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:52,133
Roger that, C.

541
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:07,182
Gifts from the BSAA.

542
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:10,081
They said that's the best
they can do for us for now.

543
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:18,481
Dibs on the bike.

544
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:28,303
<i>Once the tankers are down,
rendezvous at Arias' place.</i>

545
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:30,253
<i>Depending on the situation,
we might have</i>

546
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,322
<i>to put Rebecca on hold
until we find that vaccine.</i>

547
01:03:32,342 --> 01:03:33,508
Got it.

548
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,576
Well, you ready to rock?

549
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,912
Are you kidding?

550
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,314
Let's do this.

551
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,205
Damian! Shit.

552
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,910
Damn it.

553
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:18,046
Any ideas?

554
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,217
I'll lead the dogs away.

555
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,887
You go blow up
some more tankers. Good?

556
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,022
Yeah.

557
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:30,391
Here, boy. Come on!

558
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:21,335
This version of the trigger
virus is better than the last.

559
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:25,039
Stronger.
Your blood was the key.

560
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,042
Thank you so much.

561
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:33,681
Unfortunately,
increasing the toxicity means

562
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,784
it can't be administered
via gas anymore.

563
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:40,221
So it's back
to the old needle, I'm afraid.

564
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:41,356
My apologies.

565
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:46,661
If our simulations
were correct,

566
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:49,597
it should start working
in half an hour.

567
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:30,038
- Three down.
- Going for the next one.

568
01:09:56,792 --> 01:10:00,828
<i>Nice to see you
again, Mr. Redfield.</i>

569
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,363
Arias.

570
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:05,548
<i>Thanks
to Professor Chambers,</i>

571
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:08,502
<i>we made
the virus much stronger.</i>

572
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:11,706
<i>If you can stick around
for, oh, another 20 minutes,</i>

573
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:14,408
<i>you'll see how strong.</i>

574
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:18,813
<i>I can't wait for you to meet
the new and improved Rebecca.</i>

575
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:20,948
<i>The question is,</i>

576
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:23,551
<i>do you have it in you
to kill her?</i>

577
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:29,672
<i>My army of the dead
will change</i>

578
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,926
the world for the better.

579
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:35,863
It will correct the imbalance
caused by recent wars.

580
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,632
If you stay alive long enough,

581
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:39,967
you can watch with me
as my B.O.W.s

582
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:42,570
bring down
the most powerful nations,

583
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,473
one by one.

584
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,425
You belong
in a nuthouse, asshole.

585
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,971
Unfortunately,
I'm not crazy.

586
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,517
I want revenge.

587
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:12,967
<i>I'm hitting
the reset button on the world.</i>

588
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:16,704
<i>And my merchandise,
my B.O.W.s,</i>

589
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:19,240
<i>are the right tool
for the job.</i>

590
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,797
Leon.
Sorry I'm late.

591
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:52,242
I had
to take the stairs.

592
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:09,844
Maybe this is
what I've always wanted.

593
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,749
A world in flames,

594
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,919
where only the dead remain.

595
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,700
Rebecca's
running out of time.

596
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,130
Then let's split up.

597
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:41,001
Rebecca.

598
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:38,125
You okay?

599
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:40,995
Chris...

600
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,617
No, no, no.
Wait, wait.

601
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:49,937
Where's the vaccine?

602
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,640
Tell me!

603
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:04,018
You just had to try to save her.

604
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:06,821
You're so predictable, Chris.
That's your weakness.

605
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:18,933
Shit.

606
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:07,368
Rebecca.

607
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,776
You have to kill me.

608
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,144
No.

609
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:19,146
We'll find the vaccine.

610
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,448
Just hang on
a little longer.

611
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:51,945
Diego,

612
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,848
the final stage.

613
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:57,284
Unleash it.

614
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,586
Redfield!

615
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,339
Found you.

616
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:05,199
I'm going to spill
your guts all over.

617
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:18,712
Nadia!

618
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:43,070
Diego!

619
01:25:56,218 --> 01:25:57,318
Shit.

620
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:47,401
Catch.

621
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,466
Bye-bye, asshole.

622
01:28:37,579 --> 01:28:38,879
Rebecca?

623
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:20,553
One more thing
left to do.

624
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:23,490
So let's do it.

625
01:30:42,971 --> 01:30:45,839
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

626
01:30:45,874 --> 01:30:48,542
<i>I never thought my life
would turn out this way.</i>

627
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,582
And once again, we find
ourselves back where we started.

628
01:30:57,752 --> 01:30:59,986
What do you mean?

629
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:02,188
We got the bad guys.

630
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:04,691
Hope we made
the world a little safer.

631
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:12,098
Hey, Chris.

632
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:13,733
Yeah?

633
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:16,223
How much longer
can we keep going on like this?

634
01:31:18,172 --> 01:31:19,639
I don't know.

635
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,874
I never make plans
that far ahead.

636
01:37:05,253 --> 01:37:07,187
