00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,324
Issy is just basically a hippie,
you know?

161
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:36,728
Into yoga, soy...
All of that stuff.

162
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,295
- Okay.
- Hey. Hi, I'm Caitlin.

163
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:41,132
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- This is our coach, Caitlin.

164
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:42,466
She was actually
in a great gymnastics team

165
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:45,370
back in... World War II, was it?

166
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:48,506
Uh, it was barely 15 years ago,
you little punk.

167
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:51,242
This is Emma.
She just moved next door.

168
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:52,843
She's actually a cheerleader
from the States.

169
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,812
So I'm, uh,
secretly trying to recruit her

170
00:07:54,814 --> 00:07:55,846
on to joining our team.

171
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:57,382
Wait. What?

172
00:07:57,384 --> 00:07:58,783
Oh, didn't I mention that?

173
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:01,252
Well, we could always use another
member to round out the team.

174
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:03,254
You wanna show us
what you've got?

175
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:04,756
Um...

176
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:06,190
I mean, I wasn't really planning

177
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:07,992
on jumping in to a team so soon.

178
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,394
Why not?

179
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:11,829
You'll make friends,
you exercise and...

180
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:13,131
I don't know,
you can close your eyes

181
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,165
and pretend you're cheerleading.

182
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,834
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

183
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:17,401
[Emma] <i>Should I tell her?</i>

184
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:19,269
<i>Should I say that I don't wanna
make a bunch of friends</i>

185
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:20,905
<i>that I'll have to leave
in a year?</i>

186
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:23,307
<i>But she'll understand, right?</i>

187
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:25,410
Hannah, give the poor girl
some space.

188
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:27,745
She's probably jet-lagged,
and you guilting her

189
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:29,346
into joining the team
probably isn't helping.

190
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:33,183
Geez, you don't have to get
all Mama Bear on us all. Ugh.

191
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:34,451
[Caitlin] Well, why don't you
just stick around?

192
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:36,287
Watch the girls in action.
No pressure.

193
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,522
- Yeah.
- Come on.

194
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:39,124
At least join us
for some stretches.

195
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,359
At the very least,
it's gonna be a good workout.

196
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:43,927
Okay, I mean,
I, I could use a workout.

197
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,929
Excellent.
Well, you guys get stretching.

198
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:47,999
I'm going to finish off
with the junior squad.

199
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:50,335
I'm looking forward to seeing
what you can do.

200
00:08:50,337 --> 00:08:51,970
Don't worry. You'll be great.

201
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:54,172
So, uh, when does
the rest of your team get here?

202
00:08:54,174 --> 00:08:56,039
Uh...

203
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,475
- This is the rest of the team.
- [Issy] Yeah.

204
00:08:57,477 --> 00:09:01,111
Uh, let's just say
we are in a rebuilding phase.

205
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:05,015
- A rebuilding phase?
- [Hannah] Yeah.

206
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:07,152
Uh, a bunch of girls retired
when they went to uni

207
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:11,822
and we lost a whole bunch
to another team, so...

208
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:14,328
It happened all at once
and this is us.

209
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:17,327
Yeah. [chuckles]

210
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:18,495
Come on.

211

[music continues]

213
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:06,977
Nice, Issy, if you hit
your routine just like that

214
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:09,147
at the state comp this weekend,
you'll be assured a medal.

215
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:11,249
- [Caitlin] Well done.
- Thank you.

216
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:13,418
[upbeat music playing]

217
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,421
- Oops, sorry, guys, wrong music.
- No way.

218
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:18,155
That's actually the music
that my cheer squad

219
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:19,557
won championships with.

220
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,359
What? Show us your moves.

221
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:22,860
Do you guys wanna see
my routine?

222
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,262
- [all] Yeah.
- Let's see what you've got.

223
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:25,429
Okay. Um, Issy.

224
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:26,597
Will you start the music
over again?

225
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,131
- Sure thing.
- Look. You know...

226
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:29,466
It'll look a little weird
without the rest

227

of the group,
but you'll get the idea.

Issy, can you stop the music?

230
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,692
- [music stops]
- You're amazing, Em.

231
00:10:54,694 --> 00:10:56,927
We seriously can see
why you're a champ.

232
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:58,996
Well, thanks.

233
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:00,431
How about you guys
come up here and join me?

234
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,332
I'll teach this whole thing
to you. It'll be fun.

235
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:04,335
Issy, why don't you get
right here in the center?

236
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:08,907
Back there. And then, Hannah
and Mia on either side of her.

237
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:11,042
Cool. Face this way
towards the mirror.

238
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:12,710
Yeah. A little more room.

239
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:14,979
And then
we actually need one more.

240
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:17,181
So, Caitlin, do you wanna
come in behind Issy?

241
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:19,116
Me? Uh, no, no, no.

242

Oh, come on, you dinosaur.

just a bag of fossils.

Ugh. Okay.

245

Okay. Issy, you're gonna do
a walkover right in the center.

246
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:30,294
You two are gonna do
backhand springs.

247
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:32,330
And make sure you leave yourself
enough room.

- Straight to eight, that's it.
- All right.

260
00:11:58,157 --> 00:11:59,957
So you're gonna bend your legs
like this.

Just like that. Do like that.

to comps, you're gonna smash it.

00:14:34,646 --> 00:14:36,449
But this isn't fair.

318
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,317
One more word from your gymnast

319
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:40,750
and you and your team
are red carded.

320
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:42,055
[Caitlin] Okay.

321
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:46,224
Here's what I think
of your yellow card.

322
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,457
[all gasping]

323
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:48,494
[scoffs]

324
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:53,630
- Do you know those two?
- Well, yeah.

325
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:56,200
Right. You and your team
are disqualified.

326
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:59,302
What? No, they-they're
not even a part of our team.

327
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:00,904
- [Hannah] This can't be serious.
- I know, I know.

328
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:02,740
- This isn't fair.
- Just leave it, leave it.

329
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:04,078
[Caitlin] I know.

330
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:09,547
We're disqualified?

331
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,249
Yeah. It was Charlotte and Abi.

332
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:12,549
I got yellow carded for descent

333
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:14,184
and then Charlotte water-bombed
the judge

334
00:15:14,186 --> 00:15:15,887
and now we're disqualified.

335
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,155
Why is Charlotte even here?

336
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:19,789
She isn't even
competing anymore.

337
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,458
You guys know
what Charlotte's like, okay?

338
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,661
She probably did it to see us
fall flat on our face.

339
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:25,562
[Caitlin] Unfortunately,
a red card means

340
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:27,697
the team misses
the next competition, too.

341
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:30,668
But that means
no more comps this year.

342
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,371
Yeah. And no chance
to qualify for nationals.

343
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:35,940
[Caitlin] Look,
I'm really sorry, okay?

344
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:38,442
I know this isn't fair.

345
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:40,680
[sighs] Come on.
Let's get our stuff.

346
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:45,615
[Hannah] It's just not fair.

347
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:46,752
[Emma] Hey.

348
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:50,520
- Who were those girls?
- Charlotte and Abi.

349
00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:52,590
They used to be in our club.

350
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:55,659
They're really good, Em.
Like, really good.

351
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:58,562
- And then they left.
- Why?

352
00:15:58,564 --> 00:15:59,964
Years ago
when we went to nationals,

353
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:02,200
we were certain
we were gonna medal.

354
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:03,734
Then we came seventh, right?

355
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:05,302
Charlotte and Abi decided
they didn't wanna be

356
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:08,371
in a team that couldn't be
champions, so they left,

357
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:10,707
took a bunch of girls with them
and started a cheer team.

358
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,576
Wait. A-a cheer team?

359
00:16:12,578 --> 00:16:14,312
I thought you guys didn't
really have that here.

360
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:15,580
They're horrible people, Em.

361
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:18,282
Like, I am talking, the worst.

362
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:19,549
You can't be thinking
of cheering with them.

363
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:22,320
No. No, no, of course not.

364
00:16:22,322 --> 00:16:24,621
I have dealt with girls
like that plenty of times.

365
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:27,557
They're the last people
you'd wanna be friends with.

366
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,326
I'm really sorry, Hannah.

367
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:31,428
It's, it's okay.
I mean, it's...

368
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,264
You know what?
It's just disappointing.

369
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:36,234
I really thought we'd make it
to nationals this year.

370
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:38,739
Hey. Come on. We got your bag.

371
00:16:42,574 --> 00:16:45,578
[instrumental music]

372
00:16:57,857 --> 00:17:00,457
Sorry to intrude.
Still recovering from the loss?

373
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:02,793
Yeah, it's been a rough morning.

374
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:05,028
Caitlin tried to get
the disqualification appealed,

375
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,464
but it got rejected.

376
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:08,999
I'll bet you, it was Charlotte's
plan that whole time

377
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:11,001
to get us disqualified.

378
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:12,502
You know, next time I see her,

379
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:13,770
I'm gonna get
one of my redback spiders

380
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:14,971
and I'm gonna put it
down her back.

381
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:16,641
I'm not even joking.

382
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:18,942
I can't believe
we're done for the season.

383
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:20,711
I wish we could still compete.

384
00:17:20,713 --> 00:17:23,647
Ugh! I just wanna
crush Charlotte into the ground.

385
00:17:23,649 --> 00:17:26,517
- Please.
- Like, is that too much to ask?

386
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,353
[Emma] <i>And that's when
the idea hit me.</i>

387
00:17:29,355 --> 00:17:31,689
<i>It was perfect.
Everyone would win.</i>

388
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:33,958
<i>The only problem was,
I knew it would mean</i>

389
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,294
<i>we'd all become a lot closer.</i>

390
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:39,563
<i>And that would only make it
that much harder to leave.</i>

391
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:41,865
What if I told you guys

392
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:43,601
that you could still compete

393
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:46,369
and get revenge
on Charlotte and Abi?

394
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:49,707
How? Y...
We're disqualified.

395
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:51,575
Well, for gymnastics.

396
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:55,346
But what if we form
our own cheer squad?

397
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:56,713
I mean, if they're cheerleading,

398
00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:58,749
then there must be competitions,
right?

399
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:00,951
Well, cheer's just
starting to catch on here,

400
00:18:00,953 --> 00:18:02,420
so there's a few, but...

401
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:05,556
Okay. Then why can't we
get a team together?

402
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:07,624
[Caitlin] So a cheer team, huh?

403
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:10,126
[Emma] Yeah. It's a great way
to keep competing.

404
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:12,096
Just think of it
exactly like gymnastics,

405
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:14,365
but with music
and dancing added.

406
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:15,665
And if we're really good,
it'll be

407
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,434
a new championship
to compete for.

408
00:18:17,436 --> 00:18:19,569
Well, if you're willing
to put in the work, I'm in.

409
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:22,073
I still think my redback spider
was a solid idea, but...

410
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:23,441
[laughing]

411
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:24,909
Okay, okay, first things first.

412
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:26,977
We do have enough girls here
to form a cheer team,

413
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:29,145
but if we're trying to compete
against Charlotte at her level,

414
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:30,347
we'll need more members.

415
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:32,016
So anybody know

416
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:33,718
how big her team is?

417
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,752
Well, last time we saw them
cheering at the footy,

418
00:18:35,754 --> 00:18:38,455
there was only like, what,
ten or twelve maybe?

419
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:39,890
- Yeah.
- Wow. Yeah, that's small.

420
00:18:39,892 --> 00:18:42,660
Any team I've ever been
a part of has been full 24.

421
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:44,428
Like we said, it's too new,

422
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,064
so all the teams
are still pretty small.

423
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,365
Do you know what level they are?

424
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,101
Um, just became level four.

425
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:51,801
That's the highest
there is here.

426
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:53,002
- How the hell do you know that?
- What?

427
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:55,005
[Emma] We-we can totally
achieve that.

428
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:59,743
Oh, wait, uh, also,
we're gonna need uniforms, too.

429
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:01,778
- It's gonna be a lot of work.
- Well, I'm in.

430
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,847
And I think
I can arrange uniforms.

431
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,449
How about you guys?

432
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:08,486
- I think it sounds good.
- Okay. All right, everybody in.

433
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:11,422
Can't let you hog all the glory
without me.

434
00:19:11,424 --> 00:19:14,090
Okay. On three,
everybody say rah!

435
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:15,893
Wait. Rah?
What is that supposed to mean?

436
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:17,494
It's a cheerleading thing.

437
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:18,628
Well, wouldn't something like
cheers be more...

438
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,930
- [Hannah] Just do it, Mia.
- No.

439
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:21,899
- Okay. Fine.
- Ready?

440
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:23,933
One, two, three.

441
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:25,071
- [all] <i>Rah!</i>
- [Mia] <i>Cheers!</i>

442
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:30,007
So do you know
what Charlotte's team is like?

443
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:32,009
I've seem 'em a couple of times.

444
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:34,077
Not competing,
just at the footy.

445
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,913
All right, they are really good,
you know?

446
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:40,217
Already won a bunch of trophies,
they've been to nationals.

447
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:42,588
This might not be
as easy as I thought.

448
00:19:45,124 --> 00:19:47,490
Hey.

449
00:19:47,492 --> 00:19:50,493
Do you really think
we can beat them?

450
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:52,195
Do they have guys on their team?

451
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:55,665
Uh, I've never seen any.

452
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:58,969
If we have guys,
it would be a huge advantage.

453
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:01,070
We could really
throw some big stunts.

454
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:03,874
Anything to smash
Charlotte and Abi.

455
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:06,644
You know, if you wanna
scope out the competition,

456
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:08,979
Charlotte's gonna be cheering
at the footy game tomorrow.

457
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:12,215
- Oh, football. I love football.
- Uh, Aussie rules?

458
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:14,718
Oh, is that like rugby?

459
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,221
Not quite. It's also not
cricket, soccer or field hockey.

460
00:20:18,223 --> 00:20:21,090
Well, just come with me, okay?
You're gonna love it.

461
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:23,493
[chuckles] Okay.

to give up gymnastics

00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:46,496
You guys good?

631
00:28:46,498 --> 00:28:49,031
- Of course, we're good.
- Yeah, we're really good.

632
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:53,502
Well, congratulations
'cause now you'll be great.

633
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:55,705
- I'm in.
- All right.

634
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:58,008
The training's Monday
and Wednesdays at the gym.

635
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,412
I'll be there.

636
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:07,017
Okay.

637
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:08,986
What's with the whole
Charlotte and Abi thing?

638
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:10,186
[stammers] What was up
with all that?

639
00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:12,055
I'll let Tilds
explain it to you.

640
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:13,289
We have another member
to recruit

641
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,458
before we can call it a day.

642
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,491
Care to tell me what

643
00:29:15,493 --> 00:29:16,692
the plan is this time?

644
00:29:16,694 --> 00:29:18,494
What's the fun in that?

645
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:20,230
Let's just say,
we're gonna make her an offer

646
00:29:20,232 --> 00:29:21,798
she can't refuse.

647
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,066
Oh, wow, you're not in, like,

648
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:26,369
the Australian mafia, are you?

649
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:28,206
Why do you have to be
so cryptic?

650
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:32,174
Seriously?

651
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:35,278
- Belly dancing?
- Oh, very serious.

652
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,813
Watch and learn.

653
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:38,647
Okay.

654
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:40,784
And what about this offer
she can't refuse?

655
00:29:40,786 --> 00:29:42,618
Sorry, no spoilers.

656
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,059
But when I point to you,
just say, Liam.

657
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,227
What? Liam? Wait. Hannah.

658
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:53,232
[Middle-Eastern music playing]

659
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,241
Hannah, what are you doing here?

660
00:30:03,575 --> 00:30:06,209
Actually, came to see you.
This is Emma.

661
00:30:06,211 --> 00:30:08,345
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

662
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:10,047
Em's convinced us
to start a cheer team.

663
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:12,149
And we just thought
you'd be perfect for it.

664
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:13,349
Oh, that's awesome.

665
00:30:13,351 --> 00:30:15,419
I'm sorry, look,
I'm really flattered,

666
00:30:15,421 --> 00:30:17,788
but I'm taking
12 hours of dance a week.

667
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,123
I don't have the bandwidth
to add anything else.

668
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:23,559
Such a pity. We're trying to get
the old gang back together.

669
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:26,232
You know, Mia, Issy, Tilds.

670
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:28,765
Uh, Liam.

671
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:31,300
Liam? How is he?

672
00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:33,502
Wait, has he said anything
about me?

673
00:30:33,504 --> 00:30:36,573
I mean, wait, sorry.
Forget I asked, um...

674
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:38,374
He's gonna cheer with you guys?

675
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:41,644
We hope so.
He seemed interested.

676
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:43,113
Why? Are you guys friends?

677
00:30:43,115 --> 00:30:46,182
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

678
00:30:46,184 --> 00:30:48,484
Em, you didn't know.
They used to date.

679
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:50,586
- They made a great couple, too.
- Oh.

680
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:52,655
Ah, I feel so stupid.

681
00:30:52,657 --> 00:30:55,092
I mean, I didn't even think
how you would feel,

682
00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:56,692
you know,
spending so much time with him.

683

of feelings resurfacing,

685
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:04,634
- Oh.
- No, that would be unfortunate.

686
00:31:04,636 --> 00:31:07,639
[music continues]

687
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:13,509
[Emma] You told them
when to come to practice, right?

688
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:15,714
[Hannah] Yeah,
they should be here any minute.

689
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:18,115
Hopefully.

690
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:20,383
- [door creaking]
- Wait.

691
00:31:20,385 --> 00:31:22,652
[Mia] You invited her to join?

692
00:31:22,654 --> 00:31:24,421
- [Emma] Is there a problem?
- Are you kidding me?

693
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:26,455
Tilds is the worst.

694
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:29,226
Tilds and Mia
had, like, this falling out,

695
00:31:29,228 --> 00:31:30,559
back when
they were on the same team.

696
00:31:30,561 --> 00:31:32,130
[Emma] Hm.

697
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:35,132
Hey, pip squeak.

698
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:36,199
I didn't know
this team are letting

699
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:37,767
little kiddies compete.

700
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:39,137
Ow!

701
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:41,872
Hey, coach. Warm-up?

702
00:31:41,874 --> 00:31:43,606
[Caitlin] Yeah,
you know the drill.

703
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:45,610
[instrumental music]

704
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,345
- Go the other way.
- No.

705
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:49,882
- Yes, cooperate.
- No.

706
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:54,483
Oh, am I early?
Is everyone here?

707
00:31:54,485 --> 00:31:57,522
We got some stragglers.
You know boys.

708
00:31:59,191 --> 00:32:00,193
At least I hope so.

709
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,660
[door opens, shuts]

710
00:32:03,662 --> 00:32:05,595
[Caitlin] Hey, Liam,
nice to see you.

711
00:32:05,597 --> 00:32:08,230
You can drop your stuff.
Join in the warm-up.

712
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:10,403
- I told you.
- Hm.

713
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:19,611
[Liam] Amahli.

714
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,778
Hey, Liam.

715
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,580
I heard you might join the team.

716
00:32:24,582 --> 00:32:27,317
Really? And you still came?

717
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,652
Yeah.

718
00:32:28,654 --> 00:32:29,952
Well, I'm glad you're here.

719
00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:31,887
[stammers] For the team.

720
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:33,856
- Not because I'm...
- [Emma] Okay!

721
00:32:33,858 --> 00:32:37,460
I think we're warm. Um,
do you guys wanna get started?

722
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:39,429
[sighs] Okay, sounds good.

723
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:41,631
All right, guys, I'm
super excited to have you here.

724
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:44,201
This cheerleading thing
is a little bit new to me,

725
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:46,435
so I'm gonna coach you
through your gymnastics moves,

726
00:32:46,437 --> 00:32:49,205
but Emma will lead the routines.
All right?

727
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:51,343
- Emma, you're up.
- All right.

728
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:57,513
[Emma] <i>So maybe our team was
a little rough around the edges</i>

729
00:32:57,515 --> 00:32:59,915
<i>and there was some tension
already bubbling,</i>

730
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:02,751
<i>but we had a lot of raw talent
out on the floor.</i>

731
00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:06,222
<i>It just needed to be molded
into one cohesive squad.</i>

732
00:33:06,224 --> 00:33:07,590
[sighs] Okay, guys, look.

733
00:33:07,592 --> 00:33:11,196
I've been a part
of a lot of cheer teams.

734
00:33:11,963 --> 00:33:13,462
But I feel like

735
00:33:13,464 --> 00:33:16,266
this one has the potential
to be the best.

736
00:33:16,268 --> 00:33:18,234
I feel like
we could go to nationals.

737
00:33:18,236 --> 00:33:20,336
So why don't we start
by getting in formation?

738
00:33:20,338 --> 00:33:21,671
Follow me.

739
00:33:21,673 --> 00:33:23,006
- Okay, you guys ready?
- Yeah.

740
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:24,574
We're gonna start with this,

741
00:33:24,576 --> 00:33:25,874
and you step forward.

742
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:28,010
Go out, two.

743
00:33:28,012 --> 00:33:30,946
In three. Four.

744
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:33,952
[instrumental music]

745
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,022
Five, six, seven, eight.

746
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:42,625
[laughing] Oh, my God!

747
00:33:42,627 --> 00:33:44,429
[Caitlin] Great work.

748
00:33:47,065 --> 00:33:50,066
Okay, so we still
don't have enough members

749
00:33:50,068 --> 00:33:52,335
to properly compete,
so if you know anyone,

750
00:33:52,337 --> 00:33:53,905
it'd be a huge help.

751
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,509
Anyone? Really?

752
00:33:58,777 --> 00:34:01,678
You know, we could really use
another guy

753
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,448
to help with formations
and stunt groups.

754
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,416
Well, Liam,
you got any jock friends

755
00:34:07,418 --> 00:34:10,289
willing to spend weeknights
with a bunch of girls?

756
00:34:13,492 --> 00:34:15,524
I actually might.

757
00:34:15,526 --> 00:34:17,593
Meet me at the Blue Eagles
soccer pitch grandstand at 3:00

758
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:19,529
on Saturday.

759
00:34:19,531 --> 00:34:22,598
I reckon I know just the guy.

760
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,604
[instrumental music]

761
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:31,875
So what are we doing here?

762
00:34:31,877 --> 00:34:33,479
Just wait and see.

763
00:34:36,615 --> 00:34:39,582
It was nice seeing Amahli
at the practice yesterday.

764
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:41,950
Though it was a little awkward.

765
00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:44,421
That's what happens
when you jilt someone, big guy.

- [whistle blows]
- [scoffs]

767
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:48,558
[Emma] I don't know, it seemed
like you guys were getting along.

768
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,328
Maybe she was just nervous
about joining a new team.

769
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,662
Yeah, maybe.

770
00:34:52,664 --> 00:34:54,430
- [whistle blows]
- [crowd applauding]

771
00:34:54,432 --> 00:34:56,031
But she looked amazing.

772
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:57,801
Just don't stuff it up
this time, yeah?

773
00:34:57,803 --> 00:34:59,868
Yeah, I won't.

774
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,604
Amahli's pretty special,

775
00:35:01,606 --> 00:35:04,341
but I don't think
she's ever gonna forgive me

776
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:05,711
for bailing on her.

777
00:35:08,412 --> 00:35:10,346
Well, when they were dating,

778
00:35:10,348 --> 00:35:12,615
Liam was meant to be
in a salsa demo with Amahli

779
00:35:12,617 --> 00:35:14,017
at the school formal.

780
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:16,151
And it was, like,
a really big deal for her.

781
00:35:16,153 --> 00:35:19,421
- And he didn't show.
- What happened?

782
00:35:19,423 --> 00:35:21,924
Amahli had to drop out.
She didn't have a partner.

783
00:35:21,926 --> 00:35:23,625
- [crowd cheering]
- [scoffs]

784
00:35:23,627 --> 00:35:25,428
She must have felt horrible.

785
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,596
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

786
00:35:27,598 --> 00:35:29,832
I just got so self-conscious.

787
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:32,368
And, well,
I was never that good at it.

788
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,437
The guys were giving me
such a hard time,

789
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:38,375
so I just, I just panicked.

790
00:35:38,377 --> 00:35:39,879
I didn't even call her.

791
00:35:41,412 --> 00:35:42,447
Hm.

792
00:35:44,149 --> 00:35:47,953
Well, maybe it's not too late.

793
00:35:49,687 --> 00:35:50,854
It just so happens,

794
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:53,957
I won junior championship
in salsa

795
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:56,125
when I was younger.

796
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:57,861
Maybe I could teach you
a few things.

797
00:35:57,863 --> 00:36:00,029
You could surprise Amahli.

798
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:02,165
- Really?
- Yeah.

799
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:05,801
That's what friends are for.
[laughs]

800
00:36:05,803 --> 00:36:08,203
[Emma] <i>There was that word
again. Friends.</i>

801
00:36:08,205 --> 00:36:10,439
<i>I guess there's no denying it.</i>

802
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:12,508
<i>I'm getting in deeper now.</i>

803
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,611
Well, here comes our guy now.

804
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:17,616
- [crowd cheering]
- [upbeat music]

805
00:36:23,053 --> 00:36:26,057
[crowd cheering, applauding]

806
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:30,225
Wow! He's good.

807
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:32,962
But I mean, how does
this translate to cheer?

808
00:36:32,964 --> 00:36:34,166
Just watch.

809
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:38,167
[Hannah] I did not know
Ethan could do that.

810
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:39,504
See that?

811
00:36:41,673 --> 00:36:43,439
[crowd cheering]

812
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:44,577
[whistle blows]

813
00:36:47,044 --> 00:36:48,444
So I used to compete against him

814
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:49,979
in gymnastics
when we were younger.

815
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:51,513
Okay.

816
00:36:51,515 --> 00:36:52,881
But something tells me

817
00:36:52,883 --> 00:36:55,451
he'll be quite eager
to start it up again.

818
00:36:55,453 --> 00:36:57,823
- Mm.
- Mm.

819
00:36:59,156 --> 00:37:00,957
- Oh, hi. Emma, right?
- Yeah.

820
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:02,725
It's-it's really great
to see you.

821
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:06,662
- Thanks for comin' out to watch.
- It was my pleasure.

822
00:37:06,664 --> 00:37:08,798
Uh, I mean, it was, uh,
it was, it was our pleasure.

823
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,767
It wasn't just mine.

824
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:15,040
Yeah, we'd love to come
and cheer on the team, don't we?

825
00:37:16,975 --> 00:37:20,542
Wasn't there something
you wanted to ask Ethan?

826
00:37:20,544 --> 00:37:22,111
Yes. Right.

827
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:24,214
Yeah, I was just,
I was wondering if, uh,

828
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:26,582
you know, you're not too busy
or anything,

829
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:28,618
if, uh, you know,

830
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,690
you had any interest at all...

831
00:37:33,057 --> 00:37:35,058
Will you join
our cheerleading squad?

832
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,060
[clears throat]

833
00:37:37,062 --> 00:37:39,595
Uh, that's what
you wanted to ask me...

834
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:43,899
[clears throat] Uh, yeah,
I mean, cheerleading.

835
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:46,703
- Um, do guys even do that?
- Liam does.

836
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:47,840
[clears throat]

837
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,011
- Are you on the team?
- Emma's pretty much the captain.

838
00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:56,546
Yeah, maybe I'll come
check it out.

839
00:37:56,548 --> 00:37:58,247
I'll text you Emma's number

840
00:37:58,249 --> 00:38:00,683
and she can send you
the details.

841
00:38:00,685 --> 00:38:02,852
Uh, no, it's, it's fine.
It's really not necessary.

842
00:38:02,854 --> 00:38:05,154
- Already done.
- Uh, great.

843
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:07,193
Text Emma
if you wanna join, okay?

844
00:38:08,693 --> 00:38:10,660
Sounds good.

845
00:38:10,662 --> 00:38:12,060
Take care, Emma.

846
00:38:12,062 --> 00:38:13,665
Bye. [chuckles]

847
00:38:14,665 --> 00:38:17,299
- Oh!
- [chuckling]

848
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:19,334
Oh, my God.

849
00:38:19,336 --> 00:38:21,537
Hey, Liam, can you just close
Emma's mouth?

850
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:22,738
- She's drooling a little.
- Okay.

851
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,140
All right, all right,
all right, yes.

852
00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:26,743
Stop. I think he's cute.
Okay, we get it.

853
00:38:26,745 --> 00:38:28,310
Can we please not be children
about this?

854
00:38:28,312 --> 00:38:30,178
- Thank you.
- Well, mwah, mwah.

855
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,650
[indistinct chatter]

856
00:38:36,955 --> 00:38:37,953
Hm.

857
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:39,354
- Hey there, kid.
- Hey.

858
00:38:39,356 --> 00:38:40,924
Have a good day?

859
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:43,125
Yeah. I guess
you could say that.

860
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:44,894
Good, good
'cause I got some great news.

861
00:38:44,896 --> 00:38:47,830
I've just been waitin'
for the right time to tell ya.

862
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:50,767
[Emma] <i>Oh, no.
He's said that before.</i>

863
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:52,368
<i>And it almost always means...</i>

864
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,169
I think
we're gettin' out of here early.

865
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:56,872
<i>Yup. Called it.</i>

866
00:38:56,874 --> 00:38:59,042
My superior officer
in California is transferring

867
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:01,280
and, um,
they offered me the job.

868
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,580
If I take the promotion,

869
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:06,952
well, we might be able
to stay in California for good.

870
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,756
Em?

871
00:39:12,856 --> 00:39:16,292
Do you know
how long it would be?

872
00:39:16,294 --> 00:39:19,328
I-I mean, just because,
you know, my friends and I,

873
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,397
the-the squad,

874
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:23,765
we're trying to compete
at the state championships.

875
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:26,336
It-it won't be for a few months,
so you still get to compete,

876
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:28,404
but the thing is
we won't be here

877
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:30,906
for the 12 months
that we thought.

878
00:39:30,908 --> 00:39:33,343
You get to go back
to your friends.

879
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:35,278
Isn't that great?

880
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,615
[Emma] <i>No, as always,
it's the worst timing.</i>

881
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:41,750
<i>I'm not ready
to say goodbye again.</i>

882
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:44,886
It'll be like we never left.

883
00:39:44,888 --> 00:39:46,258
Just you and me, right?

884
00:39:49,426 --> 00:39:51,026
Right.

885
00:39:51,028 --> 00:39:53,798

[instrumental music]

887
00:40:01,906 --> 00:40:04,374
About time, captain.
Some of us have stuff to do.

888
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:06,709
I'm sorry, guys.
Is this everybody?

889
00:40:06,711 --> 00:40:08,781
Oh, we're just waiting on Ethan.

890
00:40:12,716 --> 00:40:13,982
Do you think he'll come?

891
00:40:13,984 --> 00:40:16,451
Don't worry,
you smitten little kitten.

892
00:40:16,453 --> 00:40:17,622
He'll be here.

893
00:40:19,057 --> 00:40:21,225
- Okay.
- [door opens, shuts]

894
00:40:24,028 --> 00:40:25,164
Hey.

895
00:40:26,296 --> 00:40:28,131
[chuckles]

896
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:29,301
Told you.

897
00:40:31,903 --> 00:40:34,770
[Emma] <i>Okay.
Get it together, Em.</i>

898
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:37,140
<i>If we're gonna win,
they need a leader.</i>

899
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:38,408
<i>Just don't think about leaving</i>

900
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:41,743
<i>and everything will be fine.</i>

901
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:45,048
All right,
let's get down to business.

902
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:48,053
[upbeat music playing]

903
00:40:58,396 --> 00:40:59,631
Up!

904
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:05,767
Have you told anyone else
you're doing this?

905
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:08,437
No way. And what about you?

906
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:12,375
Same as you. Less people that
know about this, the better.

907
00:41:12,377 --> 00:41:14,413
Well, Em is pretty awesome.

908
00:41:15,513 --> 00:41:17,245
Yeah.

909
00:41:17,247 --> 00:41:19,818
You-you know, I think she's
keen on me, actually, yeah.

910
00:41:24,823 --> 00:41:26,022
- Just like that.
- Yeah.

911
00:41:26,024 --> 00:41:28,327
Out. Straighten it.

912
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:33,698
[indistinct chatter]

913
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,468
- [chuckling] No, no...
- What? Wait, what?

914
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,171
[Emma] <i>Everything is going
so great,</i>

915
00:41:42,173 --> 00:41:45,006
<i>but we still need
a couple more team members.</i>

916
00:41:45,008 --> 00:41:47,780
- This way.
- Nice.

917

[birds chirping]

918
00:41:51,548 --> 00:41:53,515
- Hi.
- Oh, Ethan, hey.

919
00:41:53,517 --> 00:41:56,051
Uh, if you're lookin' for Liam,
I think he already left.

920
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:58,122
No, I was actually
waiting for you.

921
00:41:59,957 --> 00:42:03,825
No, I was wondering, maybe you
wanted to hang out tomorrow?

922
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:06,028
Like, just the two of us.

923
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,230
Oh, like a...

924
00:42:08,232 --> 00:42:11,399
- Like, a date?
- [chuckles] Whoa.

925
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:13,169
[Emma] <i>You heard what dad said.</i>

926
00:42:13,171 --> 00:42:17,073
<i>We're leaving in a few months.
Don't get too attached.</i>

927
00:42:17,075 --> 00:42:18,274
<i>Let him down gently.</i>

928
00:42:18,276 --> 00:42:19,575
Look, I promise you.

929
00:42:19,577 --> 00:42:21,109
If nothing else,

930
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:24,814
it'll be fun and informational.

931
00:42:24,816 --> 00:42:28,250
[chuckles]
"Fun and informational."

932
00:42:28,252 --> 00:42:31,787
That sounds romantic. [chuckles]

933
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:35,057
- What do you say?
- What did you have in mind?

Oh, this is so cool,
I've never seen

937
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:46,035
an albino kangaroo before.

938
00:42:46,037 --> 00:42:47,138
Yeah.

939
00:42:54,111 --> 00:42:56,178
Just keep him
nice and low for me.

940
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,816
- Okay.
- Stay nice and still.

941
00:43:02,053 --> 00:43:04,086
He's so cute.

942
00:43:04,088 --> 00:43:06,225
I'm so excited right now,
you have no idea.

943
00:43:11,062 --> 00:43:13,365
Oh! I'm sorry about that.

944
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:17,469
Oi.

945
00:43:21,104 --> 00:43:23,242
So it was, like, a legit date?

946
00:43:24,475 --> 00:43:27,142
- I guess.
- It was? [chuckles]

947
00:43:27,144 --> 00:43:28,877
You're gonna break
the poor boy's heart

948
00:43:28,879 --> 00:43:30,446
if you leave in a year.

949
00:43:30,448 --> 00:43:31,917
Yeah. [chuckles]

950
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:35,151
Hey, so, uh, remind me again,

951
00:43:35,153 --> 00:43:36,218
what are we doing here?

952
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,356
Oh, just follow my lead.

953
00:43:40,524 --> 00:43:42,160
Hannah! Ugh!

954
00:43:43,127 --> 00:43:44,429
Every time.

955
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:53,502
Hi, girls. Are you here
to see the mayor?

956
00:43:53,504 --> 00:43:55,136
- Yes. Yeah.
- She'll be right with you.

957
00:43:55,138 --> 00:43:57,540
- Please take a seat.
- Lovely. Thank you.

958
00:43:57,542 --> 00:43:59,040
[telephone ringing]

959
00:43:59,042 --> 00:44:01,076
- [Emma] The mayor?
- [Hannah] Uh-huh.

960
00:44:01,078 --> 00:44:03,245
You still haven't told me
why we're here.

961
00:44:03,247 --> 00:44:06,482
[Mayor] It was a pleasure
speaking with you, girls.

962
00:44:06,484 --> 00:44:10,118
Hello, Hannah. And you must be
Emma, the American.

963
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,654
- Lovely to meet you.
- Hi.

964
00:44:11,656 --> 00:44:14,890
I've had a chance to review
your request for funding.

965
00:44:14,892 --> 00:44:17,560
Charlotte and Abi have also
asked me to fund their team.

966
00:44:17,562 --> 00:44:19,294
I'm afraid we can't fund
two teams

967
00:44:19,296 --> 00:44:20,595
within such close proximity

968
00:44:20,597 --> 00:44:22,665
in our council area.

969
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:24,933
So, uh, w-what does this mean?

970
00:44:24,935 --> 00:44:27,169
I was going to present
the documentation

971
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:29,037
from both squads
and put it to a vote,

972
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:30,605
but Abi's had rather...

973
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:32,274
It was Charlotte.

974
00:44:32,276 --> 00:44:34,042
Oh, was it? Oh.

975
00:44:34,044 --> 00:44:36,912
Charlotte suggested
the council support the team

976
00:44:36,914 --> 00:44:39,482
who wins the state championship.

977
00:44:39,484 --> 00:44:41,250
[stammers]
We're a new team, though.

978
00:44:41,252 --> 00:44:43,618
We're gonna need funding
to even compete.

979
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,288
Well, as Charlotte and Abi
pointed out,

980
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,323
Coreega Gymnastics has received

981
00:44:48,325 --> 00:44:50,158
a great deal of funding
over the years,

982
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,928
and I think you'll agree
it's only reasonable

983
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,397
that the council
should support the team

984
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,964
who will best represent
our area.

985
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:57,933
- But...
- Good, it's settled.

986
00:44:57,935 --> 00:44:59,734
Whoever achieves
the highest result

987
00:44:59,736 --> 00:45:01,537
in the state championships

988
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:03,038
will receive council funding.

989
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,339
Thank you, girls.

990
00:45:04,341 --> 00:45:06,345
I must move
to my next appointment.

991
00:45:08,146 --> 00:45:09,578
You know, Emma,
it's not too late

992
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,247
to join a championship team.

993
00:45:12,249 --> 00:45:14,283
Maybe it's time
you ditched the losers.

994
00:45:14,285 --> 00:45:16,252
We'll see who the losers are.

995
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:19,087
[scoffs] Suit yourselves.

996
00:45:19,089 --> 00:45:21,126
Don't say we didn't offer.

997
00:45:24,495 --> 00:45:26,194
She drives me nuts.

998
00:45:26,196 --> 00:45:27,763
Seriously, I just wish
Mia was here or something

999
00:45:27,765 --> 00:45:30,035
just to throw a spider at her.

1000
00:45:31,602 --> 00:45:32,971
This is good.

1001
00:45:33,671 --> 00:45:36,439
How do you figure that?

1002
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:37,740
Hannah, do you not see
that Charlotte's

1003
00:45:37,742 --> 00:45:40,176
tryin' to stop us
from competing?

1004
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:43,245
If we weren't a threat,
why would they even bother?

1005
00:45:43,247 --> 00:45:44,779
I guess.

1006
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:47,582
But how are we
even gonna compete?

1007
00:45:47,584 --> 00:45:49,551
Right, we don't
even have uniforms.

1008
00:45:49,553 --> 00:45:51,120
We can't even afford to pay

1009
00:45:51,122 --> 00:45:52,654
our entrance fee
for the competition.

1010
00:45:52,656 --> 00:45:55,126
Well, we're not giving up.
Okay?

1011
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,261
I know a guaranteed way
to make some money.

1012
00:45:59,263 --> 00:46:02,263
It has worked with every squad
I have ever been a part of.

1013
00:46:02,265 --> 00:46:05,269
[instrumental music]

1014
00:46:14,144 --> 00:46:16,444
[Hannah]
So this was your big idea?

1015
00:46:16,446 --> 00:46:20,116
I don't get it. A car wash
and barbecue always works.

1016
00:46:20,118 --> 00:46:21,283
Yeah, I'm actually surprised

1017
00:46:21,285 --> 00:46:22,718
our incredible team dynamic

1018
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,352
isn't doing the charm.

1019
00:46:24,354 --> 00:46:26,455
Guys, stop, come on.
Just give it to her.

1020
00:46:26,457 --> 00:46:28,193
You're not children.

1021
00:46:33,397 --> 00:46:36,432
[Tilds] Okay, so we've already
washed my car three times now,

1022
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:39,834
trying to inspire someone
to pull in.

1023
00:46:39,836 --> 00:46:41,136
What's the total?

1024
00:46:41,138 --> 00:46:43,071
Well, factoring the cost

1025
00:46:43,073 --> 00:46:44,774
of the food and supplies,

1026
00:46:44,776 --> 00:46:47,042
we've managed to break even.

1027
00:46:47,044 --> 00:46:48,444
[Hannah] So no uniforms,

1028
00:46:48,446 --> 00:46:51,212
but we can buy a Magaschoni.

1029
00:46:51,214 --> 00:46:53,149
Great.

1030
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:55,283
And where have they been?

1031
00:46:55,285 --> 00:46:58,087
I don't know.
Footy or training or something.

1032
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:00,423
How's it goin'?
You makin' heaps?

1033
00:47:00,425 --> 00:47:02,691
No, not good, we even put Issy
out in the front

1034
00:47:02,693 --> 00:47:04,692
in one of her poses
to attract people and...

1035
00:47:04,694 --> 00:47:06,798
- [car honks]
- That's not working, either.

1036
00:47:08,832 --> 00:47:10,466
We gotta do something.

1037
00:47:10,468 --> 00:47:12,571
Yeah. Yeah, this is pretty sad.

1038
00:47:14,338 --> 00:47:16,705
I've got an idea.

1039
00:47:16,707 --> 00:47:18,506
Let's go.

1040
00:47:18,508 --> 00:47:20,508
- [Liam] I got an idea, too.
- Where are you going?

1041
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:22,444
- Oi, come back.
- Wait, hey!

1042
00:47:22,446 --> 00:47:24,580
Hey, where you go...
We might need that bucket.

1043
00:47:24,582 --> 00:47:26,549
When all of our customers
pour in.

1044
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:29,554
[instrumental music]

1045
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,099
Insurance and incentive.

1046
00:47:43,734 --> 00:47:45,600
[Ethan] Your turn
at the footy club.

1047
00:47:45,602 --> 00:47:47,703
- Hey, guys. How you going?
- [man] Hi, guys.

1048
00:47:47,705 --> 00:47:49,370
[man] Heard you needed
some help.

1049
00:47:49,372 --> 00:47:51,573
Brought the boys along
to assist.

1050
00:47:51,575 --> 00:47:52,774
- All right.
- [man] All right.

1051
00:47:52,776 --> 00:47:54,245
[chuckling]

1052
00:47:55,912 --> 00:47:57,648
- How you doin'?
- Real good. Thanks.

1053
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,151
Can we help?

1054
00:48:02,153 --> 00:48:04,386
Uh, with our fundraiser? Sure.

1055
00:48:04,388 --> 00:48:07,189
I'm Bec, that's Millie,
Rachel and Will.

1056
00:48:07,191 --> 00:48:09,225
- Emma.
- [Bec] Yeah, we know.

1057
00:48:09,227 --> 00:48:11,326
We heard about your cheer team.

1058
00:48:11,328 --> 00:48:13,662
We also heard
you're looking for new members.

1059
00:48:13,664 --> 00:48:15,163
- Do you guys cheer?
- Yeah.

1060
00:48:15,165 --> 00:48:17,265
We're a stunt team
from the Eastern Hills.

1061
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:19,167
No way! That's perfect.

1062
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:21,837
Wait, but why would you
wanna cheer with us?

1063
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,372
Well, honestly,
Charlotte and Abi

1064
00:48:24,374 --> 00:48:27,308
have been terrorizing every
other cheer team in the area.

1065
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,343
Ours included.

1066
00:48:28,345 --> 00:48:29,345
When we heard that someone

1067
00:48:29,347 --> 00:48:30,745
was finally forming a team

1068
00:48:30,747 --> 00:48:31,913
good enough to take them on,

1069
00:48:31,915 --> 00:48:34,649
we wanted to see for ourselves.

1070
00:48:34,651 --> 00:48:36,384
Yeah, but are you any good?

1071
00:48:36,386 --> 00:48:39,390
[instrumental music]

1072
00:48:51,301 --> 00:48:53,104
[chuckling] Wow.

1073
00:49:00,377 --> 00:49:02,113
You're decent, I guess.

1074
00:49:05,283 --> 00:49:06,585
You're in!

1075
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:15,991
All right, guys,
so I've counted the money.

1076
00:49:15,993 --> 00:49:17,859
We have way above what we need.

1077
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:20,428
Uniforms, entry fee,
everything is covered!

1078
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:22,501
[all cheering]

1079
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,334
Yeah, you're welcome.

1080
00:49:25,336 --> 00:49:27,836
Good thing Ethan and I
came along to save the day.

1081
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:30,475
- [Hannah chuckles]
- You were barely even there.

1082
00:49:31,508 --> 00:49:32,741
Hey! No, no.

1083
00:49:32,743 --> 00:49:34,276
Oh, no, stop, stop, stop!

1084
00:49:34,278 --> 00:49:37,281
[all screaming]

1085
00:49:39,584 --> 00:49:40,785
Wet 'em.

1086
00:49:42,385 --> 00:49:44,755
[screaming]

1087
00:49:46,524 --> 00:49:50,392
[Emma] <i>Like I said,
a car wash always works.</i>

1088
00:49:50,394 --> 00:49:51,961
<i>Not only did we have
the money we needed,</i>

1089
00:49:51,963 --> 00:49:54,964
<i>but we also picked up the extra
team members we needed.</i>

1090
00:49:54,966 --> 00:49:57,732
<i>We were also
finally acting like a team.</i>

1091
00:49:57,734 --> 00:49:59,834
<i>We officially had
each other's backs.</i>

1092
00:49:59,836 --> 00:50:01,502
<i>Maybe at this exact moment</i>

1093
00:50:01,504 --> 00:50:03,339
<i>we were shooting
each other in the backs,</i>

1094
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:04,607
<i>but you know what I mean.</i>

1095
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:07,612
[instrumental music]

1096
00:50:10,314 --> 00:50:11,714
Stop playing with my hair!

1097
00:50:11,716 --> 00:50:13,348
Okay, you'll be pleased to know

1098
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,417
the new uniforms
have been ordered.

1099
00:50:15,419 --> 00:50:17,553
- [all cheering]
- [applauding]

1100
00:50:17,555 --> 00:50:19,053
So they'll take
a couple of weeks to arrive.

1101
00:50:19,055 --> 00:50:21,325
We'll just have to make-do
in the meantime.

1102
00:50:22,426 --> 00:50:24,426
Coach, was it a problem

1103
00:50:24,428 --> 00:50:26,698
getting a toddler-sized uniform
for Mia?

1104
00:50:27,932 --> 00:50:29,397

you didn't take me in your team.

1573
01:15:09,011 --> 01:15:11,778
Because when we beat you today
and your squad realizes

1574
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:14,281
they've had to put up with
how awful you are for nothing,

1575
01:15:14,283 --> 01:15:15,549
they're gonna drop you so fast,

1576

1579

you can go back to being
the worst gymnastics squad.

we have a championship to win.

Abi is the worst.

1582
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:39,273
When I was training
before gym state comp,

1583
01:15:39,275 --> 01:15:41,474
Abi convinced me
that the venue had changed.

1584
01:15:41,476 --> 01:15:43,877
So my parents and I
drove to the wrong place.

1585
01:15:43,879 --> 01:15:45,946
And by the time
we got to the right one,

1586
01:15:45,948 --> 01:15:47,848
I missed my first apparatus.

1587
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:50,550
Charlotte won,
and Abi came in second.

1588
01:15:50,552 --> 01:15:54,354
Wow! Charlotte and Abi
really will do anything to win.

1589
01:15:54,356 --> 01:15:56,389
I know, right?
My folks got so mad.

1590
01:15:56,391 --> 01:15:58,591

from gym to dance.

could cheat her way to a medal.

01:23:58,073 --> 01:24:00,340
- We want to combine teams.
- What?

1722
01:24:00,342 --> 01:24:02,041
Listen, Abi is gone. Okay?

1723
01:24:02,043 --> 01:24:03,643
And none of us have any interest

1724
01:24:03,645 --> 01:24:05,612
in being part
of a team like that again.

1725
01:24:05,614 --> 01:24:08,648
We wanna go bigger. Nationals.

1726
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:12,419
But our team is too small,
and, frankly, so is yours.

1727
01:24:12,421 --> 01:24:14,987
If either of us
want a shot at placing,

1728
01:24:14,989 --> 01:24:16,756
we have to combine forces.

1729
01:24:16,758 --> 01:24:19,492
No way.
After everything you've done...

1730
01:24:19,494 --> 01:24:22,696
Hannah... she's right.

1731
01:24:22,698 --> 01:24:24,563
If we wanna go to nationals,
we need to double

1732
01:24:24,565 --> 01:24:27,667
the size of our team.
And they all have to be pros.

1733
01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:29,335
I mean, where else
are we gonna find that?

1734
01:24:29,337 --> 01:24:30,903
Em, it's Charlotte.

1735
01:24:30,905 --> 01:24:32,773
This whole time
we've been trying to beat her.

1736
01:24:32,775 --> 01:24:35,442
I know, and [chuckles] we did.

1737
01:24:35,444 --> 01:24:36,876
And I mean,
now that it's all done,

1738
01:24:36,878 --> 01:24:40,479
maybe it's time that we extended
our family a little bit.

1739
01:24:40,481 --> 01:24:43,750
But I'm not gonna do it
unless you're okay with it.

1740
01:24:43,752 --> 01:24:45,855
I mean, unless you guys
are all okay with it.

1741
01:24:48,589 --> 01:24:50,560
But Emma is captain.

1742
01:24:56,332 --> 01:24:57,997
Twenty-three!

1743
01:24:57,999 --> 01:24:59,499
- Almost a full team.
- [Caitlin] Twenty-three?

1744
01:24:59,501 --> 01:25:02,471
- That's enough to win nationals.
- [all cheering]

1745
01:25:03,538 --> 01:25:04,938
[Emma] <i>Until we take nationals,</i>

1746
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:07,441
<i>at least I have someone
to take my breath away</i>

1747
01:25:07,443 --> 01:25:09,542
<i>and a best friend
to watch my back.</i>

1748
01:25:09,544 --> 01:25:11,745
<i>Dad turned down his promotion
in California</i>

1749
01:25:11,747 --> 01:25:14,113
<i>and requested an extended
assignment in Adelaide.</i>

1750
01:25:14,115 --> 01:25:15,948

that letting other people</i>

<i>into your life
has its advantages.</i>

1752
01:25:18,419 --> 01:25:20,586
<i>I was really glad
I didn't have to say goodbye</i>

1753
01:25:20,588 --> 01:25:22,421
<i>to my new family,
but I've learned</i>

1754
01:25:22,423 --> 01:25:24,991
<i>that goodbyes aren't forever.</i>

1755
01:25:24,993 --> 01:25:27,794
