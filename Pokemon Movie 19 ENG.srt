 over 700 species of Pokemon.

 Pokemon have many different
    skills and abilities.

      called evolution,

 between trainer and Pokemon,

17
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:12,212

    be a Pokemon trainer,

913

  to make Pokemon feel safe.

            Pikachu.

931
00:49:43,913 --> 00:49:45,178
       This little one
    came here after being

932
00:49:45,214 --> 00:49:48,849
   abandoned by its trainer.

933
00:49:48,884 --> 00:49:50,017
             Pika.

934
00:49:50,052 --> 00:49:53,153

    happened before that.

935
00:49:53,188 --> 00:49:56,223
     He doesn't tell me,
       and I don't ask.

936
00:49:56,258 --> 00:50:00,193
The only thing I know is that,
right before its trainer left,

937
00:50:00,229 --> 00:50:02,930
   he gave Gulpin a big hug.

938
00:50:09,004 --> 00:50:12,973
 All of the Pokemon here have
been wounded by the selfishness

939
00:50:13,008 --> 00:50:14,975
      and lies of humans.

940
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:21,181
They may be laughing now, but
their wounds are deeply-rooted.

941
00:50:21,216 --> 00:50:25,919
    And that's the reason
    I can't trust humans.

942
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:30,123
   Pokemon are incapable of
    lying, but humans are.
