1
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,500
How long has it been raining?

2
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:41,501
Forever!

3
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,770
Not forever... no

4
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:49,471
For 100 years

5
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,050
They say billions of people once
lived on the earth

6
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,020
and the temperatures rose

7
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,990
the great cities fell

8
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
and this rain came

9
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,270
this terrible, toxic rain

10
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,671
Our ancestors saw it coming

11
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:46,772
a catastrophe

12
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,540
They built ECOBAN

13
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,250
the first living city

14
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:04,851
genetically engineered to survive
in a poisonous environment

15
00:03:17,452 --> 00:03:19,952
ECOBAN became our refuge

16
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:24,553
Our salvation

17
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:28,954
Survivors came by the thousands

18
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:32,555
Begging to be let in

19
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:35,556
but our ancestors turned them away

20
00:03:37,557 --> 00:03:40,157
Left them to die in the wasteland

21
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:44,858
The ones who survived became our workers

22
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,859
Mining the corbonite fields to feed our ECOBAN

23
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,360
Diggers we call them

24
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:56,461
The diggers need us...

25
00:03:58,262 --> 00:03:59,762
We need them

26
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:01,863
Everybody wins

27
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:04,764
But some win more than others

28
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:16,265
Commander Lock

29
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,770
The foreman says your putting the
mens' safety at risk

30
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:19,771
What?

31
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,970
he's concenred that they're...

32
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,070
Safety? What about thier quotas?
They're behind as usual

33
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,070
Damn it

34
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,270
Now we'll have to lose this generator

35
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,230
It's one headache after another
with this old equipment

36
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,190
Sir!

37
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:22,491
You're going to have to shut
everything down right now

38
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,400
To save my men

39
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,410
It's too late for that

40
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,840
Jettison the deck!

41
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,440
If...

42
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,010
If you do that I'll order a mass strike

43
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,880
I'm in no mood to negotiate

44
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,750
Jettison it now!

45
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,350
Over my dead body!

46
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,360
Really?

47
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,470
Alright then, If you so insist...
Jay shoot him

48
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,830
- That's not my job, sir
- No?

49
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,710
Do it now!

50
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,000
When you file your official report,
mention that he drew a knife

51
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,680
Go back to ECOBAN, I'll clean this up

52
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,820
You should have seen him Cade

53
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,570
He had a smile on his face

54
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,571
He enjoys killing them

55
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:55,372
they're like insects to him

56
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,330
Lock is getting more and more powerful
every day

57
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,000
There is no way to challenge his authority

58
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,470
Just do your duty and stay out of his way

59
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,050
Please be careful, you know I worry about you

60
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,720
I know

61
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,410
and I've always been able to
take care of myself

62
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:16,611
You should worry about the diggers,
not me

63
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,620
Our carbon reserves are dwindling...
fast

64
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,790
if ECOBAN dies someday

65
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,090
Do you think that diggers will
shed a single tear for us?

66
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,191
They hate us

67
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,860
Don't forget where your loyalties lie

68
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,700
For now, let's just try to relax and
enjoy the ECOBAN centennial

69
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:36,701
Come on

70
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,470
What's wrong with you?

71
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,540
I'm tired that's all

72
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,720
Go home and rest

73
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,820
I'll come up
as soon as I can slip away

74
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,960
Cade here, go ahead

75
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,820
We have an intruder alert sir

76
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,890
- What?
- Someone's hacking into the DELOS neuroplex

77
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,500
Dispatch alpha patrol...
now!

78
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,830
I'm on my way

79
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,640
System wide alert
alpha patrol to the DELOS neuroplex

80
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:55,141
We have a security breech in the
control center

81
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,180
What's he up to?

82
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,080
Sir, he's hacked into the cube data

83
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,780
- The DELOS file?
- Yes sir

84
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,120
Do not kill him

85
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,450
I want this rat alive

86
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,720
Run, try and run

87
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,860
Alpha team, the intruder has left the
DELOS neuroplex

88
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,590
There he is!

89
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,891
The target is heading east towards the basil canal

90
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:22,592
Alpha team, move in

91
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,380
We've lost him sir

92
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,580
No sign of him down here

93
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,380
Control room, stop the respiran

94
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,100
This device is decades old

95
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,970
Cabin alert in the cortex...
I'm on my way

96
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,480
Well well well, this rat's got wings

97
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,760
Jay, report your position

98
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,860
I'm in the Time-Capsule.
I think he's here

99
00:15:57,861 --> 00:15:58,861
Send back-up

100
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,210
Jay it's Cade,
Are you alright?

101
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:50,211
Acknowledge

102
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,930
Jay, are you okay?

103
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,270
Yes

104
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,170
Did you get a good look at him?

105
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,210
No I didn't, it happened
too fast

106
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,610
How could he have made it this far?

107
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,220
Commander Cade promised us that our
security was impenetrable,

108
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,320
But tonite our air tight security

109
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,360
was breeched by an intruder

110
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:00,661
who materialized like a ghost

111
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,760
and hacked our neural core

112
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,330
It seems we do have a ghost on our hands

113
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:09,131
only 1 man could have penetrated
the DELOS system

114
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,100
A man we all believed was dead

115
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,140
Dr. Noah

116
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,930
Yes

117
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,910
We found his old entry codes on the
device the intruder used to jam the respiran

118
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,750
But after 10 years, why would
he risk returning to ECOBAN?

119
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,250
To shut down the DELOS
neurogrid

120
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,820
and achieve what he failed to
accomplish 10 years ago

121
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,090
A final energy release

122
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,100
The old man said the bi-products of
our refineries

123
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,160
were killing the diggers

124
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,310
sulpher in the air, mercury in the water

125
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:45,911
He wanted to save them

126
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,270
So he tried to release ECOBANS energy reserves

127
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,450
and destroy the system he created

128
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:57,420
When we shut down the flow mid release,
He must have faked his death

129
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,720
That explains why we never
found his body

130
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,790
all this time, he's been hiding with the diggers

131
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,560
planning, preparing to destroy us

132
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:10,161
But we must destroy him first

133
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,400
He and the rebel army he has no doubt enlisted

134
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,610
We must strike them down before they attack
ECOBAN again

135
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,680
Rebel army?

136
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:24,281
There's no rebel army

137
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,520
Dr. Noah sent in only one errand boy

138
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,680
Today he got lucky that's all

139
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,580
Rest assured we will find him

140
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,050
and stop him before he makes his next move

141
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,990
This I promise to each and every one of you

142
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,900
We don't need promises

143
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,730
What we need is Dr. Noah commander

144
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,730
And you'll have him within 48 hours

145
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,530
In the meantime, I implore you to make no move
against the diggers

146
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,670
They may hate ECOBAN, but
we need them

147
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,450
If they're not already planning
a rebellion,

148
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,870
Lets not give them a reason to do it

149
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,250
Remember, they outnumber us
100 to 1

150
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,790
You want us to just sit around and simply
wait for another attack

151
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,720
We need to strike first, and strike hard

152
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,890
or face the consequences

153
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:14,991
We must not hesitate!

154
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:20,100
Gentlemen, our carbon reserves are
becoming dangerously low

155
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,960
Step up security and find Dr. Noah

156
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,110
Act quickly before it is too late

157
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:27,411
That is all

158
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,280
Lock

159
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,820
Prepare your men
just in case

160
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,770
You can't follow simple instructions

161
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,800
This would have been alot easier if
you hadn't tripped the alarm

162
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,510
Easier yes... but not half as
much fun

163
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,950
Go ahead, make jokes

164
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,220
By now Lock has probably got half his troops
scouring the wasteland for you

165
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,480
well at least you got the data

166
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,710
Toss it over here Shua

167
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,450
Nice throw kid

168
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,560
Well well , let's see what's new in that
bohemoth of a city?

169
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,330
What's this? The systems dying

170
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,980
It's running at one tenth capacity

171
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,210
Is it enough for an energy release?

172
00:21:37,711 --> 00:21:39,011
Perhaps

173
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,820
What's gonna happen if you release all
that power?

174
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,420
We'll blast open the sky

175
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,190
No, in ECOBAN. What will
happen to all the people?

176
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,160
Most will survive, but they won't have it easy

177
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,200
they'll have to use solar
energy and work shoulder to shoulder

178
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:01,201
with the rest of us

179
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,770
They'd kill us first

180
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,900
What do you care what happens to them?

181
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,580
Today, I saw someone I used to know

182
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,840
Oh?

183
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,780
Jay, she's all grown up and she's beautiful

184
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,880
She's ECOBAN

185
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,130
A girl? You're dead to them
in ECOBAN

186
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,230
So you better forget her

187
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,690
Now find that kid brother of yours

188
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,300
that orphan kid you take care of

189
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,010
It's too dangerous for him in the city.
Hanging around

190
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,100
with those rejects. Those petty hoodlums

191
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,040
He's ok, Let him pass

192
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,320
Come on, pass it Zed!

193
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,790
Hmmm.. hey you, cut that funeral crap!

194
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,460
Play something with a pulse

195
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:12,461
Don't smoke it all!

196
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,180
Hey Woody, wanna drag?

197
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,180
It's called tobacco

198
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:20,681
Nah

199
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:32,682
Woody

200
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,280
Huh, Shua!

201
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,850
Long time no see buddy

202
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,950
Woody, let's go

203
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,890
Hey Shua!

204
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,790
Big man with his big attitude

205
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,400
I tell ya, one of these days I'll kick his ass

206
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,400
Hey Moe, have you seen my uh...  propeller?

207
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,680
This?

208
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,220
No, it's about this size

209
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,710
Shua look what I got you

210
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,350
Great! So now those punks are teaching
you how to steal. Is that it?

211
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,690
Steal? No!
I found it

212
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,390
That's it, I found it. You said you needed
it for your glider

213
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,300
Don't hang around with them Woody

214
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,930
You'll end up stupid or dead

215
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,900
Now give me that harmonica

216
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:56,901
Ok

217
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,930
Oh wow!

218
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,000
What's that on your wrist?

219
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,870
A bracelet

220
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,870
Where did you get it from?

221
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,770
A girl gave it to me

222
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,970
Who is she? Your girlfriend?

223
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,860
Professor Noah says the sky used to be blue

224
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,800
'sky blue' he said. That's what they called the colour

225
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:44,310
My mom says there's a place where the sky
is always blue!

226
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,440
It's an island they call Gibraltar

227
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,820
You wanna see something?

228
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,290
What?

229
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,291
It's stuck!

230
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,340
This place is off limits

231
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,570
- We should go back
- Why?

232
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,080
I'm scared

233
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,980
Don't worry! I'll protect you

234
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,990
Come on Jay, I'm gonna show
you something

235
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,620
You will remember it forever

236
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,230
Now, open them

237
00:26:50,631 --> 00:26:51,831
Whoa!

238
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,010
It's incredible

239
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,240
How'd you know about this?

240
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,310
Professor Noah said this would happen today

241
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,520
In Gibraltar, people see this every day

242
00:27:06,521 --> 00:27:07,521
That's where I'm going

243
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,460
You could come too, I guess

244
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,740
That sky was so beautiful
it blinded our eyes

245
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,520
But it didn't last long

246
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,520
It disappeared
behind the clouds

247
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,260
That was the last I ever saw of it

248
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:42,961
And the last I saw of Shua

249
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,990
In ECOBAN they're living like kings

250
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,770
While we're dying in polluted slums

251
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,710
They call us diggers and they treat us like dirt

252
00:27:55,811 --> 00:27:58,611
We want air we can breath, water we can drink

253
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,580
Or the next thing we dig will be ECOBANS grave

254
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,350
Sounds like another riots coming

255
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,320
Better get out of here quick

256
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:12,050
You scared? My brothers not scared

257
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,420
Shua's not scared of anything at all

258
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,150
Stop calling him your brother

259
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:20,790
Shua was born in ECOBAN, he's one of them

260
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,230
Such a big man, such a big talk

261
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,170
Big talk? What'ya mean Moe?

262
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,430
He's gonna find Gibraltar.
Gibraltar! What is he crazy?

263
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,000
It's a myth

264
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,110
Forget that loser kid, and stick with me

265
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,680
I'll teach you how to
kick some ass

266
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,480
Woody! Where you go...?

267
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,550
- Woody!

268
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,560
These damn riots are no good

269
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,330
Bad for business, bad all around

270
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,530
Isn't it worse to do nothing?

271
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,970
Maybe. Then again maybe not. All
depends on your philosophy

272
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,410
Mine is stay alive

273
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,540
Hey, how'd you get half a handcuff anyway?

274
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,480
ECOBAN's security is coming!

275
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,890
Woody, where did you go? You had
me worried to death

276
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,460
You don't just run into a riot. You could
get yourself killed

277
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,620
Look at that

278
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,900
Stay here Woody...

279
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:05,901
Glider glasses

280
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,840
Come back

281
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:08,841
Cool

282
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,460
Hey, If you see Woody, tell him
to go home right away

283
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:45,440
Jay, you're headed right for the riots.
Let's turn back

284
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,260
Jay! Jay! Are you alright?

285
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,360
Jay. Come in, come in Jay

286
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,400
Shua?

287
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,640
Shua
it's you isn't it?

288
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,610
You shouldn't have come here Jay

289
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,950
I thought that you were dead Shua

290
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,020
The Shua you knew is dead

291
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,430
We are enemies, we have to be

292
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,960
Why? I don't think the
diggers are my enemies

293
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,970
So that's why you poison them?
Because they are your friends

294
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,770
Now when we get up there, you let me
do the talking

295
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:41,171
Cause I know how to handle him

296
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,810
Fools!

297
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,880
Go hide in there

298
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,920
Don't worry about it, if he gives us
the slightest bit of trouble

299
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,620
I'll just kick his teeth in

300
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,990
Oh hey, Shua! Good to see ya buddy

301
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,630
What's goin on?

302
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:06,930
Got a business proposition for ya...
Gotta move fast cause time is short

303
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,140
Goliath is waiting for you at the
Fantasia club

304
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,041
It's cool Shua...

305
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,440
Shua! You have no idea how much I've missed you

306
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,220
Kate said you'd been killed

307
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,190
but I always dreamed you survived

308
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,030
and finally made it to Gibraltar

309
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:57,520
Go back to ECOBAN Jay.
That's where you belong

310
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,090
Damn I'm gonna explode

311
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,460
I got a rocket in my pocket baby

312
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,260
Rocket huh?

313
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,160
More like a firecracker

314
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,530
- You want me to kick your ass Zed!
- Knock it off

315
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,930
Can't you see we're talkin business?

316
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,970
ECOBAN is planning something big

317
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,580
Every day, trucks are moving weapons into
the wasteland

318
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,240
Yeah and we're gonna jack em all

319
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,520
If you're willing to help with our plan

320
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,410
We'll cut you in

321
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,150
Help how?

322
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,530
Now, woody tells us you built a glider

323
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,520
You fly past the security post

324
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,100
creating a distraction and...

325
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,570
And?

326
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,870
And we sell the stuff on the black market

327
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,130
to our friend the butcher

328
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,770
How noble of you

329
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:31,480
You know Shua, we can't all be heroes

330
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,480
Heroes? You're nothing but parasites

331
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,750
praying on the weak to make a filthy buck

332
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,720
You make me ill

333
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,260
Son of a....!

334
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,760
Ok, now here's my proposition

335
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,000
go ahead and get yourselves killed

336
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,130
but leave Woody out of it

337
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,630
Anything happens to him

338
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,200
and you'll will wish you were dead

339
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,920
Big man, waving his big gun around

340
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,990
Next time I see him

341
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,420
I'm gonna wipe that smurk off
his face

342
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,290
Come on let's party

343
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,550
Give me music!

344
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,000
Woody, let's talk... man to man

345
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,110
Why? What did I do wrong?

346
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,170
Nothing, you're a good kid. It's just...

347
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,780
It's just what Shua?

348
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,580
What is it?

349
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,620
I might have to go away soon

350
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,720
You're leaving? You're going to Gibraltar
without me aren't you?

351
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,960
I'll be good if you take me with you

352
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,100
Don't!

353
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,930
There is no Gibraltar

354
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,470
You wouldn't like it where I'm going

355
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,140
Here

356
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,940
All yours

357
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,110
A gift

358
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,250
But, your girlfriend gave it to you

359
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,240
She's not my girlfriend

360
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,980
Shua, promise me something?

361
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,560
- Promise what?
- Promise that you'll come back for me?

362
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,660
We'll see each other again

363
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,190
Oh Shua

364
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,440
Jay found him and didn't report it?

365
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,700
Yes, sir. Who is he?

366
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,940
- That'll be all for now
- Sir

367
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,040
Mya, be sure to keep
this to yourself

368
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,150
Yes, sir

369
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,340
Our target is Dr. Noah's accomplice.

370
00:40:49,341 --> 00:40:52,241
He's hiding in an abandoned tanker in
the contaminated zone

371
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,570
He's dangerous...
shoot to kill

372
00:40:57,871 --> 00:40:59,371
Spread out

373
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:49,372
Jay!

374
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,240
It's clean, no one here!

375
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,740
Sir no trace of him below!

376
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:47,390
Why didn't you tell me?

377
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,930
He's nothing more than a murderer

378
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,270
Have you forgotten why he fled ECOBAN?

379
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,720
That one! Look

380
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,360
Where?

381
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,360
Oh yeah, no problem

382
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,040
Sorry we're late, traffic was a bitch

383
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,240
Who the hell are you?

384
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:54,290
Show me your pass

385
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:58,390
The pass?
Sure, which pass do you want

386
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:02,130
Look, this is a restricted area, military only

387
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,960
Turn this truck around

388
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,360
Oh yeah, that pass...
I got one right...

389
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,100
I said turn this thing around

390
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,170
I got a red pass, a blue pass...

391
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:14,171
Get out of the truck

392
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,250
Who needs a pass now?

393
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:40,630
Hit it!

394
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,050
Now!

395
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,890
Enough! Let them go

396
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,700
We're gonna be so rich!

397
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:33,180
Who gave you the authority to move
weapons into the contaminated zone?

398
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,220
We set a little trap Cade

399
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,760
A successful trap that caught a few
of Dr. Noah's rebellious vermin

400
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:44,460
Let me remind you, I am still in command
of this operation

401
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,290
Or have you forgotten Lock

402
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,930
Who is in command?

403
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,070
Oh yes. You should really
ask the governor about that

404
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,270
The stolen transport is at the north bay docks

405
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,100
Wipe them all out

406
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,510
And that is not a suggestion. That's an
order. Got it?

407
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,050
What's all the ruckus down there?

408
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,780
Sounds like a party

409
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,830
It is. They ripped off an ECOBAN truck

410
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,400
So why are you up here with a tired
old man?

411
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,360
Maybe I prefer your company

412
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,270
You're thinking about that girl again

413
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:28,140
Maybe I am, so what?

414
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,580
Tomorrow after the energy release, none
of that will matter anymore

415
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:33,970
Will it?

416
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,380
Don't be such a fatalist

417
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,470
If you follow my instructions this time

418
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:42,310
And activate the safety pod.
You'll survive the blast

419
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,250
You want to keep living don't you?

420
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,130
Of course I want to live

421
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,290
Well I'm glad to hear it

422
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:54,260
That's the first sensible thing
you've said in weeks

423
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,430
But if it doesn't work

424
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,440
I mean, if I don't...

425
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,141
Look after Woody ok?

426
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:05,870
You're coming back! You look after him

427
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:42,370
Gentlemen, we are open for business

428
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:46,650
We'll take everything.
Name your price

429
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,690
Cool, what's this one?

430
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,030
What the hell is it?

431
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,960
Why's it blinking?

432
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,940
You idiots!

433
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,340
- Freeze!
- Drop your weapons!

434
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,870
Drop them now

435
00:48:44,871 --> 00:48:45,871
No!

436
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,190
Move

437
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,460
Get away!

438
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,160
Don't make a peep

439
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:15,330
Just stay here till I come
get ya ok?

440
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:47,730
No more ammo! What do we do now?

441
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:50,170
Just stick with me

442
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,870
I'll get us outta here

443
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,110
Don't think, Run!

444
00:49:56,011 --> 00:49:57,311
Ow shit!

445
00:49:58,690 --> 00:49:59,910
Moe!

446
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:02,280
Stings like a son of a bitch!

447
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,220
Moe, Don't Move!
I'm coming!

448
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,810
Zed!

449
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,110
Zed!

450
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:38,850
I'm so, so cold

451
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:44,700
I'll go find Shua

452
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,100
No please don't go.
I'm afraid

453
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:49,960
Show me how quiet you can be

454
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,330
- You're pretty good at it
- I am?

455
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,440
Oh

456
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:59,980
Sure, just stay here and be quiet and

457
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,210
I'll be back

458
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,300
Hush!

459
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,730
On your feet, against the wall!

460
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,400
Against the wall now!

461
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:33,480
He's not the one we're looking for,
scour the entire place

462
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,170
Yes, sir

463
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,890
Where's Cheyenne?

464
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,140
Woody?

465
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:45,150
You can't see me

466
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,150
You'll be alright

467
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,320
How did you lose your sight?

468
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,630
I was born this way, alot of us were

469
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:33,380
Why Shua?

470
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:40,400
Why'd you have to come back?

471
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,830
I thought I'd finished you off

472
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,840
You didn't finish anything, you just
let me take the blame for you

473
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:52,620
You were to blame. You took Jay outside
ECOBAN, It was forbidden!

474
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,080
Cade, you and I both know what
happened that day. You grabbed the knife

475
00:54:57,081 --> 00:54:58,081
Enough!

476
00:55:01,282 --> 00:55:03,082
You killed the trooper

477
00:55:04,283 --> 00:55:06,083
You told them it was me

478
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:07,884
Jay never learned the truth did she?

479
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,550
She knows enough

480
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,720
She know you want to destroy ECOBAN,
that's all that matters

481
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,280
Woody!

482
00:55:27,981 --> 00:55:28,981
Shua....

483
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,550
Woody!

484
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,760
Jay move! Get out of the way!

485
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,910
I thought I was taking care of him

486
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:19,720
all this time, but I was wrong

487
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,520
He was the one that was taking
care of me

488
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,500
I'm Sorry, Zed

489
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,100
I'm going to ECOBAN

490
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,140
Who wants to come?

491
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,650
I appreciate it everyone

492
00:57:55,651 --> 00:57:57,351
Thanks

493
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,620
Let's help Dr. Noah bring the place down

494
00:58:00,721 --> 00:58:02,321
For Zed

495
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:06,390
Governor, with the diggers rioting, our refineries

496
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,590
are at a standstill and our carbon reserves
are rapidly being depleted

497
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,270
ECOBAN's dying, if Dr. Noah's men strike, it
won't survive an energy release

498
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,000
Commander Cade has failed

499
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,600
Now it's my turn

500
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:24,950
My troops will smoke them out of thier hiding places

501
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,410
And get rid if them once and for all

502
00:58:28,711 --> 00:58:30,011
This I promise

503
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,620
You will never find them

504
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,450
In fact, you don't even have to look

505
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,660
Keep your troops exactly where they are

506
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:42,600
There is no need to mobilze them at all

507
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,500
Just wait

508
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,010
Dr. Noah's men will be coming right to us, and
this time we'll be ready for them

509
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,440
They will not escape, and we will crush them

510
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:13,950
I didn't expect you to come back

511
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,960
We are both full of surprises
aren't we?

512
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,700
This is goodbye Cade

513
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,930
By tomorrow this will all be over

514
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,910
and Shua will be dead

515
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:34,950
Shua? Shua's been dead for years in
case you haven't heard

516
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,760
Jay, where are you going?

517
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,610
Jay!

518
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,590
I love you

519
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,460
You love ECOBAN

520
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:53,120
Don't forget where your
loyalties lie

521
01:01:29,821 --> 01:01:34,021
Wherever you are Shua,
that's where I belong

522
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:55,140
I want to give you something Jay

523
01:02:55,370 --> 01:03:00,040
A sky full of light
Sky blue!

524
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,240
Maybe we'll see each other again

525
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:08,810
Maybe we'll find Gibraltar if it exists

526
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,350
But if we don't

527
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,980
Look for me in the skies

528
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:21,320
And know you're with me, always

529
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:13,450
Commander Lock has takin control
of ECOBAN security

530
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,320
We believe an attack is eminent

531
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,890
From this moment on, you are
all on full alert

532
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,020
Well

533
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,690
Are the preparations complete?

534
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,760
Commander Lock, all troops are in position, ready

535
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:29,230
and awaiting your orders sir

536
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,130
Where is Cade?

537
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,670
Commander Cade is heading for
the DELOS core, sir

538
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,430
Good

539
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,960
Get these men in position now,
we're wasting time

540
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,630
Yes, sir

541
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,640
Alpha patrol, move out

542
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:03,660
If the diggers have any hope for a future, we
must unleash ECOBAN's energy reserves

543
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,430
Your task is to shut down the power supply...

544
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,600
before Shua releases the core

545
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:12,470
Good luck

546
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:40,400
Ok, it's dead ahead

547
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:43,900
Ready...

548
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,870
Fire!

549
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,760
Governor, our trap is now set

550
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:12,820
And so we wait

551
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,230
No, it's already begun

552
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,170
There, straight ahead

553
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:31,070
Hey, aren't you going too fast?

554
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,710
Not fast enough

555
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:55,630
Hold on a sec... wait...

556
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:57,930
Wait! The bridge has a gap!

557
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:00,360
That stupid geezer

558
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,600
Goliath hit the brakes,
what's a matter with you?

559
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:05,000
Noah told me to floor it

560
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:56,990
That was wicked! Oh god, did you see that?

561
01:09:57,330 --> 01:10:00,460
What a freakin rush,
let's do it again man

562
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,660
Hey Shua buddy, need a lift?

563
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:42,630
All set?

564
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:40,220
Ok Moe, now ya gotta really kick
some ass

565
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:24,490
So you finally made it

566
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:34,060
All that persistence for nothing

567
01:14:34,061 --> 01:14:35,061
Cade,

568
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:39,080
If you kill me...

569
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:42,040
There'll be others

570
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:43,870
Maybe there could be others

571
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:47,350
Except one thing. They
won't have Jay will they?

572
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:51,180
They won't take her away from me
the way you did

573
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:08,540
No!

574
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:10,641
Jay

575
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,470
Jay, don't!

576
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:20,120
Don't make me...
don't make me do this

577
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,250
Jay!

578
01:15:36,051 --> 01:15:39,851
Jay!!!

579
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,620
Grandpa, it's so warm

580
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:45,030
Yes it is, it is
