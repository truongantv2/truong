1
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:18,970
Ten thousand years ago, Antarctica

2
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,920
This is...

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,010
Doctor!

4
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,500
Great.

5
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,070
This is the bones of the green giant right?

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,920
Over there.

7
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,030
Be carefully!

8
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,450
The last shadow is...

9
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,160
Carla, hurry!

10
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,020
Come right here Get out!

11
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,770
Bleed!

12
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,580
Love squid ink!

13
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,150
Let me use the soundproof gun to deal with it, go away!

14
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,780
Dr., hurry up!

15
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Dead!

16
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,100
Right!

17
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,900
Golden ring!

18
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,760
Ten thousand years later, ToKyo

19
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,900
Now the heat has not shown signs of retracement. Ten thousand years later, ToKyo

20
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,850
Now the heat has not shown signs of retracement.

21
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,130
Today many areas remain above 35 degrees Celsius.

22
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,810
And according to the forecast hot sun is still prolonged...

23
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,710
In the central area, we note, there are places up to 45 degrees.

24
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,400
The hot sun is shining all over the country.

25
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,870
Tokyo has been continuously 2 weeks...

26
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,760
You need an ice-shingling supply.

27
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,200
Predicting the day the heat will be extremely hot.

28
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,070
This way I will be baked cooked.

29
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,950
It's not like you can do this kind of exercise.

30
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,640
You say that again.

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,080
Doraemi called to this.

32
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,380
Doraemon, are you okay?

33
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,270
That's good, it looks good to me.

34
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,150
Not good at all, it's hot here.

35
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,310
Hot? Strange too we.

36
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,900
As predicted by the robot,

37
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,010
This week he will meet the most unlucky in life,

38
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,010
He will die of freezing.

39
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,710
Frozen?

40
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,710
The result of the fortune teller is that.

41
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:43,980
Frozen.

42
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,180
Guess he will meet "ice accident". Frozen.

43
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,200
Guess he will meet "ice accident".

44
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,200
East hard because of ice,

45
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,200
You will have an ice-related accident.

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,470
In short, you have to be careful about what's involved with that tape.

47
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,470
Do not come near them.

48
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,470
He also has to watch out for penguins.

49
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,470
Your lucky thing is the star.

50
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,630
Do not know what to do.

51
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,810
Doraemi, you are easily affected by the movement too.

52
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,530
What are you talking about?

53
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,100
There is no proper eating ice that is hot dead.

54
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,440
Want to eat ice? Ice flowing... Yes.

55
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,930
I know there is a place to eat ice shakes delight.

56
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,190
Make sure to leave this place.

57
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,500
This is the place, come here want to take as much ice as well

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:29,740
The secret of nature, reveal the iceberg mystery. The iceberg, 27 kilometers long, travels from Antarctica to the Arctic.

59
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,360
Huge iceberg The secret of nature, reveal the iceberg mystery. The iceberg, 27 kilometers long, travels from Antarctica to the Arctic.

60
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,400
The secret of nature, reveal the iceberg mystery. The iceberg, 27 kilometers long, travels from Antarctica to the Arctic.

61
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:31,500
We go to eat ice cream delight. The secret of nature, reveal the iceberg mystery. The iceberg, 27 kilometers long, travels from Antarctica to the Arctic.

62
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,200
We go to eat ice cream delight.

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,730
That's how is it!

64
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,660
But Doraemi's fortune?

65
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,600
You are about to crash, need to avoid ice.

66
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
No need to worry, no need to worry.

67
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,050
Is this a giant iceberg?

68
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,490
Over there!

69
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,350
Nothing at all.

70
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,930
That was a newsletter more than a month ago.

71
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,030
Has iceberg melted yet?

72
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,190
Here, over there!

73
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,950
Hey, I just hit a wall of ice.

74
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,500
You look at this side!

75
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,590
Huge iceberg!

76
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,070
Great, here is the ice!

77
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,840
Come here you can eat ice shakes delight it!

78
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,460
The ice here is not eaten up too much!

79
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,200
Let me borrow a miracle door for a moment.

80
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
No need, I have a good security.

81
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,150
Ice sculpture stick

82
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,500
What is this?

83
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,510
Oil!

84
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,330
This is the furniture?

85
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,600
I was wrong.

86
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,880
Let's see, adjust the incremental mode.

87
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,510
Next we will add some more details.

88
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,180
Like this.

89
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,580
Here.

90
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,580
Great, into a sofa!

91
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,270
Advantage is complete, followed by soft sponge spray.

92
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,950
After spraying this up,

93
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,160
The tape will become soft and spongy, but will not melt.

94
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,940
Can I make another table?

95
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,920
Of course, it can be made into any shape.

96
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,450
Cool pleasant too heaven!

97
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,460
The recent summer is getting hotter and hotter.

98
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,040
If there is ice cover

99
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,890
The entire surface of the earth is good.

100
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,890
There it goes again.

101
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,590
But long ago,

102
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,810
It's just like you said.

103
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,680
The surface of the earth is covered by a thick layer of ice.

104
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,690
I know, is the time of the mammoth right?

105
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,680
It's far more than that mammoth time.

106
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,070
At that time,

107
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,660
The surface of the earth is covered by a very thick layer of ice.

108
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,900
Really?

109
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,500
At that time, both the mountains and the sea were covered by ice.

110
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,380
So no matter where you go,

111
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,490
Also see the scene as before us now.

112
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,040
What I'm saying is that the phenomenon of the earth is called snowball.

113
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,930
Extend those tens of millions of years.

114
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,710
In short, these are very distant things,

115
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,710
Since before there are humans.

116
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,570
Well, cool enough,

117
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,910
We go home for homework.

118
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,330
I have found a good place like this.

119
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,580
We play here a little longer.

120
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,430
That's right, we created a playground on ice!

121
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,770
Let's do it!

122
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,380
Use ice to make a ferris wheel and roller coaster.

123
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,050
What about exercise?

124
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,100
No problem, summer vacation is full of time.

125
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,890
Home! Home!

126
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,310
Then, just for a moment!

127
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,940
Great, no Doraemon!

128
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,770
Doraemon: Nobita And The Adventures To Antarctic kachikochi Sync: a lé - NetHD.org

129
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,500
Why stop it?

130
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,390
Nobita, what's wrong?

131
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,820
That's strange.

132
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,190
Doraemon, fast, fast!

133
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,810
Nobita!

134
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,620
Dangerous it!

135
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,980
Make sure!

136
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,590
Sorry.

137
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,870
Hey, let us play ice-skating with.

138
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,920
It is OK...

139
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,280
Let me build a more solid play area.

140
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,340
Okay, what do you plan to do?

141
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,840
I just heard something.

142
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,770
Hey, wait!

143
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,250
Extreme!

144
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,960
Doraemon dig the tunnel too deep too.

145
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,990
What is it?

146
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,110
What is this round?

147
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,360
The tunnel is about to collapse!

148
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,380
Dead, it looks like the iceberg is flowing.

149
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,380
Where did Nobita go?

150
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,040
Nobita Oh!

151
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,890
Nobita!

152
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,890
That's dangerous!

153
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,780
Doraemon!

154
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,940
Nobita!

155
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,060
Look!

156
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,310
Nobita!

157
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,980
What is this ice sheet for?

158
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,800
I found it at the head of the iceberg.

159
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,740
What is this?

160
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,530
Is Doraemon's security?

161
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,590
Not my stuff.

162
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,210
Sorry.

163
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,930
I find it like a bracelet,

164
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,540
Did someone drop it?

165
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,540
Then to the police station.

166
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,290
At that time outside of us there was no one.

167
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,960
It is frozen in ice,

168
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,310
It must have been there for a long time.

169
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,790
Yeah, that iceberg drifted from Antarctica right?

170
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,830
That's right.

171
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,880
So this is the Antarctic's drop?

172
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,160
Antarctica how can someone live?

173
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,720
Probably there is, there is an Antarctic base somewhere...

174
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,160
The back of this ring may have a bigger detector.

175
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,200
Is this

176
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,280
So how?

177
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,480
The device determines the tape life

178
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,760
Use this inscription to determine when the ice has frozen.

179
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,020
Super too!

180
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,230
Ten thousand years ago, of course.

181
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,720
Ten thousand years ago?

182
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,970
Is it so old?

183
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,150
Iceberg

184
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,280
It is precisely because of the snowfall of ten thousand years ago gradually accumulated,

185
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,660
Snow accumulation gradually formed into perennial ice.

186
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,510
Was it ten thousand years ago that was down there?

187
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,890
Not only that.

188
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,290
Since the Antarctic continent was discovered about 200 years ago.

189
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,950
So before that

190
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,690
Surely mankind has never stepped on Antarctica.

191
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,300
More than ten thousand years ago, the Stone Age.

192
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,840
Man of the moment

193
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,300
Still, it is not possible to make this exquisitely crafted metal ring.

194
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,480
Ten thousand years ago? In Antarctica?

195
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,600
If you can find the owner of that ring...

196
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,850
Discover new...

197
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,180
Bring the century!

198
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,900
Nobita, did you find anything frozen in the ice?

199
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,290
Let's go back and find it!

200
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,490
OK, let's...

201
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,490
It is too late today, tomorrow.

202
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,520
Tomorrow we will go back to the iceberg where to find it.

203
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,620
Too good, so tomorrow we will focus here.

204
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,810
Do not sleep!

205
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,160
Of course!

206
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,350
Good night, Mom!

207
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,430
Good night!

208
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,610
Nobita!

209
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,340
Nobita!

210
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,590
Who?

211
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,120
Wait.

212
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:41,000
Cold too, wait a minute.

213
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,420
Doraemon.

214
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,230
You will meet the cold limit, your luck is the star.

215
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,230
So you have to be careful with cold ice.

216
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,890
Has anyone dropped it?

217
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,390
This must be submitted to the police department.

218
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,310
Doraemon.

219
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,360
We're out here.

220
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,100
Where did you rush in the early morning?

221
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
Coming to Antarctica a little.

222
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,700
Have to go back to dinner.

223
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,830
Yes.

224
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,400
Atlantis.

225
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,400
I also heard him say.

226
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,400
Under the Antarctic ice sheet

227
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,380
Is an ancient civilization.

228
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,310
There are many legends about it.

229
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,840
Actually also possible.

230
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,520
This is the Atlantis civilization.

231
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,330
If there is a mysterious Atlantis civilization

232
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,100
So the metal ring was created 100 thousand years ago

233
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,790
Nor is it not possible.

234
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,170
It turned out to be so, this Atlantis

235
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,500
Where is Antarctica located?

236
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,720
That's Atlantis. If I know

237
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,250
It was not called a mysterious civilization.

238
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,910
Really?

239
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,600
Although I do not know much about Atlantis.

240
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,720
But I feel under the Antarctic ice sheet

241
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,560
It is true that something is buried.

242
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,600
Let me use this map

243
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,320
This is the location of the iceberg yesterday.

244
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,530
Now show the sea currents around.

245
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,110
Iceberg may have been pushed by currents.

246
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,750
If backward in the ocean current,

247
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,760
Take a large circle around the West Antarctic continent,

248
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,460
Will eventually come to this position.

249
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,090
The first iceberg was formed here.

250
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,820
So come on.

251
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,450
Atlantis?

252
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,470
No, that golden ring is not frozen here.

253
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,070
What do you mean?

254
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,570
Are not icebergs from here?

255
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,080
Next.

256
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,570
Time to form ice sheets in Antarctica

257
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,390
Was about 40 million years ago.

258
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,410
Snow turns into ice, ice slowly builds up into heaps.

259
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,380
Eventually formed a giant glacier also known as ice bed.

260
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,550
It moves,

261
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,940
Ice increasingly heavy,

262
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,920
It will be like water running from high to low.

263
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,710
After the ice floes with sea water,

264
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,110
Hit by sea waves,

265
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,650
Should be cut off,

266
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,430
Then form the glaciers.

267
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,670
It turned out that way.

268
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,620
So where is the gold ring frozen?

269
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,350
From here begin to go in the direction of the glacier

270
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,150
So it must have been frozen somewhere on this continent.

271
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,060
So follow this map

272
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,320
Explore the world under the ice only!

273
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,560
But I have not imagined yet.

274
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Does the star go down like sugar?

275
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,310
In short, from now on,

276
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,660
We will come to form icebergs

277
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
Show on this map look up.

278
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,310
What do you guys see?

279
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,380
Great.

280
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,310
Let's just leave.

281
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,260
Find Atlantis in Antarctica

282
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,410
Is the discovery of the century.

283
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,410
Look for the owner of the ring.

284
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,100
So next.

285
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,560
Are you ready?

286
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,230
Is this the Antarctic?

287
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,930
You can see also.

288
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,860
The front is half the other hemispheres.

289
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,230
It is winter now.

290
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,750
In winter, the Antarctic sunk into the darkness.

291
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,130
Months did not see the sunrise.

292
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,860
Always night?

293
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,950
Be careful.

294
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,700
The temperature of our place is now about 30 degrees.

295
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,090
The temperature on the other side is minus 40 degrees.

296
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,820
That is not possible.

297
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,820
We are going to die free.

298
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,800
Not afraid.

299
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,500
Wear this on

300
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
What is this?

301
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,840
How are you?

302
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,180
Wear this?

303
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,820
This is the extreme adventurous outfit.

304
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,900
Wearing it on tape will not be slippery.

305
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,830
Even to Antarctica is also warm comfort.

306
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,420
How?

307
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,250
Great, very good.

308
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,220
Pawn shop yet?

309
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,690
Now let's start.

310
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,530
Look, it's full of stars.

311
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,130
Look, there is a house there.

312
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,750
That is the research station.

313
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,240
Scientists conduct observations and work there.

314
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,680
This is my area.

315
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,000
Based on what to say?

316
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,860
To tell the truth, I still do not see the glacier flowing.

317
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,900
The glacier is only moving a few millimeters.

318
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
So the eyes are usually not visible.

319
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,950
Is that so?

320
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,350
How do we explore under the ice?

321
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,620
This.

322
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,200
Winding the cords.

323
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,840
what is this?

324
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,740
Yes, it is possible to explore the things buried at our feet.

325
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,340
Close your eyes and move.

326
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,400
So what?

327
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
What can be buried down?

328
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,400
Lemon candy can not?

329
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,650
Do not open your eyes peek.

330
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,610
Open your eyes, friction watch wire.

331
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,610
So what?

332
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,140
If friction is strong wire

333
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,910
It can find buried objects near us.

334
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,300
This means,

335
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,760
We should look at this deeper here.

336
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,620
We follow its instructions

337
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,540
It is possible to find items buried under ice.

338
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,430
It turned out that way.

339
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,340
Okay, let's go.

340
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,340
But how can this be done?

341
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:49,950
Present. This is a rope that will listen to music as you would like and a spectrum music dedicated to exploring the terrain.

342
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,750
First blow the song of it.

343
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,110
Now begin to blow the song forward.

344
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,950
Through the orchestra can reach speeds of 200km / h.

345
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,230
You are too slow.

346
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,970
What do you say?

347
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,520
Really, quick for me.

348
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,010
Are you ok?

349
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,060
This can not go on.

350
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,450
Camping here

351
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,910
How, now, lost the tent.

352
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,310
Should we really go this route?

353
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,380
I'm tired of dying.

354
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,310
Does Atlantis really exist?

355
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,090
Today stop here.

356
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,090
Stop the snowstorm and then we'll go back.

357
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,130
No, it's not easy to come here.

358
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,130
Nobita, you obviously did not do anything

359
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,560
That said so.

360
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,830
I still friction it forever.

361
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,090
There are reactions.

362
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,800
Go out.

363
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,110
Look at that.

364
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,200
This reaction is?

365
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,860
Is here.

366
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,800
Yes, the rat explores.

367
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,350
First use this.

368
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,530
How so?

369
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,730
What's up?

370
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,730
It is frozen.

371
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,030
Please save me.

372
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,990
Save me.

373
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,760
Looking at this reaction, below is a city.

374
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,420
OK, if so...

375
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,660
Great.

376
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,660
Can it cause little static?

377
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,140
Sorry.

378
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,910
Please drop me down.

379
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,540
This is an iceberg explorer.

380
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,570
It can crawl down the ice surface several thousand meters deep.

381
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,080
Invite everyone to stabilize the seat, seat belt.

382
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,080
Now.

383
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,850
Start the engine, complete the rotary compass adjustment.

384
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,420
Snow regime.

385
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,040
Are you ready?

386
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,990
What to say?

387
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,500
I'm ready.

388
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,500
Next.

389
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,840
Confirmed coordinates, iceberg explorer expands.

390
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,460
The horizontal axis, no wonder.

391
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,340
The state works well.

392
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,670
Increase 2% of X axis.

393
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:38,750
3% Y axis reduction.  &nbsp

394
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,350
Look, Nobita.

395
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,230
Ice here...

396
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,230
Just like the sky

397
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,200
Because the bubbles in the ice sheet reflect light

398
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Should create this scene.

399
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,660
This thick Antarctic ice sheet?

400
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,870
It is said that the thickest ice sheet is 4000m.

401
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,230
Beneficial, even higher than Mount Fuji.

402
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,860
It has been so deep and yet to come.

403
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,990
Where is this?

404
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,380
It probably came under the Antarctic ice sheet.

405
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,190
What is that?

406
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,680
What's happen?

407
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,610
Wait for me.

408
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,860
This is...

409
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,640
What is that?

410
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,670
Let's see.

411
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,900
Wait for me, Chai-en.

412
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,650
This is precisely the discovery of the century.

413
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,060
Nobita, you look at the pattern.

414
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,340
Same.

415
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,790
See where this is probably

416
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,890
Where this golden ring is frozen.

417
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,360
Where do we come from?

418
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,390
Around no see the entrance.

419
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,270
Looks like the rope is reacting to this tower.

420
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,100
But that reaction was strong before

421
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,100
Unlike of this tower.

422
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,070
Wait for me!

423
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,070
Are you okay?

424
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,890
This is also fall, it can not bear.

425
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,360
Look, Doraemon!

426
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,000
Both towers are frozen.

427
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,820
Turns out that the ropes look for this thing only.

428
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,830
See that!

429
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,160
Accommodation under the statue.

430
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,990
There is the entrance.

431
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,140
Should we get into the tower from there?

432
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,610
Let me pave the way for everyone.

433
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,480
OK, give this to you.

434
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,670
See me here!

435
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,870
Does this seem to be frozen?

436
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,630
Is there anyone here?

437
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,720
Looks like there is something.

438
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,600
What is the Atlantic repository?

439
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,970
Is a block of ice.

440
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,970
Which have the stars?

441
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,170
Give it to yourself.

442
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,850
What is this pile of hairs?

443
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,730
Anyway, I feel unlike treasures.

444
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,990
It moves.

445
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,180
Mammoth!

446
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,620
Looks are not quite like it!

447
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,240
Is not the Atlantic?

448
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,230
We picked up a gold ring, looking for its owner.

449
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,450
How are you?

450
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,900
Impressive, tickle, tickle

451
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,900
What's wrong?

452
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,690
Looks like he likes Nobita very much.

453
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,920
A bag, take me?

454
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,830
What is this?

455
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,220
Do you know what this is?

456
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,040
Looks like where ever, but where?

457
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,490
It's so cute, so cute! Mau stop!

458
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,190
Now I like to be close to Doraemon.

459
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,260
Nobita! Do you know this one?

460
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,230
Do not know! Was the first time.

461
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:55,720
Hurry up and see. There are steps leading downwards.

462
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,620
It's dark!

463
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,620
Where are these ladders going?

464
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:07,070
So use this! Disposable artificial sun.

465
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,020
This artificial sun can glow for 10 minutes.

466
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,230
Looks like there is something.

467
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,750
Come down and see.

468
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,340
Wait!

469
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,760
Wait a minute!

470
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,170
Hurry up Chai-en!

471
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,680
Inside seemed to freeze something.

472
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,970
But the sight here is not the same as the mammoth.

473
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,390
I say this is not...

474
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,280
What's the matter?

475
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,500
How can i...

476
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,790
I, why are you frozen here?

477
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,170
So what is this Doraemon?

478
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,770
The band here is dated 100,000 years ago.

479
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,990
Like the gold ring.

480
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,990
Freeze prediction.

481
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,710
Doremi guess is right.

482
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,720
Wait! I'm not frozen yet.

483
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
Melt the ice try to see.

484
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,620
Sometimes this thing is moving.

485
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,740
But this one...

486
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,530
What? Ra is a stone statue?

487
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,150
Why is there a Doraemon statue?

488
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,350
What's the matter? Orino

489
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:39,460
What are you calling? Orino is a wild boar.

490
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,110
How about the son of the mammoth call?

491
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,260
- Ancient.

492
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:52,130
- Mammoths that...

493
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,080
Ancient language

494
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,080
Do, Doraemon turn, turn into penguins then.

495
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,110
I'm not a penguin.

496
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,020
Ancient language

497
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:13,330
What is it ultimately?

498
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,260
Ancient language

499
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,460
Nobita!

500
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,300
Hurry up! Hurry up!

501
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,780
Already have! Super speed machine

502
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,350
Ancient language

503
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,510
Doraemon turns into a penguin attacking us.

504
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,760
What did this name just say?

505
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,490
Watch out is very angry.

506
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,970
100 thousand years ago what happened to this place?

507
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,440
Right! We are sitting time machine

508
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,440
Back to the time of 100 thousand years ago the gold ring froze away.

509
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,170
So can know what happened then.

510
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,200
That's right!

511
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,510
Torch! Then lead us to Nobita's room.

512
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,440
I forgot the door of time.

513
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,910
So how here?

514
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,910
No problem, there is another item.

515
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:24,820
Ring around the time.

516
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,860
Timing is 100,000 years ago.

517
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,840
Hurry up, hold on!

518
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,440
Use this item, although not change the location

519
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,620
But it is possible for us to move to any time.

520
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,070
45 thousand years ago.

521
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,650
50 thousand years ago. 55 thousand years ago.

522
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,670
60 thousand years ago. 65 thousand years ago.

523
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,580
70 thousand years ago .. 75 thousand years ago.

524
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,500
80 thousand years ago .. 85 thousand years ago.

525
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,040
90 thousand years ago. 95 thousand years ago.

526
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,940
100,000 years ago.

527
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,280
Was this 100,000 years ago?

528
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,240
Watch out!

529
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,240
The ice is gone.

530
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,000
The lobster is not seen anymore.

531
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,670
What's happening here next?

532
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,990
Remaining 20%.

533
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,990
Many people move the same

534
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,990
The battery consumes too fast.

535
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,080
It is OK!

536
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,990
In case of trouble, I prepared the battery.

537
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,270
Watch this party!

538
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,350
Opposite the light shining.

539
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,350
Here maybe open.

540
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,860
Why open?

541
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,640
See me here!

542
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,900
What are you doing? Help one go!

543
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,850
It hurts so much!

544
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:13,860
Where is this?

545
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,370
As a city! Still not frozen.

546
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,370
Great!

547
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,270
We have not reached Antarctica yet.

548
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,090
Strange too!

549
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,320
I miss Antarctica 100,000 years ago

550
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,140
Should have been frozen.

551
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,090
This is not the tower we climb?

552
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,600
The tower hits the clouds always.

553
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,440
So this is an underground city in Antarctica?

554
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,300
Is anyone there?

555
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,140
Atlantic people!

556
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,790
Listen to my voice?

557
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,860
You're careful.

558
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,770
It looks very old here.

559
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,370
Is there anyone here?

560
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,910
Otherwise we go down to see.

561
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,720
Down under see what!

562
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,910
Very dangerous! Can not do that.

563
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,950
Wait for me!

564
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,380
This city does not seem to have anyone.

565
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,050
Where are you going?

566
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,560
Sorry, let's wait a long time.

567
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,560
Mamuski likes to fly too.

568
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,540
Mummy

569
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,530
At him he called Mamu too so I called him Mamuski.

570
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,470
Where is this?

571
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,040
This place seems to be abandoned not so long ago.

572
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,040
What is that black and black thing?

573
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,230
Mom!

574
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,450
What's the matter?

575
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,290
Below there is water flowing.

576
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,290
Which fish there?

577
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:09,290
Do you hear anything?

578
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,890
Is a bang

579
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,250
Nobita!

580
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,710
Mom!

581
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,460
Where do you want to go?

582
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:55,920
Friend of Mamuski? Daughter.

583
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,470
Ask..

584
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:18,070
Ice glaciers

585
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,860
Atlantic, what is he saying?

586
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,790
Ice glaciers

587
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,910
What's the matter? What happened?

588
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,390
What is that?

589
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,390
Ice glaciers

590
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,700
What does it spray?

591
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,410
Ice glaciers

592
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,960
Cold water too!

593
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,350
Your legs...

594
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,270
Ice glaciers

595
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,700
Does not seem to be moving.

596
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,700
- Glacial icebergs...

597
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,450
- Wait!

598
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,770
She distracts to save us.

599
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,120
What the hell is that?

600
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,400
Is not squid?

601
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,150
Why Nobita?

602
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,150
Doraemon!

603
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,800
What is this?

604
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,410
Take bread to translate language.

605
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,410
Wait! What happened in the end?

606
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,150
Later and more elaborate.

607
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,730
East, frozen.

608
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,960
Ice glaciers

609
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,360
See? The attack of capital city capital of Chai-en himself.

610
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,930
His multi-attack attack was deadly.

611
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,190
What did you say?

612
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,290
Ice glaciers

613
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:27,280
Ice glaciers

614
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,280
Doraemon! Okay?

615
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,280
Of this, eat fast.

616
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,800
Just thank you. Are not you injured?

617
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,190
Why you, why do you know our language?

618
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,960
Chai-en's metropolitan city was destroyed.

619
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:03,050
That type of attack is not, not effective against the leucocyte

620
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,950
Octopus monster! Does that name have any weaknesses?

621
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,200
That's it... Our sound bullets are gone.

622
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,730
Ammunition sounds? So is it most afraid of sound?

623
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:13,730
Doraemon!

624
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:20,350
Okay! Maximum loudspeaker.

625
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,920
Do not! Completely ineffective.

626
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,920
Chai-en! Use this to sing.

627
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,100
Sing! What to do to sing?

628
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,130
That...

629
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,130
Star! You sing fast!

630
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:35,820
Really! If you guys say that, then...

631
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,640
The whale boy stopped.

632
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,860
It works.

633
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,860
OK!

634
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,540
The leopard who just heard Chai-en I was singing is running.

635
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,810
What does it mean?

636
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,270
I see that it is so touching that we do not want to hit us anymore.

637
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,560
Really! That's it.

638
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:40,330
Wait a minute!

639
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,390
Who are you guys?

640
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,640
We are...

641
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,870
Bao Bao's welcome dance.

642
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:35,500
Bao Bao close with the boys, showing that he is not bad people.

643
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,560
What's their name?

644
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,100
This kid seems to be lost. Do you know it?

645
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:45,330
Astray! It looks like Yutaka's brother.

646
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:48,250
But ear shape is not very similar.

647
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:52,810
Really!

648
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:53,750
Nobita!

649
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,540
Tell you! I'm Nobita!

650
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,000
This is Doraemon and Xu-ka.

651
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,410
I'm Xe-ko.

652
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,910
I'm Chai-en.

653
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,460
My name is Carla! It's called Yutaka.

654
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,910
We came from the planet Hioga Hioga.

655
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,120
I went to this monument to investigate.

656
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,520
Planet Hioga Hioga.

657
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,520
So I thought of the Atlantic.

658
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,310
What about that monster?

659
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,500
It's a monster rock monster! It is the guardian of this place.

660
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,230
Yesterday dropped something into the water.

661
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,250
Today when it came to find it was discovered.

662
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,690
Falling out?

663
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:32,730
Nobita!

664
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,060
We came here to find the owner of this gold ring.

665
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,830
Gold ring! Where did you find it?

666
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,600
Of course you are, it's good.

667
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:48,690
Actually, this was discovered in the ice of 100 thousand years later.

668
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,520
100 thousand years later, lies in ice.

669
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:55,660
We come from the future world of 100,000 years later.

670
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,350
What's wrong?

671
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,480
Do not talk anymore, they are rock bats. We were surrounded.

672
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,210
Rock?

673
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,480
Bat?

674
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,460
That's hurt! It hurts so much!

675
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:17,250
Do not rob me of my bag! Leave me! Please return me.

676
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:22,040
Inside my noodles and snacks.

677
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:26,560
Fine chocolate and my French fries! Return here.

678
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,230
They rob things glow and food.

679
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,210
Everyone hurry inside.

680
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:47,560
People are not injured?

681
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:50,020
Where is the yellow circle?

682
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,910
They are robbed.

683
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,520
Okay! Bag for items.

684
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,270
The item may not be at your disposal at any time

685
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,140
From this bag

686
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,100
It is fortunate to have you.

687
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,750
Where?

688
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,850
What's the matter?

689
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,870
Painful pain! That's hurt!

690
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,890
They run.

691
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,140
Okay! If so, this is possible.

692
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:24,830
Trace badge.

693
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:33,810
Just have this badge

694
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,770
No matter where they are, we can find them.

695
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:40,770
They fly into the tower already.

696
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:41,980
We quickly pursue.

697
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:43,410
Wait!

698
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:52,580
It's getting dark! Time to chase too dangerous.

699
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:53,640
It's dark!

700
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,020
Carla! You okay? What's the situation?

701
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,480
I found the gold ring.

702
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,190
But just recently, the bats were robbed.

703
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:06,560
Like this! It's getting dark! Come on.

704
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,100
Are you sure you can use your map to find the gold ring?

705
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,160
Of course.

706
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,500
There are guests, come immediately.

707
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,560
Guest?

708
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,750
You guys go back to our base.

709
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,730
Safety overnight.

710
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,730
Waiting for morning and then looking for gold ring.

711
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,060
Can your map lend me a little?

712
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,640
Torch.

713
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:30,640
This city is only 3 hours a day.

714
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:33,810
The time it takes to get the light is bright.

715
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,890
Another time is night time.

716
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,160
3 hours.

717
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,560
This place is very cold evening.

718
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,160
Night thunderstorms down to -100 degrees Celsius.

719
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,750
The boys in this way can not stand it.

720
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:45,870
Volume?

721
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,640
-100 dollar. This is where the devil is?

722
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:52,730
Our ancient ancestors are the planet Hioga Hioga

723
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,560
This city was built a long time ago.

724
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,350
But now there is no one else.

725
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:08,210
Things are about to be expelled.

726
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,750
Do not worry!

727
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,160
I accelerate, cling to.

728
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,370
Turns out, is the land vehicle under water?

729
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,370
Watch out!

730
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:56,540
OK!

731
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,790
We are here Welcome everyone coming.

732
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,060
Here are all friends of Mamuski.

733
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,410
It is our companion.

734
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,350
You come back.

735
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:17,940
So cute!

736
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,540
Follow me!

737
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,560
Why are you in the tape?

738
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:33,660
These are all hibernating.

739
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,370
Bao Bao should stay in the ice to rest for some time.

740
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,660
Sleep?

741
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:42,250
So was the time before Mamuski in the ice is also resting?

742
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:44,830
Bao Bao in the ice will not grow old

743
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,140
So they lived so long.

744
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:48,790
Evidence that Bao Bao was discovered

745
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:51,000
When they freeze in the comet and

746
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,500
Floating in the universe for millions of years.

747
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,790
Up there?

748
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,940
Welcome to our base.

749
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:13,270
What's wrong?

750
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,770
What are you talking about? Welcome to our base.

751
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,660
Doctor! Uncle Xabaru's clothes

752
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,190
Running to study?

753
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:25,270
Obviously, he told me to stay still and wait.

754
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,160
This is...

755
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,390
Uncle specify the search in the monument.

756
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,370
Do not you like that?

757
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:38,310
Really... Who told you that the injury was not hurt?

758
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,830
Doctor!

759
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:42,830
I watch! Now no pain anymore.

760
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,330
Right! Rarely have visitors come,

761
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,520
Tonight to celebrate.

762
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,910
Really?

763
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:52,750
Recently eat every day.

764
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,390
Everyone happy yet?

765
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,350
This evening everyone invited to party! There are also pudding bombs.

766
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:58,850
Bom?

767
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,040
Pudding stars?

768
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:03,190
Everyone goes to wash.

769
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:05,440
God

770
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,890
Toothpick!

771
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:13,770
I told my mother to go home before dinner.

772
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:16,600
Yes! My mother treats me again.

773
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,890
No problem! Wait after the deal is over

774
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,980
We use the time machine back that night.

775
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:24,440
What's the smell?

776
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:27,830
Torch.

777
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,810
To steal this one is all right. Wait a little longer.

778
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,240
Torch!

779
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,440
Wait a long time

780
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:40,620
We eat only

781
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,310
Delicious!

782
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,270
It's so delicous!

783
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,980
The cheese is just soft as candy.

784
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:57,690
Reminds me of the 5 star restaurant in Paris.

785
00:58:58,350 --> 00:58:59,140
What?

786
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:00,770
Children from the next 100,000 years?

787
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,230
Especially to bring the gold ring for us.

788
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,230
Planet Hioga Hioga is where this?

789
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:09,770
The planet Hioga Hioga is 100 thousand light years away.

790
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:11,940
Look at the other picture.

791
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,850
A white planet cleared.

792
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,520
Previously this planet was blue but

793
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:22,770
Now all frozen.

794
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,960
Are all planets frozen?

795
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,770
It's in the ice giant.

796
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,560
Giant ice?

797
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:30,690
This story is long.

798
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,310
Our ancestors are Planet Hioga Hioga

799
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:38,190
Have advanced science

800
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:40,690
Can be considered as the head of the galaxy.

801
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,290
Now these techniques are lost.

802
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,190
We can not inherit these techniques.

803
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:50,890
This is an insecticide caught in the monument.

804
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:53,810
But outside it is like insects, but

805
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:56,440
In fact, it is all due to the techniques of the ancients.

806
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:59,100
Is the same type as the whitetop monster?

807
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,500
Before

808
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:03,630
We have studied a lot of ancestors left

809
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:05,980
Developing that incredibly amazing technique.

810
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,000
But one day,

811
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:11,710
We do not carefully open the gate should not open.

812
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,090
Is a giant ice.

813
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:20,130
The strongest rock statue.

814
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:24,790
They are not something we can handle.

815
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:39,190
Everyone left the planet

816
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,690
We are not committed to leaving

817
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:45,440
Seeking to seal the ice giant.

818
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,920
Go through a long journey

819
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,590
Finally to this planet.

820
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:53,750
Find a gold ring of potential energy.

821
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,500
So is the item so important?

822
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,000
We have to rob it about.

823
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,340
Yes!

824
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,630
Why did the ancients create such terrible things?

825
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,880
Yes!

826
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,460
How does that happen on Earth?

827
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,340
Because if any planet has life

828
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,380
They can use it to freeze their own way.

829
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:15,920
Freeze stars?

830
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:18,920
How do not you lose your life?

831
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:19,960
Not.

832
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,880
Planet only temporarily frozen.

833
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,130
After the ice melts.

834
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:26,920
That planet would have a terrible shredding.

835
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:29,040
Is it the ice age?

836
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:30,710
Say so

837
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:35,210
Is that all the time the earth is covered by snow?

838
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,210
What's wrong?

839
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,670
What's going on?

840
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,880
Does the past of the earth have the same situation?

841
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,960
In roughly 600 million years,

842
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:47,040
Earth as well as planet Hioga Hioga

843
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:48,000
Also freeze white.

844
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,590
This situation lasts hundreds of thousands of years.

845
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,340
But after the ice melts not long

846
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:58,340
Earth life has great evolution.

847
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:02,150
As far as I know it is called the Cambrian explosion.

848
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,980
Most of the creatures at that time were primitive

849
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,770
And appear at the same time

850
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:08,380
So,

851
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:11,880
Are we present thanks to the ancients?

852
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:14,710
But the giant ice statue appears

853
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:17,520
When all are in an unfinished state.

854
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,670
I feel the planet is frozen

855
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:23,290
Most likely not related to our ancestors.

856
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:26,040
Meaning things are very wrong right?

857
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:26,960
That's it.

858
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,250
You do not understand anything.

859
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,500
Do not worry!

860
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:31,540
There are only monsters

861
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:34,790
Chai-en here will treat them neatly.

862
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,340
Is this also an ancient man?

863
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:44,250
That is the robot we bought on the planet Bonumera.

864
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,630
I hit the back button.

865
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,040
Very subtle.

866
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:51,400
The eye can also glow.

867
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:54,960
There is also this.

868
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:57,190
This eye can glow.

869
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:03,920
Eat some sweets.

870
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,460
This is a nail.

871
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:48,020
Heroes fight monsters

872
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,900
No matter how many times we brushed

873
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,250
He did not give up

874
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,630
Late game

875
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,960
Want to eat too

876
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:23,520
Too tight

877
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:25,790
This car can not hold.

878
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:28,940
Leave them too pitiful.

879
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,190
From yesterday until now not moving.

880
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:51,110
Inside is their lair.

881
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:58,540
The bunk of the bat rock.

882
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:01,020
Maybe maybe something interesting.

883
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:04,400
Uncle watch

884
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:06,670
Your feet are not lost

885
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,150
Stay here for us

886
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:12,770
But we have to use the machine Capture precious documents.

887
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,060
I told you to drop me down!

888
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,960
We'll be back soon!

889
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:19,170
The shooting job is for us!

890
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,880
What a way out.

891
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:27,380
What's going on?

892
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,420
Storehouse of ice giants?

893
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:33,170
Obviously, during the day,

894
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,400
Why gather so many snowflakes?

895
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,750
Look!

896
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:51,420
Must it climb so high?

897
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:52,670
That's it!

898
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,090
We're up!

899
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:55,710
Wait.

900
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,810
We do not know what will happen next.

901
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:02,560
To prevent any inconvenience, please use these insights to protect yourself!

902
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:04,540
Okay, let's go!

903
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,170
Everyone, follow me!

904
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,060
What's wrong?

905
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:12,980
I feel like there's somebody here.

906
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:45,860
We are near

907
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:47,540
Where are the Nobitas?

908
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:49,110
Where did you go?

909
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:57,790
How are you

910
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,460
It seems they are already lost.

911
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,630
No way, use this!

912
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:04,630
The trinket hunts.

913
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:07,340
It will tell us the location of the target.

914
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,540
Where is the yellow circle?

915
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,590
It does not know exactly anymore.

916
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,610
Is this party.

917
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,150
Accuracy is only 70%.

918
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:17,230
Looks out can not rely on it to find it.

919
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:21,360
You said the tru?ng tree look like it will be sad!

920
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,460
In short look to see.

921
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:25,460
Still have to climb?

922
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:27,380
Of course, hurry!

923
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:33,380
Stone, is it stone?

924
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:34,380
Come on, let's go!

925
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,250
It is all the springs are sprinkled on, delicious!

926
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,710
What are you eating?

927
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,900
Nor is it something to eat.

928
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:43,060
Your Earthmates,

929
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:45,060
Not so much to the ice giants eat it too?

930
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:48,610
Right! What is the giant of the ice?

931
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,940
A giant made of ice.

932
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,840
I only saw one close at close range.

933
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,110
They know how to absorb ice.

934
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,060
Then bigger and bigger.

935
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,670
Giant ice!

936
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,040
I go to inform everyone.

937
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,880
That day, our city was frozen like that!

938
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:31,750
But just get the gold ring that is okay.

939
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,360
It can make a giant Ice back into ice piles.

940
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,940
Torch! So I'll give you siro.

941
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:38,630
What is delicious?

942
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:39,730
That's hurt!

943
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:44,000
Where is Doraemon?

944
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:49,420
Where?

945
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,130
Nobita, this party!

946
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:58,960
I know.

947
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,420
You go before that!

948
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,710
This is the cave of the rock fall.

949
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,250
These are the items they collect.

950
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,420
Is not that Suneo and Chaien's bookbag?

951
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,540
Anyhow...

952
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:48,460
Found, the gold ring!

953
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:51,710
Who are you? Dare to be so big liver?

954
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:53,040
Dare to move on my belongings.

955
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:56,420
Who are you?

956
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:14,090
What's going on?

957
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,670
The body of the ice giant is recovering.

958
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,420
Shizuka

959
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:38,960
Probably in the near future!

960
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,210
You're too slow!

961
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,290
Doraemon

962
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,190
What is this

963
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:56,920
No good

964
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,290
Where are the Nobitas?

965
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,060
Torch!

966
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:12,380
Where do we go

967
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:14,400
Doraemon

968
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,270
Nobita, you know?

969
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:17,000
This side, this side

970
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,400
Machine locates here!

971
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:22,960
Really?

972
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:24,590
What is the end of it?

973
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,170
Must fall down from above.

974
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,020
The golden ring is definitely up there.

975
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:39,310
Do you hear anything?

976
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,920
No, not hear anything.

977
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:44,040
Nobita!

978
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,290
In the end, where does it want to take them?

979
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:54,380
As a trap, it is going to kill them!

980
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,170
Nobita!

981
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:03,710
Have to think of a way to let them know!

982
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,810
Now you need the security now, give yourself away!

983
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,020
Wait!

984
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:34,880
Do not let him cheat!

985
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,000
That name is fake.

986
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,230
There are these two Doraemon!

987
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:43,500
What's going on?

988
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,230
Hateful!

989
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:48,000
I'm the real Doraemon.

990
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,290
No, I'm real!

991
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:56,130
Which name is the fake name?

992
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,440
Let me handle him.

993
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:02,000
Look at the other Doraemon!

994
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,250
His bell and magical bag made of ice.

995
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:07,440
That's it!

996
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,290
Real doraemon

997
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,000
You will be able to get the money back from the magic bag, get it!

998
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:12,650
No problem.

999
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:16,190
You guys go watch!

1000
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:17,520
Correct.

1001
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:18,960
That's the Doraemon insignia.

1002
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,270
Say so,

1003
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:23,880
That name is fake.

1004
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:24,790
Not that.

1005
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,540
His magic bag is stolen.

1006
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:27,630
That's true!

1007
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,810
This is also likely that!

1008
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:35,060
Yes, see who you can say my name right.

1009
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:37,310
There is also my name.

1010
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,460
That's too simple!

1011
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,310
Bottle...

1012
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:46,710
What's going on?

1013
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:48,630
It does not seem to speak.

1014
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:51,340
As Chaien and Suneo.

1015
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,210
I said that.

1016
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,090
That name is definitely fake.

1017
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:55,540
That fake name!

1018
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:56,920
I will destroy you!

1019
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:58,440
P! P!

1020
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:01,420
Where did that name come from?

1021
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,290
E the truth is hidden in the stone tower.

1022
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:05,210
So what to do?

1023
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:07,590
Use the speedy flashlight to freeze him.

1024
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,630
Looks like it is extremely angry.

1025
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:15,110
Let us see your true face, fake.

1026
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,840
I see that he is really pitiful!

1027
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:21,590
Still not possible now Surely he is a fake.

1028
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,670
What are you saying?

1029
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:25,730
Bells and bags are made of ice,

1030
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:28,000
Can not say our name.

1031
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,940
But...

1032
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:32,310
Okay, I know.

1033
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,560
Let him decide to go!

1034
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:35,420
Right!

1035
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,500
You are the one who understands Doraemon most Nobita!

1036
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,130
I'm?

1037
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:49,460
Nobita, be careful little!

1038
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:13,400
I see that both of them are real!

1039
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:17,360
What are you talking about? There is no such thing!

1040
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,860
OK! Please freeze that name again!

1041
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:23,310
Do not!

1042
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:25,710
He quickly avoided it.

1043
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:26,730
Carla!

1044
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:31,420
Although the bell and the magic bag are not the same,

1045
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:33,790
But I see that he is real!

1046
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:35,670
Do not say your names well,

1047
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,960
Doraemon is Doraemon!

1048
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:41,710
Nobita!

1049
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:45,000
What are you kidding

1050
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:48,810
What are you talking about?

1051
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:50,400
Give it to me!

1052
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:51,900
What are you doing?

1053
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:01,360
Nobita!

1054
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:07,360
Doraemon!

1055
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:10,560
When you were first saved me.

1056
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,270
Thank you!

1057
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:16,340
That was so dangerous.

1058
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:19,210
If he saved Nobita, then proved...

1059
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:22,790
The other side is a fake!

1060
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:43,210
Freeze it!

1061
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:48,520
Finally say it!

1062
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:50,520
Stay away!

1063
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,960
Hurry up, hurry up!

1064
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,420
Stop me!

1065
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,400
It wants to harm us being stabbed by the bandit.

1066
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:15,170
May have Doraemon save us.

1067
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,540
That's right, this place!

1068
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:23,590
Is not that where our journey begins this time?

1069
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:27,730
The true face of the fake name,

1070
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,610
It is the penguin.

1071
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:33,060
So keep it freezing here!

1072
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,770
Dare say so

1073
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,290
100,000 years later did not you release it yourself?

1074
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,090
Is that so?

1075
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:43,310
So now I have to give it a new match.

1076
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:46,020
Doing so will change that history.

1077
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,540
Just freeze it like that.

1078
01:17:56,290 --> 01:17:58,590
May have you, helped us.

1079
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:00,040
Doraemon!

1080
01:18:00,130 --> 01:18:01,170
I really apologized to you!

1081
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,000
We are not good.

1082
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:05,380
No problem, no other way.

1083
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,540
What about the gold ring?

1084
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:12,540
Side.

1085
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:15,630
It's about Doraemon.

1086
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,190
What is...

1087
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,000
This is not...

1088
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,790
Gold ring!

1089
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:26,290
That guy put the gold ring in his magic pocket.

1090
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:27,750
Carla!

1091
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,420
Take it!

1092
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,110
Thanks, thank you everyone!

1093
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:43,990
What's going on?

1094
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:47,620
No or it's late!

1095
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:54,560
Doctor, we got the gold ring!

1096
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:55,970
Very good!

1097
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,930
But definitely have to return the gold ring for the ice giant.

1098
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:00,180
Return?

1099
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:03,410
This ice giant, completely unfinished.

1100
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:05,240
That was soon completed.

1101
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:08,540
But before the soul was liberated it was sealed.

1102
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:12,660
As we did not carefully release the seal!

1103
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,720
What is it?

1104
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:16,080
So on,

1105
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,870
The planet will freeze it!

1106
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:19,890
How can?

1107
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,140
Look over there!

1108
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:26,490
The ice giant is slowly awakening.

1109
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:27,740
Carla!

1110
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,700
Now there is still time,

1111
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:31,450
Definitely have to return the gold ring!

1112
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:34,740
If now returned, the gold ring will be how?

1113
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,240
Not clear, but no time to hesitate!

1114
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:38,870
But without this golden ring,

1115
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:40,620
Can not solve snow and ice for all the planets!

1116
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:41,990
What are you talking about?

1117
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:44,910
The Earth is about to turn into a snowball?

1118
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:45,990
Is that right?

1119
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,040
But...

1120
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,040
This is the gold ring!

1121
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,120
No, not in time!

1122
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:56,220
There are many holes in the sky!

1123
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:57,600
That is...

1124
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:07,040
Giant ice!

1125
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:08,370
That is...

1126
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:09,700
He's awake!

1127
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,540
Obnoxious! I will not let it freeze the earth.

1128
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:20,660
No, it will be lost.

1129
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,040
Everyone hurry into the tower, hurry up!

1130
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:35,490
Dare to do that? What's going on?

1131
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:39,080
Its ears...

1132
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:42,260
Give your bag, inside with medicine.

1133
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:45,220
Do not worried. At this level, healing quickly.

1134
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,060
Doctor.

1135
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,100
I have to go back to base, Paopao is okay.

1136
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:52,140
Now we are back to base.

1137
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:55,080
Do not. Now it's too dangerous.

1138
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:11,410
The whole city is frozen.

1139
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:12,200
Mau withdraw.

1140
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:18,390
What should I do? It's getting dark.

1141
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:21,890
Right. Use lumbar time away. Everyone hurry up.

1142
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,470
What are you going to do?

1143
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:26,410
We will now reach ten thousand years later to avoid accidents.

1144
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,740
Everyone is firmly attached.

1145
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:44,580
Doraemon!

1146
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:46,060
Nobita!

1147
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,950
Nobita!

1148
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:54,410
Doraemon!

1149
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:03,040
Doraemon!

1150
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:08,870
That's hurt.

1151
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:17,160
Is this place ten thousand years later?

1152
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:18,390
People wait.

1153
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:20,870
I have to bring Yukatan and Doraemon here.

1154
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:23,370
0% left.

1155
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:24,580
Low battery.

1156
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:26,120
Why not?

1157
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:31,160
The screen does not light up anymore.

1158
01:23:33,330 --> 01:23:37,490
Are we now under the Antarctic ice sheet?

1159
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:41,990
Are we guys stuck here forever?

1160
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:46,120
After all, Carla and the others should not come here.

1161
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,290
Yes. It is all in you

1162
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:50,180
So now it's like this.

1163
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,200
I...

1164
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,660
You think of a way, Carla.

1165
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:56,850
Do not do that.

1166
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,990
Carla and everyone just want to save their planet only.

1167
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,580
They also have no way.

1168
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:02,950
Nobita.

1169
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:05,660
Yes. You two do not do that.

1170
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,060
Obnoxious!

1171
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,140
Why did you hit me?

1172
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:13,350
Mommy!

1173
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:16,560
Mommy!

1174
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:34,160
So cold. It does not seem to work.

1175
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:36,660
Doraemi's prediction is fulfilled.

1176
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:39,330
The waist of time is also out of battery.

1177
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:42,240
Continuing this I will also be frozen.

1178
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:46,240
That's right. I can not easily give up.

1179
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:48,830
Nobita needs care later.

1180
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:52,410
Just bring your spare battery of the waist time

1181
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:53,370
To ten thousand years later...

1182
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:58,540
Looks like to see where.

1183
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:06,790
Arrived. Up top

1184
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:13,370
Paopao you just need to be in the ice to be able to hibernate.

1185
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:15,290
If you can not escape, at least you can live on.

1186
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:20,310
Even though I'm a high-end person, I can not hibernate.

1187
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:27,510
Hibernate? Wait. This battery department...

1188
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,950
Your lucky thing is the star.

1189
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,200
Right. I got it.

1190
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:39,870
The widgets can Can you use only that much?

1191
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:43,160
Up to the top, you will probably find a car tuner.

1192
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,740
But it was broken.

1193
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,370
Are these enough for us to save people?

1194
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,490
This is the battery of the waist time.

1195
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:59,100
Where is the feeling?

1196
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:05,040
Mosuke, is your bag still here?

1197
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,870
Where is that bag?

1198
01:26:08,370 --> 01:26:10,660
This bag was frozen with Mosuke.

1199
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:13,620
That is the doctor's bag.

1200
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:17,240
Probably Yukatan wearing that bag.

1201
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:19,040
Speak well to say back,

1202
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:22,450
Why did Mosuke hibernate here?

1203
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:26,080
Do you know what this is about?

1204
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:32,330
Mosuke, Yukatan...

1205
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,370
For me

1206
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:37,620
Looks like already seen. But where is it?

1207
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:40,310
When I felt soft hair, I called it Mosuke.

1208
01:26:44,830 --> 01:26:46,100
What is that?

1209
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:50,790
Doraemon!

1210
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:53,240
I knew. That's how is it.

1211
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:56,470
My dear, I can go save Doraemon.

1212
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:58,740
What's going on?

1213
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:05,290
It is safe in the ice.

1214
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:09,390
Yukatan, bring this to Nobita.

1215
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,370
Why does this bag have batteries?

1216
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:21,790
It was Doraemon who gave it to Mosuke.

1217
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,330
Get started.

1218
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:30,410
But where did Mosuke come from?

1219
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:32,410
Mosuke is Yukatan being Doraemon

1220
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:35,330
Frozen for hibernation ten thousand years ago.

1221
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:39,740
You say Mosuke is Yukatan?

1222
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:43,490
Incorrect. It must be said that Yukatan is Mosuke.

1223
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:45,240
But the colors are not the same.

1224
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:48,790
Maybe during hibernation its coat color has turned blue.

1225
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:52,290
We go here Returning to ten thousand years ago.

1226
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:54,450
But how are you going to deal with the monster?

1227
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:57,080
Yes. Must handle that name already.

1228
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,290
How to handle it?

1229
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:00,830
We have a gold ring.

1230
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:04,040
Use this ring to seal the other guy.

1231
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:06,580
Would not that be Carla?

1232
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,910
I can not save the planet Hyogahyoga

1233
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,910
But leave your planet frozen.

1234
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,240
Carla.

1235
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:14,870
Torch. Let's go.

1236
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:17,910
How to reach the monster?

1237
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:21,660
Give it to yourself. I have a good way.

1238
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:26,740
I knew. In short, it is okay.

1239
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:29,410
Everyone is ready?

1240
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:36,200
We're off

1241
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:38,700
Save our Earth!

1242
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:56,360
Chong bamboo is also lost.

1243
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:06,940
It's dead

1244
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:21,460
It's Jaian and Suneo!

1245
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:23,380
Jaian, turn left.

1246
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:27,940
Doing so can enclose it, so it slows down.

1247
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,030
Brain!

1248
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:30,130
This side

1249
01:29:31,190 --> 01:29:33,170
Pin arrived.

1250
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,490
Nobita! Shizuka!

1251
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:41,070
You guys are coming.

1252
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:43,780
Brizzaga is controlled by Jainan.

1253
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:44,650
We have to endure time.

1254
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:56,610
Ready? We make war on schedule.

1255
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,530
Come here.

1256
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:02,740
This side

1257
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,900
Sponge nozzle

1258
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:26,280
Do not let you escape so easily.

1259
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:27,490
Good job.

1260
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:28,490
What's up?

1261
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:36,590
It grows wings.

1262
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:38,710
This has not been mentioned before.

1263
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:48,570
Foam sprays are also useless.

1264
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:49,690
That name...

1265
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:52,170
Pierced through the arched porch straight to the ground.

1266
01:30:58,440 --> 01:30:59,360
Hurry up.

1267
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:01,490
Everyone hid behind me.

1268
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:04,010
Suneo!

1269
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:05,940
Even shields also...

1270
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,110
I... I can not stand it.

1271
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:10,740
Look across.

1272
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:20,900
Its movement slows down.

1273
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:21,860
That is...

1274
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:24,030
Doraemon.

1275
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:27,570
I use the automatic wallet in the lake to come here

1276
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:29,240
So that is.

1277
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,090
Its body is made of ice.

1278
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,990
Meeting water will weaken.

1279
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:35,880
Nobita, time is here!

1280
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:37,130
We burst out, Carla!

1281
01:31:56,030 --> 01:31:56,800
Carla!

1282
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:23,650
The light fades away.

1283
01:32:29,530 --> 01:32:31,070
Great.

1284
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:17,860
This side

1285
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:18,690
Torch.

1286
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,820
Found it, Jaian.

1287
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:32,860
Also noodle package I like to eat the most.

1288
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,860
His high-profile chocolates.

1289
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:37,860
Jaian, look at that.

1290
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:39,860
These rings are supposed to be...

1291
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:54,320
Sorry, Carla.

1292
01:33:55,490 --> 01:33:56,240
No problem.

1293
01:33:56,690 --> 01:33:58,240
I can go to other planets looking for.

1294
01:33:59,490 --> 01:34:00,360
Carla!

1295
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:02,240
The universe is very large.

1296
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,860
I will definitely find out

1297
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:06,650
Right. Jaian and Suneo where?

1298
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:08,320
Looks like they...

1299
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,610
Where are you going?

1300
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:16,030
People look at this.

1301
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:18,940
We found in the bat's den.

1302
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:21,030
They are all collected by them.

1303
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,190
Gold ring.

1304
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:27,860
This is...

1305
01:34:28,650 --> 01:34:31,210
These things are very valuable research.

1306
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,170
Not yet able to save the planet Hyoga Hyoga.

1307
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:37,710
That's good, Carla.

1308
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:39,340
Thank you, Nobita.

1309
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:40,940
Thank you guys.

1310
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:44,280
I brought the children to the ground.

1311
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:46,440
People pick up the car.

1312
01:35:06,030 --> 01:35:08,590
Letting Yukatan be like that?

1313
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:09,820
It is OK.

1314
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:12,210
Ten thousand years later you will wake it up.

1315
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,650
Ten thousand years?

1316
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:16,240
To them it is just a nap.

1317
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:04,110
Good evening to you. [Ten thousand years - one week later]

1318
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:06,360
Promotion activities are about to begin.

1319
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:07,940
Really?

1320
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:09,940
Strong healthy trend is very...

1321
01:36:09,990 --> 01:36:11,650
After several hot days,

1322
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:15,400
Tomorrow will begin to welcome fresh air.

1323
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:19,420
Nobita!

1324
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,530
What are you doing?

1325
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:28,570
I'm watching the celestial body.

1326
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:33,490
The doctor told me coordinates Of Hyoga Hyoga planet.

1327
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:34,990
I looked at the standard.

1328
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:37,940
This planet is about ten thousand light years away.

1329
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:40,990
So now we can See it of ten thousand years ago.

1330
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:43,610
Is this Hyoga Hyoga?

1331
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:46,860
White is good. It's frozen.

1332
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:48,880
You look closely.

1333
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:54,740
See it.

1334
01:36:54,990 --> 01:36:56,690
The tape starts melting.

1335
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:59,960
Probably the doctor's research has been successful.

1336
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:08,960
That's good, Carla.

1337
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:21,380
Finally it was already cool.

1338
01:37:21,490 --> 01:37:23,490
Summer is about to end?

1339
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:26,150
Nobita, Doraemon!

1340
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:27,280
Let's eat.

1341
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:29,050
Yes.
