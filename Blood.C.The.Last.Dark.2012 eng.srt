1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,150


3


4
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,110


5
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,790
Thank you for waiting.

6
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,520
The train bound for Shin Ikebukuro will arrive at Platform 1.

7
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,660
Please watch your step while boarding.

8
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,600
Thank you for using Tokyo Metro, Shin Marunouchi line.

9
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,020
This train is bound for Shin Ikebukuro.

10
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,440
We have an announcement to make.

11
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,300
Tokyo Metro is cooperating with the city of Tokyo

12
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,760
and will take custody of anyone under 20 years old after 9 PM,

13
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,910
in accordance with the Tokyo Juvenile Protection Curfew Ordinance.

14
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,220
Anyone under 20 years old is prohibited from going out after 9 PM...

15
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:37,460
without being accompanied by their parents or carrying their consent form.

16
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,020
If you are under 20 years old and do not have a consent form,

17
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,500
please come to a ticket window or seek an attendant for your safety.

18
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,560
Do you wish... to be eaten by me?

19
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,040
The train is coming to Platform 1.

20
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,260
Please wait behind the white line.

21
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,000
They are moving around quite visibly.

22
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,260
Shall we go?

23
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,220
Wait a minute.

24
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,970
Gone? Escaped?

25
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,860
What?

26
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,620
They said it was recaptured by another unit.

27
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,180
Where?

28
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,770
Who... who are you?

29
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,940
Confirming the target is destroyed.

30
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,990
There are two witnesses.

31
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,580
Recovery unit, hurry.

32
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,270
A dead body, dead body.

33
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,760
You, who are you?

34
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,900
Fujimura-kun?

35
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,520
Mana-chan?

36
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,960
What? Hiiragi.

37
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,970
You...!

38
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,440
This is the Old Ones.

39
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,530
The Old Ones.

40
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,520
Why are you here?

41
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,910
Matsuo-kun.

42
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,280
Fuji, let's get out of here.

43
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,790
Y-Yes.

44
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,790
Hiiragi.

45
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,050
Dammit. Hurry up!

46
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,830
Drive.

47
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,780
What do you want?!

48
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,660
You are...

49
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,710
We'll be caught..

50
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,160
Dammit!

51
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,000
Witnesses are escaping by car.

52
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,010
We are now in pursuit.

53
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,340
Ground units, hurry to the scene.

54
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,760
They're chasing us!

55
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,360
Point the way!

56
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,860
Come in, SIRRUT, this is Fujimura.

57
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,240
We are being chased by a Tower helicopter!

58
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,080
H-Help!

59
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,330
Yanagi-san!

60
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,960
Calm down, Fujmura-kun.

61
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,700
Yes.

62
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,710
We will send you the escape route within one minute.

63
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,490
Meanwhile, send us the information you have acquired.

64
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,390
U-Understood.

65
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,770
Tsuki-chan, gain control of the traffic system immediately.

66
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,910
Yes.

67
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,640
Also, hack into the District of Land and Transportation Bureaus' computer system.

68
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,860
Yes.

69
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,190
Is it all right, Mogari-san?

70
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,230
Yes.

71
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,060
There!  Right, right!

72
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,980
Stupid! That's a one-way street!

73
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,460
I... I'm sorry.

74
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,570
I've got the escape route.

75
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,060
Ah, ahead, right at the traffic signal.

76
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,080
That’s the wrong way!

77
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,460
Shut up!

78
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,540
We went off the route...

79
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,870
Fuck the route!

80
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,430
I'll get us back on track.

81
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,560
Fuji-kun!

82
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,130
Behind us! They are coming!

83
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,860
It's not over!

84
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,440
Yanagi-saaan!

85
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,400
Go on.

86
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,910
Speed it up, now!

87
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,400
Screw it, I don't care anymore!

88
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,300
Now.

89
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,380
Yes.

90
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,620
It's over.

91
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,940
We've got to keep going.

92
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,580
There's blood...

93
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,340
Lay off.

94
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,060
Is that guy dead?

95
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,750
I feel relieved now.

96
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,740
My poor car is covered with scratches...

97
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,600
It's the ultimate sacrifice.

98
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,150
My name is Hiiragi Mana.

99
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,350
What's yours?

100
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,080
Huh?

101
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,010
Don’t you guys know each other?

102
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,180
No.

103
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,800
She just rescued me... from that scary guy.

104
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,730
S-She did?

105
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,390
From Tower's Old Ones?

106
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,040
Why do you know about the Old Ones?

107
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,850
What are you guys doing?

108
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,970
What is Tower?

109
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,070
Who are they?

110
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,980
That's what we want to know...

111
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,180
We are trying to expose the identity of Tower.

112
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,000
Do you have a grudge against them?

113
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,990
What happened back there?

114
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,000
Why was that monster... dead?

115
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,050
Because I killed it.

116
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,910
Who are you?

117
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,570
It's from headquarters?

118
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,740
From Yanagi-san?

119
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:48,000
Kisaragi Saya, don't you wish to shoot Nanahara Fumito?

120
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,340
Fumito...

121
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,560
I am inviting you back to headquarters.

122
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,440
We'll talk... then.

123
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,300
The winner receives a reward...

124
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,730
The loser receives punishment...

125
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,420
Fumito-sama.

126
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,150
The governor of Tokyo is
requesting a lunch meeting

127
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,670
regarding the punishment of all those who violated the Juvenile Protection Curfew Ordinance,

128
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,540
which has been in effect since last month.

129
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,900
If you become the governor of Tokyo soon,

130
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,540
there won't be a need for such wasteful meetings, Yuka-kun.

131
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,110
I agree with you.

132
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,670
How old are you now?

133
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,770
28 years old.

134
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,830
You were only a high-school student six months ago.

135
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,700
You want to forget your bad memories quickly, don't you?

136
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,050
I appreciate that you know how I feel.

137
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,080
Next is the meeting with the Ambassador of the United States.

138
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,740
He wishes to move up the meeting date.

139
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,250
Recent appointments and reports are all like that...

140
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,690
Considering the financial strength and influence of our company, Seventh Heaven,

141
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,740
and the secret you and your family have been protecting,

142
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,850
even this is not enough.

143
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,420
You are ambitious.

144
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,560
Fumito-sama.

145
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,170
What happened, Kuto?

146
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,000
The one that escaped from the laboratory was destroyed.

147
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,200
We have finished recovery from inside of the subway,

148
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,890
but there are two witnesses.

149
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,270
We were outmaneuvered?

150
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,350
I disposed of the ones that let them escape.

151
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,400
Next time, I will handle it personally.

152
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,160
I don't think you'll be able to get them.

153
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,790
Saya's showed up.

154
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,210
We should be going.

155
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,360
What's wrong?

156
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,090
Come here quickly.

157
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,260
Come in.

158
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,770
Hiiragi, I understand the situation.

159
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,720
Y-Yes.

160
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,190
Welcome, Kisaragi Saya. I am Mogari Kuroto.

161
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,980
Why do you know me?

162
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,860
Ukishima.

163
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,620
An experiment took place there that killed all the residents.

164
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:38,010
Brutality is the only word sufficient to describe the manner in which they were killed.

165
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:54,990
However, there was one survivor from that experiment.

166
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,160
It was you. Kisaragi Saya.

167
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,320
Why do you have these?

168
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,870
Itsuki sent these to me.

169
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:18,000
He called himself Tomofusa Itsuki when he was talking to you, didn't he?

170
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,030
He hacked the Tower's surveillance cameras and kept sending us data,

171
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,580
even if it was only bits and pieces.

172
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,660
Is that person...

173
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:33,300
He did not work with us, but he was a member of SIRRUT.

174
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,670
Is Itsuki...?

175
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,780
Dead.

176
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,180
Itsuki participated in the Ukishima experiment in order to expose everything about Tower.

177
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,100
Tower?

178
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,200
An organization that Nanahara Fumito is secretly controlling.

179
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,970
Officially, Fumito is a chairman of Seventh Heaven — a giant conglomerate,

180
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:02,170
not only in Japan, but also in the rest of the world.

181
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,420
He has strong political connections,

182
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:11,360
and is said to have had a part in the new Juvenile Protection Curfew Ordinance.

183
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,530
But the only thing he's interested in is that other organization.

184
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,060
That is Tower?

185
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:28,530
Fumito is trying to accomplish something using the power of both Seventh Heaven and Tower.

186
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,640
Something?

187
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,290
Unfortunately, we do not know exactly what that “something” is.

188
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,710
But we know that many people have been killed because of it.

189
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:46,260
And that things called “Old Ones” are involved.

190
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,620
How do you know all this?

191
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,370
Because I researched, using all my time, money and power.

192
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,680
Why?

193
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:02,690
Because Nanahara Fumito took away my freedom.

194
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,650
And...

195
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,360
The videos that Itsuki had sent were just fragments,

196
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,290
so I only saw bits and pieces of your life in Ukishima,

197
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:24,220
but I could tell you were almost a different person now

198
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,090
and that you were deceived by Fumito.

199
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,840
You came to Tokyo to look for Fumito, didn't you?

200
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,990
For the past six months, you've been coming around here and making trouble each time.

201
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,080
However, none of this was reported in the news.

202
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,160
If they were not reported…

203
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,150
They could not hide them.

204
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,540
In Japan, censorship of the internet is currently very strict,

205
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,370
but we still have two good hackers.

206
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,830
She is one of them — Tsukiyama Hiro-san.

207
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,120
And the other is...

208
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,380
The other is another story, but this is Fujimura Shu-kun.

209
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,400
And the big one here is Matsuo Iori-kun.

210
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,980
That's me.

211
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,690
Mana introduced herself in the car, didn't she?

212
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,010
I am Yanagi Haruno, a secretary of Mogari-san.

213
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:36,160
These are all members of SIRRUT who come to this mansion.

214
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:43,560
There are many others who support us on the internet.

215
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,580
Everyone wants to abolish all the strange regulations and ordinances,

216
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,980
such as the Juvenile Protection Curfew Ordinance and internet censorship.

217
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,050
Where is Fumito now?

218
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:01,230
These days, for his protection,

219
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:06,060
his whereabouts are not being made public.

220
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,730
Do you mean you don't know?

221
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,400
I have ways of finding him.

222
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,480
Members of SIRRUT connected through the network will...

223
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,520
provide you with Fumito’s information.

224
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,880
So, I need you to use your power to assist me, Kisaragi Saya.

225
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,720
Nanahara Fumito is my prey.

226
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,680
Do not forget that.

227
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,080
Is it really okay to bring her into our group?

228
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,020
Thank you.

229
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,710
Here, Tsuki-chan.

230
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,950
Thank you.

231
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,510
What? Are you unsatisfied?

232
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,130
No, it’s not that; I just don't like her attitude.

233
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,510
There's no way we can trust her.

234
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,470
She doesn't talk and she's so full of herself.

235
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,160
But she is so beautiful.

236
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,860
Ah, so you don’t care how she acts as long as she looks good?

237
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,320
Did you forget about how she squeezed your cheeks?

238
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,190
I give up.

239
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,690
It’s Mogari-san’s decision.

240
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,620
I know that. But I still don’t like it.

241
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,480
Tsuki-chan, you agree with me, don’t you?

242
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,070
Tsuki-chan is upset because Mana can’t play with her.

243
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,040
She has to show our new member around.

244
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,510
Fuji-kun, I'm not gonna show you the cute cat video I downloaded yesterday...

245
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,640
Nooooooo!

246
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,650
You'll show it to me, won’t you?!

247
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,640
Don’t bother Fuji.

248
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,310
You are so mean, Matsu-san!

249
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,540
Isn't this a huge mansion?

250
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,600
Mogari-san is also the president of Sysnet, which is the most popular...

251
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,980
company among recent graduates.

252
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,760
Saya is... a beautiful name.

253
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,810
Your last name, Kisaragi, is a very nice name as well.

254
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,260
That is not my name.

255
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,130
But...

256
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,400
Oh, wait.

257
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,600
This is your room.

258
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,450
The bathroom is over there and a change of clothes is…

259
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,480
This is fine.

260
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,720
No, you have to wash them.

261
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,870
I'll ask Yanagi-san for the clothes.

262
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,320
Understood.

263
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:15,420
Everyone else is commuting here from their homes,

264
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,320
but I asked Mogari-san to let me live here.

265
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,340
And my room is next to yours.

266
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,740
So, if , if...

267
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:38,700
if you're having any trouble or you need anything, let me know.

268
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,370
I don’t need anything, but there is a place I want to go.

269
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,570
Why are you following me?

270
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,140
Huh?

271
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,980
Why are you coming with me?

272
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,720
It's dangerous to be alone... well maybe not...

273
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,770
but, well, you don’t have a cell phone,

274
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:38,340
so SIRRUT can't reach you, right?

275
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,180
Do you want to have another encounter like yesterday?

276
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,580
But I want to be with you.

277
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,090
Why?

278
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,420
I don’t know...

279
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:11,370
I didn't know there was a house like this in such a place.

280
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,660
Can you see?

281
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,140
See what? Is there something else?

282
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,560
It’s not a house.

283
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,770
It’s a shop.

284
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,520
Long time no see, Saya.

285
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,480
It’s only been 6 months.

286
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,820
It’s been a while since I've seen the old Saya.

287
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,920
Please.

288
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,130
Thank you very much!

289
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,420
Saya.

290
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,970
I don’t want it.

291
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,520
It’s delicious!

292
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,850
I’m glad.

293
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,420
Umm, what kind of shop this is?

294
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,610
A shop that fulfills your wishes.

295
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,310
Huh?

296
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,780
It’s a variety shop.

297
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,440
Are you a regular patron of this shop?

298
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,760
I've only been here a few times.

299
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,040
There's something I want here.

300
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:28,290
It's a little surprising that Saya brought company.

301
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,930
I just followed her.

302
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,760
She allowed it.

303
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:43,530
At Ukishima, I was able to be near you through him, but I can't say I was of any help.

304
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,670
You brought yourself back on your own.

305
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:51,020
Even so, your words helped me.

306
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,700
Then, what do you want today?

307
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,600
I want a sword... A strong sword.

308
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,810
Amazing, so many..

309
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,500
I expected you would select that one.

310
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,670
What is the price?

311
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,880
You can pay me when you return.

312
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,590
Understood.

313
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,840
Wait.

314
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,230
Will you stay with Saya?

315
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,070
But... I get the feeling that she doesn't want me there...

316
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,490
You are able to enter the shop.

317
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,190
That’s enough.

318
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,290
Well, what's the relationship between you two?

319
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,590
I'm a shop owner and she's my customer, that’s it.

320
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:39,930
But the longer people live, the more they start to care about one another.

321
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,860
Their fates are already bonded.

322
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,620
Wait, Saya!

323
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,950
This is an announcement from Tokyo Metro.

324
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,660
It is now past 8 PM.

325
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,000
In accordance with the Tokyo Juvenile Protection Curfew Ordinance,

326
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,310
anyone under 20 years old is prohibited from going out after 9 PM

327
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:20,640
without being accompanied by their parents or carrying their consent form.

328
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,860
If you are under 20 years old and don't have a consent form, please return home immediately.

329
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,980
This is an announcement from Tokyo Metro.

330
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,560
It is now past 8 PM.

331
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,810
In accordance with the Tokyo Juvenile Protection Curfew Ordinance,

332
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:35,980
anyone under 20 years old is prohibited from going out after 9 PM

333
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,010
Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,170
I figured I'd use my phone... to tell
the others about it...

335
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,400
without being accompanied by their parents or carrying their consent form.

336
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,800
If you are under 20 years old and don't have a consent form,

337
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,250
About what?

338
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,280
please return home immediately...

339
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,910
About that.

340
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,460
That area under surveillance.

341
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,080
There was an announcement just now, wasn't there?

342
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,670
After 9 PM, juveniles like us can't go outside without permission.

343
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:57,210
Sign-armband: Juvenile Protection

344
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,900
Hey, it's time for you to go home.

345
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,560
What?

346
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,210
Okay.

347
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,140
That's why rumors about you started circulating on the internet almost instantly.

348
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:17,610
Afternoon news: Due to business restructuring of Seventh Heaven conglomerate, Mr. Amino Mitsuharu will replace Nanahara Fumito as the Japanese representative. Mr. Amino Mitsuharu is the stepfather of the present governor of Tokyo, Ms. Amino Yuuka, and is the Head of Economic Research...

349
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,910
A mysterious girl roaming around by herself,

350
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,600
despite looking just like a juvenile.

351
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,770
You can't take rumors like that lightly.

352
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:29,040
Information not just about Seventh Heaven,
but also Tower can be found hidden among them.

353
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,000
It's suspected that the current regulations are also aimed at suppressing such rumors.

354
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:38,290
Nowadays, compared to news broadcasts or newspapers, the internet is much faster,

355
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,360
so you can't really hide or fabricate information.

356
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,330
And the people who're most familiar with the internet and have the largest online presence are...

357
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,440
Juveniles, right?

358
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,760
Mogari-san also said that the
censorship is probably intended

359
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,100
to ensure that the children who control the future of Japan

360
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,870
will not question the present government, or Tower.

361
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,980
But why would they go to such lengths to do that?

362
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,910
This person, Nanahara Fumito, is...

363
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,360
S-Sorry!

364
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,080
I've been doing all the talking.

365
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,180
Hey, wait, you two!

366
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,780
Huh?

367
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,390
What's the matter?

368
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,730
It's still only barely past 8 PM...

369
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,580
It's not about the time.

370
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,280
You there,

371
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,620
I'm sorry, but could you show me your identification card?

372
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,480
There's something I want to check—Hey!

373
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,310
Wait!

374
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,300
Stop right there!

375
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,860
Sign-armband: Juvenile Protection

376
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,580
You are—

377
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,360
You little brat!

378
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,830
Number 312, please check in.

379
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,960
Number 312, please check in.

380
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,160
She's really amazing.

381
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,270
What are you doing?!

382
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,020
We need to get out of here!

383
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,560
I told you...

384
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,950
I told you it was dangerous, didn't I?!

385
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,180
I'm sorry!

386
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,690
By any chance, were we exposed, or...?

387
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,860
I don't think so.

388
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,800
They only talked to Saya.

389
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,740
Why only Saya-san?

390
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,580
But the inspectors were all defeated in the blink of an eye.

391
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,760
That's why there's not even a scratch on me.

392
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,200
I'm glad to hear that.

393
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,610
Thanks, Tsuki-chan.

394
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,830
Hiiragi, if that happens again, you should just run away.

395
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,230
Just leave that broad behind.

396
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,370
But she's a beauty...

397
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,230
She's not my type.

398
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,600
Matsu-san's type is Yanagi-san, isn't it?

399
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,120
T-That's not true, you moron!

400
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,590
Really, you should've just left her behind.

401
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:23,000
I figured I'd just be in the way if I stayed...

402
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,480
You couldn't bear to leave her behind?

403
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,420
I... guess so.

404
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,100
Mana-chan, I couldn't really get information about your father...

405
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,180
Sorry.

406
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,390
It's been four months now, right?

407
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,950
I think we should reall—

408
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,110
It'll be fine!

409
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,840
Mana, I'll try hard enough for the both of us!

410
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,650
So, you...

411
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,440
Tsuki-chan...

412
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:06,920
You're right.

413
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,320
Yeah! We're a team!

414
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,410
We'll expose all the evils in this world!

415
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,360
SIRRUT!

416
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,060
We won't let something like this bring us down!

417
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,490
Thanks, everyone.

418
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,470
I see... a katana.

419
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,110
You're going to use that...

420
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,820
...to kill Fumito?

421
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,590
That's right.

422
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:49,010
Mogari-san, carrying firearms or swords within SIRRUT... no, within this building, is...

423
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,590
I think it's okay in this building.

424
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:54,340
Let's just prepare for it, so as not to arouse suspicion.

425
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,230
May I call you "Saya"?

426
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,940
Call me whatever you like.

427
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,660
Well then, Saya, Tower is looking for you.

428
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,760
According to information gathered by Tsukiyama-kun and the others,

429
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,940
Tower is running a circular on you through Seventh Heaven.

430
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:26,530
They've increased the number of inspectors within Tokyo,

431
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,260
and are quietly searching for you.

432
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,580
It'd be great if you could avoid a recurrence of today's incident if possible.

433
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,630
I have no intention of listening to your instructions.

434
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,120
I know that.

435
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,990
However, if you really want to kill Fumito,

436
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,300
wait for your chance.

437
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,000
I'll definitely create one for you,

438
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,390
no matter what I have to do.

439
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,230
What happened between you and that man?

440
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,860
Fumito and I are...

441
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,490
cousins.

442
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,250
Follow me.

443
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,600
Do you know the "Shujikimen"?

444
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,470
Yes.

445
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:22,340
An agreement with aberrations known as Old Ones.

446
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,320
A compact that allows them to feed on humans, but only up to a set number.

447
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,210
And that is the "Shujikimen".

448
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:36,410
Fumito and I were from the clan that

449
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:41,420
hid and protected the "Shujikimen" for generations.

450
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,400
That's right...

451
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,840
we were the descendants of the clan that made the agreement with the Old Ones.

452
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,360
The Mogari family, in the foreground,

453
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,160
will ensure that the controlling governments of each era

454
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,600
follow what's in the agreement.

455
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,000
And the Nanahara family, in the background,

456
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,080
will use the secret powers of Ugetsu to protect the Mogari family.

457
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,580
As a combination of the two, we were called "Tower".

458
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,900
Until Fumito chose to take a different path.

459
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,860
You are the first person I've ever brought here.

460
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:42,570
Six years ago, Fumito came here with an armed military unit.

461
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,460
His objective was the "Shujikimen".

462
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,490
He killed my father, who was the head of the Mogari family, and my mother.

463
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,960
He took everything I had away from me,

464
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,630
right in front of my eyes.

465
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,130
Saya... kill Fumito for me.

466
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:25,100
kill... Fumito for me.

467
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:35,230
I'm searching for Fumito for my own reasons.

468
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,690
I know that.

469
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:44,560
However, you hate him too, don't you?

470
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,420
Oh, welcome back!

471
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,910
...Or not.

472
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,810
Um... I meant to say thanks...

473
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,170
What for?

474
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:46,920
Regarding the inspectors earlier...

475
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,980
I'm the reason you got caught up in that mess, aren't I?

476
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,100
But you still escaped and took me with you.

477
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,120
Thanks—

478
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:03,860
Oh!

479
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,340
Now what?

480
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,010
G-Good night.

481
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,020
I'll talk to her more tomorrow!

482
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,070
At least a minute more...

483
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:43,690
Saya!

484
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:47,670
Saya!

485
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,300
Saya-chan!

486
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,600
Saya!

487
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,580
Saya!

488
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:52,910
Saya-san!

489
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,450
Saya.

490
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,590
Saya!

491
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,520
Saya!

492
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,280
Saya!

493
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:58,800
Saya!

494
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,540
Stop it!

495
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:45,580
Saya,

496
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,810
when you lived in Ukishima, and had forgotten everything, I really liked you...

497
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:55,850
However, what attracted me to you really was....

498
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:56,760
Fumito-sama.

499
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,050
Everything's ready.

500
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,400
I see.

501
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:09,150
We'll meet soon, Saya.

502
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,630
What is this outrageous thing?

503
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,860
When are you gonna start following either Tsuki-chan's or Fuji-kun's example?

504
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:36,550
I'm not techno-savvy in the slightest.

505
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:40,070
I even struggle with e-mail.

506
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:45,940
Even though I'm Mogari-san's secretary, I'll still help you guys out.

507
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:50,990
I'm not a superwoman like you.

508
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,330
You're not being adorable at all.

509
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,700
I'm fine with not being adorable!

510
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,040
I'm just a driver who's got to deal with every single problem around here!

511
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,380
Geez...

512
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:15,570
What's wrong, Mana-chan?

513
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,430
I didn't reach my one-minute goal.

514
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,000
Huh?

515
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,600
You're so lucky that you and Matsuo-kun can be so friendly with each other.

516
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,420
W-What are you talking about?

517
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:33,010
You don't like being friendly?

518
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,630
I-I'm not saying that, am I?

519
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:37,700
I did it!

520
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:39,120
Huh?

521
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,110
Nanahara Fumito's plans!

522
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:44,770
We know about one of them!

523
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:45,730
What?!

524
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:48,970
High school?

525
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:49,740
That's right.

526
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:55,530
This school has been receiving benefits from Seventh Heaven.

527
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:57,780
There'll be many such organizations, won't there?

528
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,360
Not just schools,

529
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,160
but also other charitable organizations like hospitals and orphanages.

530
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,060
There are so many—

531
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,050
Oh those!

532
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:09,250
I divided the work with Tsuki-chan, and we checked every one of them!

533
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,330
And then... Bingo!

534
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:12,390
You mean Tsuki-chan found it, right?

535
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,090
Um, yeah...

536
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,500
Tsuji Private School.

537
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:22,910
Tomorrow, Nanahara Fumito will be giving a lecture there.

538
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,290
You're really something, managing to get your hands on this info.

539
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,500
Regarding that... you see,

540
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,700
we searched for loopholes in the network security...

541
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,400
You mean Tsuki-chan did, right?

542
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:39,380
Is this information reliable?

543
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,260
Besides hacking skills,

544
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,540
I was also taught the importance of determining the reliability of information, so...

545
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,110
What will you do, Saya?

546
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:55,130
I'll go.

547
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,030
Hey wait,

548
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:01,020
isn't it obvious that the school will have some unbelievably tight security?

549
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,440
If you just go like that,

550
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,860
you won't even be able to pass through the gate, much less get near Fumito.

551
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:09,120
Regarding that, I've... I've worked hard on it!

552
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,860
The locations of all the guards are at my fingertips!

553
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,020
Fujimura-kun, you're really something!

554
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,930
What about the uniform?

555
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:20,600
Even if you infiltrate the school under the guise of a student,

556
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,560
it's impossible to get your hands on one,

557
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,310
and even if you wanted to make one, the lecture's tomorrow...

558
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,130
Um...

559
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,100
Huh?

560
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,490
I may be able to help with the uniform.

561
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,410
Huh?

562
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,490
Wait.

563
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,940
It doesn't look like it's going to stop raining.

564
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,540
Wait up, Saya!

565
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,270
The sound is great!

566
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,500
The GPS is working perfectly too!

567
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,500
But I didn't expect Mana-chan to be a student at Tsuji Private School...

568
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:27,450
Hiiragi managed to tell Mogari-san herself that she'd be going.

569
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,620
Please let me go with Saya.

570
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,350
Please!

571
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,500
Saya...

572
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,660
Do as you see fit.

573
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,730
We should give it everything we've got as well.

574
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:49,780
Yeah!

575
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:50,870
You're right.

576
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,760
If they encounter any danger, make sure you rush in to the rescue, got it?

577
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,670
Sure!

578
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,170
I know you're worried,

579
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,330
but let's provide as much support as we can, okay?

580
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:07,660
Yes.

581
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:19,480
You don't look like you're walking around in an unknown school.

582
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,550
I'll stand out more if I'm on my guard.

583
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:24,740
Y-You're right.

584
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,270
Did you know?

585
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:27,980
Huh?

586
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:32,690
That this school has ties with them?

587
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,650
Yes.

588
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,110
A stone monument thanking them for their donations was erected,

589
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:41,010
and the teachers told us about it.

590
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,700
Actually, I wanted to leave this school, but...

591
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,460
Hiiragi-san!

592
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,160
Huh?

593
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,280
You've come.

594
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,790
Y-Yes.

595
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,320
I thought you would be relaxing,

596
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,100
since it's still winter break.

597
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,270
It's troublesome for someone alone like you, isn't it?

598
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:04,770
Are you all right?

599
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:06,100
Y-Yes.

600
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:09,480
There's the matter regarding your father too, so I guess it's inevitable,

601
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,370
but I'm glad that you look well!

602
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:14,290
Ah, it's almost time...

603
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,770
Let's go.

604
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:30,340
I'm glad that we don't have to sit according to our class.

605
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,540
Our school is generally like that.

606
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,290
What were you talking about just now...

607
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:35,110
Huh?

608
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,460
Regarding your father...

609
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,710
Never mind, it's fine.

610
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,920
Everyone, please be quiet.

611
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,450
We'll start our special lecture now.

612
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,660
The speaker will be Mr. Nanahara Fumito.

613
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:55,460
Nanahara... isn't that Seventh Heaven's...

614
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,510
Are you serious?

615
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,880
So that's why we weren't allowed to bring in our mobile phones.

616
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,270
What's going on?

617
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,080
Please calm down.

618
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,970
Please leave the lecture hall, following the instructions we have given.

619
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,860
We should hurry up and leave.

620
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:33,890
Saya!

621
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,730
Mana!

622
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,230
What's happening?

623
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,960
I-I don't know!

624
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,760
After the alarm went off, there were screams!

625
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,120
But the school director's not moving at all!

626
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,540
Saya, it's been a long time, hasn't it?

627
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:04,000
Saya!

628
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,300
Fumito!!!

629
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:27,780
Saya, I'm sorry to disappoint you after you came all the way here.

630
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:34,230
You're strong, so I thought it would be
troublesome if things remained this way.

631
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:39,040
That's why... I'll play around with you a little.

632
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,250
What... am I doing...

633
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,760
Saya!

634
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,560
Saya!

635
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,340
S-Saya!

636
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,670
Mana!

637
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,270
Saya...

638
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,450
Saya!

639
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,790
Saya!

640
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,380
Matsu-san!

641
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,080
What?!

642
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,670
Let's go!

643
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:55,460
Fuji!

644
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,670
Hold on tight!

645
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,660
B-Blood...

646
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,170
Saya.

647
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,960
Mana, let's go!

648
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,140
Sure.

649
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,290
I'll go.

650
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:36,320
The rest of you, hurry up with the collection.

651
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,580
Saya, move aside please.

652
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,190
I'll open it.

653
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:54,500
So you're Saya.

654
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,760
What's the matter?

655
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,300
Does it hurt?

656
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,470
You're a monster, just like that one you killed.

657
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:04,400
Shut up!

658
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:20,190
Saya!

659
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,580
Don't worry about me!

660
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,300
This is the end!

661
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,420
You can't kill humans, right?

662
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,820
Saya!

663
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:51,820
That's why you're unable to protect anyone.

664
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:01,690
Get in!

665
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:03,900
Quickly!

666
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,620
She needs treatment quickly!

667
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,120
She escaped.

668
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,370
Yeah.

669
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,720
The blood collection went exactly as planned.

670
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,390
We'll send it to the lab now.

671
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,570
Thanks for the hard work.

672
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,740
In other words, we were tricked.

673
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,660
I'm sorry.

674
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:56,920
Tsuki-chan...

675
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,650
It's not your fault, Tsuki-chan.

676
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,970
I allowed them to carry out the plan.

677
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,520
It's my responsibility.

678
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:09,780
Mogari-san.

679
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,190
But I'm glad both of them managed to come back safely.

680
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,580
Even though my car got wrecked again.

681
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:21,180
It's an honorable battle scar.

682
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,530
Well, someone did get injured.

683
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:28,430
Compared to that, a little scratch is nothing...

684
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:32,280
Didn't you have something against Saya-san?

685
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,850
She got injured protecting Hiiragi, didn't she?

686
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:39,210
Even though she could've ran away on her own if she had wanted to...

687
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:43,060
I think I'm starting to see her in a new light.

688
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,860
How's Saya-san?

689
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,410
She said she's not going to the hospital,

690
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:50,630
so Hiiragi got angry and ran after her.

691
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:56,330
Wasn't Mana the one who hacked the lock on the lecture hall?

692
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:57,740
I think so.

693
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,560
Mana... cracked the code.

694
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:03,540
Well, one thing led to another.

695
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,480
And within such a short time...

696
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,950
That's so like her.

697
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,900
Now we have another outstanding hacker in our organization.

698
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:12,500
I'm not outstanding at all!

699
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,410
Mana's the amazing one!

700
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,220
I'm just trying to keep up with what she taught me.

701
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,300
She's totally out of my league.

702
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:25,950
Will Mana go back to being a hacker because of this?

703
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,680
No!

704
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:36,020
You mustn't ignore your wounds!

705
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:40,250
You can't possibly be fine after suffering such an injury!

706
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,590
It's really not a big deal.

707
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:43,150
Saya!

708
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,410
I'm really sorry.

709
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,640
You don't have to apologize.

710
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:05,610
But it's...

711
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,680
it's my fault.

712
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,750
I've had enough.

713
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:18,600
I'm really fine.

714
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,440
The wounds have closed up.

715
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,060
Why?

716
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:33,040
Even if you don't know the reason, I'm telling you I'm fine.

717
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:34,870
Do you understand now?

718
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,480
Yeah.

719
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,590
You said you've had enough?

720
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,810
Did you have similar experiences before?

721
01:05:55,160 --> 01:06:00,140
My mother passed away early,
so it's just been me and my father.

722
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:07,690
My father is bad at cooking, but he tried very hard to learn how to cook for me.

723
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:14,480
Even though he was always busy with work, he gave it his all for my sake.

724
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:18,620
You see, my father was a journalist.

725
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:24,800
He loved reading the newspapers from back when articles were still printed on paper

726
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:27,780
and delivered to the reader.

727
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,110
When we met occasionally, he would always say that

728
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,830
journalists needed to be curious and have inquisitive minds.

729
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,770
He said that they have to be knowledgeable about a variety of things,

730
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:41,950
remain unbiased by the information around them,

731
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:45,220
and provide thorough coverage of the news.

732
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,820
I was often reminded that

733
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:52,580
once I made a decision, I should always stick with it to the end.

734
01:06:55,180 --> 01:07:01,160
A year ago, my father targeted Seventh Heaven for his next big scoop.

735
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:04,970
However, he immediately received pressure from his superiors,

736
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:06,850
and the coverage was discontinued.

737
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,340
But that didn't stop my father.

738
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,260
He said he would continue even on his own,

739
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:14,500
and that he would definitely write an article on it.

740
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:21,780
I thought I would be able to help my father, so I did some research.

741
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:28,120
I only did it because I was so confident in my technological skills.

742
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:33,250
I managed to hack into Seventh Heaven's system.

743
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,450
That's when I found out how many people had gone there,

744
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:39,700
and how most of them had disappeared.

745
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:46,950
I also found out about the existence of something named "Tower".

746
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:52,080
After gathering all the evidence, my father went off to meet with Nanahara Fumito.

747
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,750
He... thanked me.

748
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:03,420
And just like that, he was gone forever.

749
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:07,850
If only I hadn't done such a thing!

750
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:14,700
Father... my father didn't come back,

751
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,440
and it's all my fault!

752
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,780
I wanted to search for my father,

753
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:22,760
so I joined this organization.

754
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,570
But I was afraid to find out the truth,

755
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:26,790
so I couldn't focus on hacking.

756
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:31,010
What would I do if I found out that my father was dead?

757
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:44,220
What about your father?

758
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:45,820
I don't have one.

759
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,980
However, I did have someone who was like a father to me.

760
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,480
He was a kind person.

761
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,140
Why are you so strong?

762
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,890
I'm like your father.

763
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:07,700
Huh?

764
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:13,440
I make my own decisions,
and see them through to the very end.

765
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:15,330
I had to find my resolve,

766
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,200
so I could remain true to myself.

767
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:23,770
I finally understand...

768
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:28,140
why I couldn't leave you alone.

769
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,160
We're pretty similar, aren't we?

770
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,870
We're both lonely.

771
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,940
Just as I thought, there's nothing written anywhere

772
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:51,610
about that incident yesterday at Tsuji Private School.

773
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,120
Geez... damn it!

774
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,020
Mana-san and Saya-san didn't come, did they?

775
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:01,010
She suffered so many injuries.

776
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:03,690
Mana-chan's probably taking care of her.

777
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,490
Actually, she really should go to the hospital.

778
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:10,180
Good morning.

779
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,840
Morning!

780
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,740
Hey, you're lat—

781
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:14,890
Sorry.

782
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,960
I stayed up late last night.

783
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:21,640
Tsuki-chan, good morning.

784
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:27,070
Mana!

785
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:34,780
Sorry for giving you bad information.

786
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,240
You didn't lie to us on purpose, right?

787
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,640
I would never do such... a thing!

788
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,260
Then it's fine.

789
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:46,650
As long as you weren't lying, it's okay.

790
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:53,310
Does it hurt?

791
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,720
No.

792
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:55,920
Really?

793
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,670
Yeah.

794
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,250
I hope you recover from your injuries soon.

795
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,610
Um, what am I saying?

796
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:12,670
It seems that I was somewhat mistaken about you.

797
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:15,700
Why do you sound so arrogant when you're supposed to be apologizing?

798
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:16,960
Shut up!

799
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,660
Anyway, thank you for protecting Hiiragi!

800
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:29,440
Wha— are you ignoring me?!

801
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,860
Now, now.

802
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,930
Everyone, I've got something to tell you.

803
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,140
Hacking?

804
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:40,380
Yes.

805
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:43,610
Mana-san, are you sure?

806
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,410
I'm sure.

807
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,840
I've realized that I need to stop running away and face my problems,

808
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,620
no matter what the outcome will be.

809
01:11:57,490 --> 01:12:00,760
Hiiragi... I understand.

810
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:06,970
After that incident at Tsuji Private School, it's very likely that Tower—

811
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:11,030
or rather, Fumito will make a serious move to crush us.

812
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:13,820
We should decide whether we need to fortify our defenses first,

813
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,740
or head straight for the enemy headquarters.

814
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:19,310
I would like everyone to consider these options.

815
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,300
Yes, sir!

816
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:40,290
It seems that you have a tendency to capture the hearts of those you encounter.

817
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,190
I've done nothing.

818
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:56,720
"Ask, and it shall be given;

819
01:12:57,330 --> 01:13:00,420
seek, and ye shall find;

820
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:03,620
knock, and it shall be opened unto you."

821
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:08,010
Man will find answers on his own.

822
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:13,450
Saya, have you found your answer?

823
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,500
Hm?

824
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:17,860
Oh!

825
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,330
Saya, you made this for me?

826
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,950
I only poured what was already made.

827
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,610
Thanks.

828
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,590
Would you like to join me?

829
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:31,660
I—

830
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:34,350
Mogari-san made this for me.

831
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:37,780
Everyone's been grateful to me
because I've been trying so hard.

832
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,950
They said they wanted you to have some as well.

833
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,800
Shouldn't you be sleeping?

834
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,490
When I think I'm about to make a breakthrough, I just can't get to sleep.

835
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:04,400
Besides, just like how you have your abilities, I have mine.

836
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,050
I see.

837
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,390
W-What's the matter?!

838
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,660
I've found it!

839
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:42,430
Tower's headquarters!

840
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:53,110
Tokyo Bay Coastal Breakwater Landfill?

841
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:54,440
Huh?

842
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:58,400
She was really amazing.

843
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,300
It didn't matter what security programs they were running—she was shredding them like paper.

844
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,940
Why didn't you wake me up so I could witness the breakthrough?

845
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,750
But there's nothing there.

846
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,470
You can't find it in a residential search,

847
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:17,210
but you can see it in an aerial view of the area.

848
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:23,260
What?

849
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,430
There's nothing.

850
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:30,480
The satellite view had a fake photo embedded in it.

851
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,950
Now let me remove it.

852
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,140
Ah!

853
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,980
Amazing.

854
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:38,850
You really did a great job.

855
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:44,830
Saya, we might find Fumito there.

856
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:04,970
Damn, it's amazing how they were able to hide such a large facility.

857
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:09,930
We're also amazing since we found it, right?

858
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,400
Sure.

859
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:17,000
Won't you let me go with you?

860
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,020
No.

861
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:21,020
They're armed.

862
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:23,100
This is not your battle.

863
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,960
But Saya, you'll be…

864
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,520
You saw me. Minor injuries are nothing.

865
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:33,790
Also, you've got more important things to worry about.

866
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:40,300
You're right. I have to find my father.

867
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:49,520
We'll do our best to support you.

868
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,060
Are Tsuki-chan and Yanagi-san ready?

869
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,790
We're ready and standing by.

870
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:01,360
Tell us if something goes wrong.

871
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,760
We'll try to stay put for as long as possible.

872
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,390
If you think you can’t go on, just come back.

873
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:09,520
Thank you.

874
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,490
Okay. Let’s move.

875
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:05,370
Where is the target?

876
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,520
It started.

877
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:23,150
Fuji-kun, please secure our communication line.

878
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:24,410
Okay.

879
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:33,950
Tsuki-chan, are you able to infiltrate their communications network?

880
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,860
I've got their wireless communications.

881
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,530
Can you tell how many people there are?

882
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:39,290
Yes.

883
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,570
Saya, I've got the number of people and their locations.

884
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:11,110
The higher up you go, the more resistance you'll encounter.

885
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:13,570
Nanahara Fumito must be on the top floor.

886
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:16,090
No.

887
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:16,810
Eh?

888
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:23,290
Fumito's got something stronger than any human, and it doesn't need wireless communications.

889
01:20:23,290 --> 01:20:24,540
The Old Ones.

890
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:28,710
What's the path of least resistance?

891
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:31,130
The basement.

892
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:32,480
Where is the entrance?

893
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,320
Wait.

894
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:53,820
Are you Fumito’s proxy?

895
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,560
Saya?

896
01:20:59,080 --> 01:20:59,930
Continue.

897
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:01,440
Right.

898
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:10,460
You will not reach Fumito-sama.

899
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:24,500
You look miserable, Kisaragi Saya.

900
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,740
Don't say... that name.

901
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:42,120
I've found the route to get to the basement.

902
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,860
Go to the elevator hall all the way back,

903
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:46,330
and take the right door.

904
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:47,790
Saya?

905
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:52,130
Kuto, it is not necessary any more.

906
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:00,140
Yes, Fumito-sama.

907
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:07,740
Look, this is what a person who would control the world can do.

908
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:54,460
What is that sound?

909
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:55,990
What the hell is going on?

910
01:22:55,990 --> 01:22:58,350
Saya, run straight.

911
01:22:58,350 --> 01:22:59,700
Hurry, Saya.

912
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:18,590
Saya, next, turn left.

913
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,670
You can go down all the way to the bottom from there.

914
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:48,670
Saya.

915
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:50,710
I'm fine. Don't worry.

916
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:41,260
Good evening, Saya.

917
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:47,060
This is…

918
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,940
what the hell... is this?

919
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:57,230
Stop.

920
01:24:58,530 --> 01:24:59,770
Stop!

921
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,480
Saya, Saya! What’s wrong?

922
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,570
Saya!

923
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,740
Fumi...

924
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,700
Saya! Saya!

925
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:11,540
Fuji.

926
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:14,500
I can’t do anything, the line's dead.

927
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:22,810
I disabled the wireless communications because
I didn't want anyone to disturb us,

928
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:26,010
now that we've finally gotten to meet face to face.

929
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:27,300
I’m sorry.

930
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:30,970
I'm really happy that you came to see me,

931
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:35,270
but you shouldn't be causing so much damage.

932
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:51,250
It's finally working, Kuroto.

933
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:55,210
I gave her the amount that I was instructed.

934
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:58,970
Has it just started working after moving around that much?

935
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:00,250
What's with her?

936
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:13,600
That cup of coffee...

937
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:21,240
Why did I have to give her such a thing?

938
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:27,640
All the kids at your place are nice kids with a strong sense of justice.

939
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:31,550
They would never agree to drug her, would they?

940
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:38,080
It doesn't work on humans, only you, Saya.

941
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:41,550
Are you worried about the members of SIRRUT?

942
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:43,390
You've become quite friendly with them,

943
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,720
and that helped lure you here.

944
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:50,430
You even drank the coffee, even though you were so cautious...

945
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:53,310
and never ate anything offered to you before.

946
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,730
They were quite useful.

947
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,360
Don’t misunderstand.

948
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:04,140
I did not deceive them, I used them.

949
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:10,570
At first, SIRRUT was a very small internet group

950
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:14,290
that wanted more freedom here in Japan, more specifically, in Tokyo.

951
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:18,440
Well, I could've left them alone,

952
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:22,480
but you never know how big things will get on the internet.

953
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:27,620
That's why I offered to become their sponsor and provided funds.

954
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:34,350
It made things easier since those brats believed any information I leaked.

955
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:37,560
What's better, you came along,

956
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,120
and they were able to lure you to the mansion.

957
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:48,610
I didn't think Hiiragi would actually find this place.

958
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:53,530
Well, I contacted Fumito right away.

959
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:57,070
Now then, what are you going to do?

960
01:27:57,530 --> 01:28:01,980
Why are you spending so much time and money on one woman like this?

961
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:05,920
Saya is special.

962
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:11,210
Using so much of Seventh Heaven's money, and Tower's strength?

963
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:12,890
Yes.

964
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,260
You said you would dominate the world with your personal connections and power,

965
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:23,730
along with controlling Tower by killing off both of our families.

966
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:25,780
Yes, I did say that.

967
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:30,530
We can expect even more money, power and fame ahead.

968
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:32,610
I don’t need any of that.

969
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:36,660
I said I wanted to have the world.

970
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,620
That’s why bigger thinking…

971
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:42,600
The world is small.

972
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:47,130
It really is very small. Isn't it, Saya?

973
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:50,740
This woman is the one?

974
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,950
You've become careless, Fumito.

975
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:05,810
Disappear here with this monster.

976
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:09,370
I'll make it look like you were killed by this monster.

977
01:29:09,370 --> 01:29:11,740
Then I'll take everything.

978
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:15,620
You underestimate me, cousin.

979
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,170
You were always like that.

980
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:21,660
Always looking down on me,

981
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:22,960
that gaze enrages me!

982
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:34,760
Fumito!

983
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:39,860
I will keep the promise I made to you.

984
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:42,780
Is this...

985
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:46,640
Saya’s blood.

986
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,550
Look, he's joined the covenant.

987
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:05,180
Kuroto, you should now feel the power that you have been longing for.

988
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:15,520
Saya, the key to controlling the man-eating Old Ones

989
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:20,760
has been inherited and carried by the head of the Mogari family.

990
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:27,590
Your blood is the only thing that can sever the ties between humans and the Old Ones.

991
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,680
Curse you, I'll...

992
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,680
Fumito...

993
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:48,340
Saya, one cannot become human; one must be born human.

994
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,030
You cannot kill humans.

995
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:53,510
You are not human.

996
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:59,370
The only thing that can satisfy your hunger is your own kind,

997
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:01,370
the Old Ones.

998
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:03,720
Did you know that...

999
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:10,130
the human population is growing as rapidly as the Old Ones are disappearing?

1000
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:13,390
Soon, there may be no need for the covenant.

1001
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:18,720
Saya, how old are you now?

1002
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,860
How many more years,

1003
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:23,910
rather, how many more hundreds of years will you live?

1004
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:27,120
During that time, the Old Ones may become extinct.

1005
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:31,300
How will you survive if that happens?

1006
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:33,880
Your blood.

1007
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:39,470
I tried to use Tower's magic to create the Old Ones from humans,

1008
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:41,980
but so far, I have not succeeded.

1009
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:44,200
They die quickly.

1010
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:51,200
I am doing my best... to gather people and missing persons.

1011
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,700
Was it Mana-chan?

1012
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:01,280
I saw the video from Mogari mansion.

1013
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,300
Her father was a reporter, wasn't he?

1014
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:09,080
He lived a little bit longer,

1015
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:14,060
but he escaped and died the other day.

1016
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:25,780
You sliced him to death right after you arrived in Tokyo, right, Saya?

1017
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,040
What's going on?

1018
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:04,500
You are truly beautiful, Saya.

1019
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,590
The winner receives a reward.

1020
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:13,240
This is the strongest power that I could create.

1021
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:26,480
Previously, I could only run, but now look.

1022
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,560
The Old Ones.

1023
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,720
Those eyes.

1024
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:13,900
They are the same as when I shot you.

1025
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:17,150
They are so beautiful.

1026
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:19,440
I want you, Saya.

1027
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,060
Fumito!

1028
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:29,470
Fumito.

1029
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:34,240
Why are you doing this?

1030
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,190
Here, Saya.

1031
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:46,660
Fumito...

1032
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:50,730
I told you, it's hard.

1033
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:55,140
I tried it on myself right away.

1034
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,910
If I could be the same thing that you are...

1035
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:07,860
I could finally hold you.

1036
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:11,550
I am sorry, Saya.

1037
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:13,640
If I were a human,

1038
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:18,300
your curse... would be broken.

1039
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:26,060
As a winner, you receive a reward.

1040
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:29,680
As a loser, I receive punishment.

1041
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:39,440
You should have avoided me, Saya,

1042
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,640
you turned it into a reward now...

1043
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,760
I...

1044
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:02,060
I ended up...

1045
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,000
alone...

1046
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:22,110
No way.

1047
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:23,620
It's surrounded by police.

1048
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:28,080
The area is off-limits, except to emergency vehicles.

1049
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:33,420
We can’t get in touch with Mogari-san at all.

1050
01:38:34,150 --> 01:38:37,640
E-Excuse me, excuse me.

1051
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:59,320
Yes, it is necessary to give young people freedom

1052
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:01,240
in order to nurture them.

1053
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:05,670
If you threaten them with harsh restrictions, only resistance will come out of it.

1054
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:09,420
And it is imperative that adults do not deceive children...

1055
01:39:10,490 --> 01:39:13,920
Tsuki-chan, how were classes?

1056
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,010
Mm-hm.

1057
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:16,770
I stayed until the end.

1058
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:19,080
Why don’t you join a club?

1059
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,040
Clubs are boring.

1060
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,740
It’s more fun playing with you guys.

1061
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:26,040
Mana!

1062
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:29,150
Hey!

1063
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:36,760
Once she became the governor,
the internet restrictions were lifted.

1064
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,370
The Juvenile Protection Curfew Ordinance was abolished as well.

1065
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:43,360
It's like heaven compared to how it was back then.

1066
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:49,820
Mogari-san... has disappeared, hasn’t he?

1067
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,400
Sysnet was taken over by other companies,

1068
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:58,980
and all of Seventh Heaven's executives have been replaced.

1069
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:02,250
Nanahara Fumito has completely disappeared;

1070
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:05,850
even the info about him on the internet is gone.

1071
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:10,840
I am sorry for bringing up such a depressing topic.

1072
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:19,100
Well, it has been almost a year and a half since that day.

1073
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:21,660
But...

1074
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,260
But?

1075
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:25,660
That is Matsuo-kun’s fault.

1076
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,490
No, it isn't!

1077
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:28,810
You are not sweet!

1078
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:30,560
Yes, I am!

1079
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,200
They're fighting again...

1080
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:34,570
You are not sweet at all!

1081
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:36,660
Aren't they supposed to be getting married next month?

1082
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:35,740
What do you mean?

1083
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:38,440
Because you're clueless about stuff like this.

1084
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:40,440
They haven't changed, Matsu-san and Yanagi-san.

1085
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,210
What?

1086
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:44,310
Hey there, don’t fight.

1087
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:46,730
Well, of course you're the sweet one.

1088
01:40:46,730 --> 01:40:49,430
What? What are you talking about, don't say such nonsense!

1089
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:51,770
Who's the sweet one...?

1090
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:52,480
What?

1091
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:58,270
But I believe I will see her again.
