"MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM THUNDERBOLT- Episode 1 (2015)" 
^ (Run time : 00:18:24)

2
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:30,203
MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM
THUNDERBOLT

3
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,849
This is a nice song selection.

4
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:37,551
Io, pirate radio again?

5
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:39,631
At least use headphones.

6
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:41,895
You've got to feel the sound.

7
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,710
The previous broadcast?

8
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,050
This one's good.

9
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,935
Yeah, you got it at a good timing.

10
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,275
Maybe the lightning brings it.

11
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,855
- The Minovsky...
- It's light?

12
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,670
Don't care.

13
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,145
- Copy it for me.
- Right here.

14
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,000
This part is great
just before we sortie.

15
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,538
I know what you mean.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,550
I can see it.

17
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,756
Flying and barely dodging the debris.

18
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:11,089
The vibration on my butt.

19
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,550
I feel the switches at my fingertips.

20
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,467
They all become my eyes and move.

21
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,439
Can't they improve the air
in the hangar?

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,939
It's just your sinuses.

23
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,599
Cornelius, tissues.

24
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,200
Give them back, alright?

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,620
- Thanks.
- See you.

26
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,269
Here's the operational objective.

27
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,160
Eliminate the enemy snipers
hiding in our home, Side 4 "Moore".

28
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,829
We've lost over 40 allied
machines this past month.

29
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,189
This Thunderbolt Sector...

30
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,079
We can't forgive the cowards
who destroyed our home.

31
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,149
This war is entering its final stage.

32
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,080
Regaining this sector will
change the tide of the war.

33
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,785
Glory again to Side 4, Moore.

34
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,479
Death to the cowardly Zeon.

35
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,439
The Brotherhood, eh.

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,061
Geez. My birthplace
keeps on tying me down.

37
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,864
Free jazz is perfect for Thunderbolt.

38
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,387
I love mobile suits, space, 
and the battlefield.

39
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:53,276
 It's free here.

40
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,939
Oh no, our positions are obvious.

41
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,519
When they shoot, we'll
trace back their location.

42
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:13,680
Now, who'll be the unlucky one?

43
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,100
- Who's hit?
- Ensign Io.

44
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,345
Commander... Commander!

45
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,659
Emergency.
Emergency.

46
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,579
Commander hit by beam cannon.
His machine's demolished.

47
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,539
They're sniping from the debris.

48
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,949
Radio won't work with this
Minovsky particle density.

49
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,709
You search, too--

50
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,678
Dave!

51
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,015
Find the enemy sniper!

52
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,329
How can they see us?

53
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,619
The Minovsky particles
are still so dense!

54
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,158
Calculate their positions!

55
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:57,863
- It's Side 4!
- Attack our home?

56
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,369
My barrel's past its limit.

57
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,235
Daryl will now be sending
orbit prediction data.

58
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,860
Nice, Chief Petty Officer Daryl.
I got the rest.

59
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:32,989
This'll earn me the Cross.

60
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,759
Bragging to your lady? Or...

61
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,549
Sean, it's complicated
who Ensign Hoover reports to.

62
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,799
Shut up. I'm gonna get them.

63
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,999
Both the Federation and the girl!

64
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,429
Amazing! 
Is Daryl a clairvoyant?

65
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,639
Or one of those Newtypes?

66
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,280
I'll get commended back home.
Then it's vacation!

67
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,799
Ensign Hoover,
is your machine drifting?

68
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,673
Communication's cutting out.
Please check cable connection.

69
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:16,135
Huh?
Really?

70
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:22,273
Huh?

71
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,655
Hey!

72
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,574
Hoover!

73
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,599
It's a human.
A Federation normal suit!

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,009
Daryl, can you snipe him?
I can't aim from here!

75
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,639
But Hoover is--

76
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,780
He's been shot in the head! 
You saw it!

77
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,714
So the cockpit isn't
that different from Zaku.

78
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,549
Hey, you may be aces of the 
snipers division,

79
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,700
but your taste in music
is mediocre.

80
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,969
Big talk for a guy who got lucky.

81
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,986
No wonder a guy with fake legs
sneakily shoots from far away.

82
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,549
Making fun of my legs?

83
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,179
Now I know your firing location.

84
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,759
I'll cruise home via your blind spots.

85
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,849
You won't escape next time.

86
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,179
I'll get you for sure.

87
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,639
I'm Chief Petty Officer Daryl Lorenz.

88
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,219
I'll keep my eye on you.

89
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,830
I'm Ensign Io Fleming.

90
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:35,516
When you hear jazz,
it means I'm coming.

91
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,739
Patti Page, right? "Tennessee Waltz".

92
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,279
You heard?

93
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,199
I like the Royal Teens.

94
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,600
"Short Shorts"?

95
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,109
Ha ha.
No, this.

96
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,239
I see.

97
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,758
If you're interested, okay?

98
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:33,502
We'll see.

99
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,269
24 sortied, and this
is all that's left?

100
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,028
That's a loser's operation for you.

101
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,350
To the maintenance hangar.
Top priority!

102
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,466
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

103
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:10,385
Io!

104
00:09:15,148 --> 00:09:18,772
Ensign Io Fleming, reporting in.

105
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,773
Never did like the guy...

106
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:34,168
Acting like a playboy.

107
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,419
Take the body to the Reuse Lab.

108
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,299
I miraculously found it.
I want to send him to his family.

109
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,589
Get the data from his arm first.

110
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,749
A guinea pig even in death?

111
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,839
It's because of that data
that you can fight, right?

112
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,979
Professor Karla, the body is...

113
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:56,753
Professor?

114
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,799
Major damage, 4.
Minor damage, 6.

115
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,629
Cockpit block only, 5.
Lost, 9.

116
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,270
I see.

117
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,375
We're now gathering data from 
the Rick Dom seized by Ensign Io.

118
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,809
We may get their deployment
and movement patterns.

119
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,849
I see.

120
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,149
We're also loading that item
into the container.

121
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,229
The mechanics we dispatched
have returned along with it,

122
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,769
so they can test it immediately.

123
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,479
Who'll use it?

124
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,939
Who else but Ensign Io?

125
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,519
You're right...

126
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,786
Shall I give the order?

127
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:54,751
No, I'll tell him.

128
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,149
A prototype mobile suit.

129
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,495
The Moore Brotherhood
paid the Federation?

130
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,099
Everyone who outranked you
died in the last operation.

131
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,149
Otherwise...

132
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:25,099
I guess we've both advanced
because our superiors died.

133
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,361
Right, Acting Captain?

134
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,686
Unhand me, Ensign Io Fleming.
Captain's orders.

135
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,867
Yes, sir.

136
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,769
I see.

137
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,928
A surprise, right?

138
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,836
Where's the captain?

139
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:58,995
Quality time with her man.

140
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,345
A captain because she's an elite.
What a privileged class.

141
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,119
I heard Io's getting the prototype.

142
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,119
He's the son of Moore's leader, too.

143
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,199
The incompetent elite let Zeon 
invade and destroy our home.

144
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,039
But they're perfect
as human sacrifices.

145
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,659
The young heroes
who die for their ideals.

146
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,668
Those with sinful lineages can be
Moore Brotherhood propaganda.

147
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:30,608
That's what the Gundam's for.

148
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,390
I won't love you anymore.

149
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,999
Then I can order you to go and die.

150
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,409
That's right, Claudia.
Give me an order to sortie.

151
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,369
I'm captivated...

152
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,161
by these demon mobile suits
that glitter in battle.

153
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,515
I heard the mid-combat
communication records.

154
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,909
The Federation pilot
who killed Hoover...

155
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,449
When you hear jazz,
that means he's coming, right?

156
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,010
Yeah.

157
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,299
Please, Daryl.

158
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,220
You must kill him.

159
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,720
An ace like you
can do that, right?

160
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,885
Professor Karla,
can I get some painkillers?

161
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,586
The legs you gave me...

162
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,896
they hurt really bad tonight.

163
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,435
Confirm the sniper rotation
we got from the Rick Dom.

164
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,965
You got that? Just do it as
an extension of a test flight.

165
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,349
Cornelius, tissues.

166
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,799
Here you go.

167
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,969
Some music too, partner.

168
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,360
Okay.

169
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,969
Amazing.

170
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,139
It's beyond comparison.

171
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,113
This is... Gundam.

172
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,836
This is the best!

173
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:48,127
This is the power I've wanted!

174
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,199
Gundam...

175
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,049
Become my power.

176
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:05,489
It dodged?

177
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,050
No way!

178
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,912
Darn it. 
What's going on?

179
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:38,739
It's jazz.

180
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,109
3 Zakus shot down.

181
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,464
All the Big Gun attacks were dodged.

182
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:47,739
A high-mobility mobile suit
with heavy armor.

183
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:53,774
This machine is a troubling enemy
for our Living Dead Division.

184
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,699
The Federation's...

185
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,380
Gundam.

186
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,204
It's him.

187
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:15,667
