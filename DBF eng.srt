1
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:07,086
--Hey. pouty-pants!
--Pouty-pants! Pouty-pants!

2
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:15,970
Sorbet-sama...

3
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:16,846
What is it?

4
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:20,850
Planet 448, sir.
The native uprising has gotten worse,

5
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:22,769
and the situation is becoming untenable.

6
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,813
Increase the number of soldiers.

7
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,524
The trouble is, with all
the fighting on other worlds,

8
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:29,526
we can only send a few more soldiers.

9
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,277
What?

10
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:36,533
Damn. Disengage. Disengage!

11
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:52,590
This is Sorbet. Tell me,
have you found the planet

12
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,968
with the remaining surviving Namekians yet?

13
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,928
I am terribly sorry, Sorbet-sama.

14
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,097
We are using a large number of spy cameras,

15
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:02,100
but as before, we have
been unable to locate them.

16
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:05,520
Tch! Then there's no other
choice but to go to earth.

17
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:09,065
Earth? But that's dangerous, isn't it?

18
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:11,234
The woman who is said to be
able to search for Dragon Balls

19
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,862
is in league with that Super Saiyan!

20
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,741
If we can't find the Namekians,
we have no choice but to go to earth.

21
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,036
Besides, according to the
data the spy cameras scouted out,

22
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:26,082
the woman isn't the only one
who can find the Dragon Balls.

23
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:30,587
I know the data showed that there was one other.

24
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:35,550
Tagoma! The two of us are going to earth!

25
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:38,469
Yes, sir. But only the two of us are going?

26
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:39,929
Hmph

27
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:43,141
The earth Saiyans seem to have the ability

28
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,020
to detect substantial battle
powers without using a Scouter.

29
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,856
If we go in larger numbers,
there is a risk of us being noticed.

30
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,567
I see. Understood.

31
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:55,695
Sorbet-sama, you're going personally?

32
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,113
Of course.

33
00:03:57,322 --> 00:04:00,033
Freeza-sama is coming back to life!

34
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,466
Sorbet-sama, I've found them! There they are!

35
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:17,550
What?

36
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,844
They already have a number of them gathered.

37
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:20,929
All right, hurry!

38
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:24,349
We have to catch them before
they find them all, no matter what!

39
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:26,100
Yes, sir!

40
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:32,065
Well? The last one is here, right?

41
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:35,777
Y-Yes, it should be directly below us,

42
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,612
but this is trouble.

43
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,449
The sea floor here, of all places,
is considerably deep.

44
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:44,243
Tagoma, dive in and retrieve it.

45
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:45,995
Yes, sir.

46
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,710
Excuse us just a moment...

47
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:59,425
Mai, it's because you couldn't find
them quickly with the Dragon Radar

48
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:03,680
that those crazy aliens are going
to snatch them from us, you know!

49
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:06,265
<i>Pilaf-sama, you should turn them down flat!</i>

50
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:10,561
At this point, you take your gun,
and Shou, you use your katana, and...

51
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,939
Pow-pow-pow-pow! Take care of them!

52
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:16,067
Huh? Pilaf-sama, aren't you going to fight?

53
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:19,904
I'm supposed to be the brains here,
but what choice is there?

54
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:21,531
Let's do it!

55
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,002
Just because I'm small,
you shouldn't take me too lightly.

56
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,171
--We're not taking you lightly!
--We're terribly sorry for this!

57
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:59,819
I'm sorry we're getting back a little late.

58
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:00,862
Huh?

59
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,198
Pan-chan, sorry we're so late.

60
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:07,785
Uncle Piccolo sure is nice,
even for someone green, huh?

61
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,454
Hmph! Hmm?

62
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:12,832
Huh? What's the matter?

63
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,710
I'm sensing an unpleasant Ki in that direction.

64
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,047
Eh? Ah, now that you mention it...

65
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,506
What could it be?

66
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:21,924
I don't know.

67
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:26,471
Ah, there, there. I'm sorry.
We're late, aren't we?

68
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,438
Okay, get started.

69
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:40,109
Y-You're not going to kill us or
anything once we're done, right?

70
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:46,282
Don't worry. It's possible that
we may still have a use for you later.

71
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,910
What, you doubt me?

72
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:51,162
No, not at all.

73
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,833
I-I have a boyfriend named Trunks!

74
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,419
Get started already!

75
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,843
C-Come forth, Shen Long! And grant me my wish!

76
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,774
It just got dark. It couldn't be...

77
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,318
Shen Long? But where?

78
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:33,746
Now, speak thy wish.
I shall grant thee any wish.

79
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:36,124
G-Go ahead.

80
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:40,044
<i>Sorbet-sama, quickly!</i>

81
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:42,130
A-All right.

82
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:45,216
Okay, here goes.

83
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:48,928
Bring Freeza-sama back to life!

84
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:16,914
Wh-What's the matter?
You will grant any wish, right?

85
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:20,001
Of course, it is possible.

86
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:24,213
However, that being's body
was cut to pieces long ago,

87
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,507
and cannot be regenerated.

88
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:30,386
There is little point in
bringing his soul back like this.

89
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,889
Freeza!

90
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:44,317
I-Is that right?

91
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,360
That would be bad, huh?

92
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,779
Sorbet-sama, even dismembered,

93
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:52,408
with the latest regeneration
machine our forces now use,

94
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,702
it may be possible to restore him.

95
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:58,080
Oh yeah! You're right. Okay!

96
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:02,418
Hey! It doesn't matter if he's in pieces.
Bring him back to life now!

97
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:06,964
You certainly are bossy.

98
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:11,761
B-Bring Freeza-sama back to life... please.

99
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:15,306
What's the use? Very well.

100
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:39,247
Now then, speak thy next wish.

101
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:43,417
What? Next wish? You can grant two?

102
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:49,548
Yes. When earth's Kami changed,
I was also renewed.

103
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:52,760
Two... Two, huh?

104
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:58,975
Maybe I should bring
Papa Freeza-sama back, as well.

105
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:02,311
I want 1,000,000 zeni!

106
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,988
Thy wish has been granted.

107
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,657
And now, farewell.

108
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,581
Wh-Why that little punk!

109
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,958
<i>Sorbet-sama,</i>

110
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:28,129
we must hurry. The Saiyans may be coming.

111
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:34,593
Okay, let me go! I know we have
a cryopreservation device packed!

112
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:35,845
Go and get it at once!

113
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,555
Yes, sir!

114
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,520
This is Freeza-sama we're talking about.

115
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:47,189
With his life force and our technology,

116
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:49,984
we can definitely bring him back!

117
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,449
Um, excuse me...

118
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,743
You forgot something.

119
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,370
Here you go.

120
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:08,461
Good job. I will be back here again shortly.

121
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,256
This time with Freeza-sama, and my soldiers.

122
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:26,312
Nice going, Shou.

123
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,898
As long as you were asking,
you could have made it a huge fortune,

124
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,484
like a hundred million zeni.

125
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,277
I was just thinking that with that much money,

126
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:37,198
we could eat very well for a while.

127
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,910
I get it! All right, let's go
get some Mongolian barbecue!

128
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:45,748
--With pudding! With pudding, too!
--Yay! Good food! Good food!

129
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:49,085
It's gone. I wonder what that was.

130
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,545
I have a bad feeling about this.

131
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,245
W-Welcome home, Freeza-sama.

132
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,747
Hmm? Who are you?

133
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:14,628
I-I am Sorbet. I was on your
staff before, in the 3rd Stellar Region.

134
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,965
Ah, you do look a little familiar.

135
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:22,553
Presently, I am leading our
forces in your place, Freeza-sama.

136
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,722
<i>You are?</i>

137
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,728
Apparently, I really have come back to life.

138
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:34,899
Yes, sir, using the Dragon Balls
and our new regenerative machine.

139
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:40,196
Dragon Balls? Ah, those mysterious
orbs the Namekians possess?

140
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:45,618
We could not find the Namekians,
so Tagoma and I went to earth,

141
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,620
and used the Balls that are there.

142
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:53,083
I am Tagoma. I assisted
in your revival, Freeza-sama.

143
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,836
I am Sisami, sir.

144
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:56,754
They are outstanding warriors,

145
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:02,092
rivaling even the now late
Zarbon-sama and Dodoria-sama.

146
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:05,429
Hmm. Well done, men.

147
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:11,435
Incidentally, it took a great deal
of time for you to revive me, yes?

148
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,979
I-I am terribly sorry.

149
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,106
Between the Dragon Balls
and the regenerative machine,

150
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:19,443
there were many preparations
that needed to be made.

151
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:25,241
The suffering was quite terrible,
there in earth's Hell.

152
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,077
We are glad that you are back.

153
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:32,873
Hmph. I will wager that things
did not go well without me being here,

154
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,501
which is why you decided
to revive me, is it not?

155
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,339
N-No, sir, not at all. However,
while time may have passed,

156
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:43,050
that has allowed us to develop
our new regenerative machine,

157
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:46,845
permitting you to return
completely to your previous form.

158
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,013
And Papa?

159
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:51,350
We thought that we would
revive you alone, Freeza-sama,

160
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,060
and your father the next time around.

161
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:57,273
Hmph. You do not have to revive Papa.

162
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,525
He is always so high-and-mighty
about everything, after all.

163
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:03,988
Huh? Y-Yes, sir. As you wish.

164
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:15,708
Sure enough, it appears
that my skills are a bit rusty.

165
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,503
It may require some time
before I am able to take my revenge.

166
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,880
R-Revenge, sir?

167
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:27,177
But of course. I will not
be content until I eliminate

168
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:31,932
the two Super Saiyans
who put me through all of this.

169
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:37,062
Forgive me for saying so, sir,
but I think it wisest to ignore them,

170
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,274
and instead, work as before to...

171
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,545
S-Sorbet-sama!

172
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:04,423
Tagoma!

173
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:17,186
Sh-Shields! Raise the shields!

174
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,735
The Freeza force appears to have grown

175
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:28,781
quite fainthearted during
my absence, has it not?

176
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,909
Do you intend to allow the
universe's finest, the Freeza force,

177
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,578
to work while cowering to a handful of Saiyans?

178
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:42,169
B-But the Saiyan named Son Goku...
w-went on to become even...

179
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:46,173
What? Are you telling me
he became even stronger?

180
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:51,345
Y-Yes, sir. As difficult
as it is for me to say so...

181
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:58,435
I expected as much. I just have
to become even stronger than he is.

182
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:04,358
He even defeated Majin Boo.
We have no data after that, though.

183
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:09,154
Majin Boo? Papa said that under no circumstances

184
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,491
was I to take action against
Beers the Destroyer or Majin Boo.

185
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,410
<i>That Majin?</i>

186
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,328
Y-Yes, sir.

187
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,248
That is better than I imagined.

188
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,209
Still, does that not make this interesting?

189
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:24,878
I-interesting, sir?

190
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,257
I was born naturally gifted, after all.

191
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,968
I have never done any kind of training before,

192
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,887
nor was there ever any need for it.

193
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,390
Y-Yes, sir.

194
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:42,896
I wonder what will happen...
once I go through training,

195
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:46,442
to draw out all of my latent abilities.

196
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,029
A-Are you saying you will become even stronger?

197
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:56,201
Of course. By my prediction, let me see...

198
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,495
if I train earnestly for four months,

199
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:04,084
I should be able to reach
a battle power of 1,300,000.

200
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:29,026
I already told you,
I'm a super-elite galactic patrolman!

201
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,069
Hurry up and go get Bulma for me!

202
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:35,491
Like I said, you cannot see
her without an appointment!

203
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:41,288
You fool! I've come a long way
to tell her the earth is in danger!

204
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:44,291
Oh, if it isn't Zako-kun.

205
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,084
It's not "Zako," it's "Jaco."
[Zako: "small fry" or "guppy"]

206
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,629
Long time no see. What do you say?

207
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:52,424
Do you want me to show
you my adorable goldfish?

208
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,468
Goldfish?

209
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,435
Oh, their eyes are big, like an Erukan's.

210
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:07,564
Those are popeyed goldfish.
What do you think? Cute, huh?

211
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,740
Oh, no! Call Bulma for me!

212
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,450
O-Okay.

213
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,246
Ah, you're right. It's Jaco!
Long time no see, isn't it?

214
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:25,541
What brings you here?

215
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,001
I heard from your sister, Tights,

216
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,588
that you were friends with the man
who defeated Freeza. Is that true?

217
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:35,467
Huh? Yeah. There are two people
who have defeated Freeza.

218
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:41,014
One of them is my son Trunks;
the other is my friend Son-kun.

219
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,224
Your son?

220
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:46,186
By son, I mean my son who came
from the future in a time machine.

221
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,146
Right now, he's still a little boy.

222
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,859
From the future? That's pretty flagrant of you.

223
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:55,237
Time control is a serious
crime under galactic law!

224
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,447
I don't know anything about those laws.

225
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:02,619
W-Well, never mind. Let me meet
this friend of yours right away.

226
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:04,413
I have to tell him something.

227
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,665
That could be difficult.

228
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:10,752
Right now, he's with Beers-sama,
together with my husband.

229
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,379
Beers?

230
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:17,217
You're in the Galactic Patrol,
and you don't know? Beers the Destroyer.

231
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,469
Beers the Destroyer?

232
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,474
That's quite impossible! Beers is just a myth.

233
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,810
If that's what you think, then fine.

234
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,313
This is no time for you to be so happy-go-lucky.

235
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:30,606
Freeza has come back to life,

236
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:34,026
and he is heading toward
earth with 1,000 soldiers!

237
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,028
Huh? Freeza? You mean,

238
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,239
the same Freeza that put me through
all that trouble on Planet Namek?

239
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:42,868
Although, I don't know exactly who he is...

240
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,496
This is him.

241
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:50,083
That's Freeza?

242
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:54,546
He couldn't have come
back to life. Seriously?

243
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:55,923
Seriously.

244
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,966
With 1,000 soldiers?!

245
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,426
Yes!

246
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,595
I'm just letting you know,
I'm getting out of here.

247
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,181
That's because I'm still young,
and I don't want to die.

248
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,515
Now, if you'll excuse me...

249
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:09,686
You should tell me something
that important first! Hold on!

250
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:11,688
Hey, wait up!

251
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,067
Did they say Freeza?

252
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,154
Whis-san!

253
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:25,327
Whis-san, this is a strawberry sundae!

254
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:31,208
If you want it, contact me at once!
Otherwise, it will melt!

255
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,336
What are you doing, at a time like this?

256
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,922
I sure hope he contacts me soon.

257
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,092
Say, Jaco, when is Freeza coming?

258
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,720
Hmm... I'd say in another hour.

259
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,931
You dummy! That's in no time at all, isn't it?!

260
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,267
I have to hurry and let the others know!

261
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,690
Dummy?

262
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,703
Hey! Let's get going!

263
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,041
We did it! We'll be millionaires now!

264
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,585
We sure did it, Boss!

265
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:18,839
Whoa! Y-You idiot! Stop squirming!

266
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:26,388
Sorry...

267
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,310
They're coming after us! Yikes, better floor it!

268
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,354
R-Right!

269
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,494
Damn, this guy's persistent!

270
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,747
How do you like this?!

271
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,471
You dumb-ass!

272
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,598
That was dangerous, you know!

273
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,725
"That was dangerous, you know"?

274
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:16,438
No, you're the ones who are dangerous, you know!

275
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:24,654
Come on, guys, no more
committing robberies. Aah!

276
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:25,989
W-We're sorry! We won't do
it again! Please forgive us!

277
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:28,075
Yow-w-w...

278
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:36,541
Huh? It's Bulma-san.

279
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,339
Yes, this is Kuririn. This is a bad time,
Bulma-san. I'm on duty.

280
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:49,638
Eh? Freeza?! But that's impossible.

281
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:53,725
Right... Right... Understood.
I'll get ready at once!

282
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:59,523
I'll handle contacting
Muten Roshi-sama. Okay, goodbye.

283
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:04,319
Freeza... has come back to life?

284
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:11,952
I'm coming, too. My battle power
is much higher than all of yours.

285
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,914
No. 18, you stay here and keep Marron safe.

286
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:20,669
And more importantly, I need a favor.
Can you take care of my head?

287
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:27,008
You say Son Goku and Vegeta are
both at Beers' place, and not here?

288
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,136
Yeah, we're waiting to hear back from them.

289
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,847
I sure hope they get here soon.

290
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:36,434
But luckily, Gohan is around,
so that's encouraging.

291
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,687
All right, I'm off!

292
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,152
Pretty cool.

293
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,405
We will arrive at earth shortly, Freeza-sama.

294
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,701
Incidentally, I understand that Son Goku

295
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,912
is the only Saiyan who
defeated me that you can find.

296
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:00,500
Yes, sir. We started looking right
after you passed on, Freeza-sama,

297
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:03,461
but no matter where we looked,
we could not find the other one.

298
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,632
Perhaps he went to some
other world, or maybe he is deceased.

299
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,969
We believe that the only Saiyans
on earth are Son Goku and Vegeta,

300
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:14,181
as well as Son Goku's son.

301
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:15,849
Well, that will do.

302
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:19,394
But Freeza-sama, once you
have successfully taken revenge,

303
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:23,440
he can be brought back
to life with the Dragon Balls.

304
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:27,110
Hmph. If I destroy earth while I am at it,

305
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:31,740
then the Dragon Balls, as well
as that Hell, will cease to exist.

306
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,783
I-I see.

307
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:37,871
Incidentally, do you remember
the emergency plan, just in case?

308
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,789
O-Of course, sir.

309
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:41,750
Very good.

310
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:11,780
Oh, the flowers...

311
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,115
What are you daydreaming about?!

312
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,039
Damn it! Mock us, will you?!

313
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,464
Yowch-ch-ch...

314
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:32,425
Kakarrot, what the hell
have you been aiming for?!

315
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,136
Vegeta, you can't say that.

316
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,055
My, my...

317
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:40,558
Kakarrot, you keep out of this!
I'll take him alone this time!

318
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,727
Eh? Vegeta!

319
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:52,112
Here.

320
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,603
Gotcha.

321
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,023
C-Can't move...!

322
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:40,994
I've finally caught you! Wh-What?!

323
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:50,128
Okay, stop, stop!

324
00:27:56,593 --> 00:28:00,513
This will not do. You are
still utterly lacking in speed.

325
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,058
Look, I even signed your tops.

326
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,560
Huh? When did you...?

327
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:09,564
You two are still thinking
with your heads in order to move.

328
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:13,193
That tendency is especially
strong with you, Vegeta-san.

329
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:17,238
Doing so puts a limit on your speed.

330
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:20,241
It takes time for your brain and your senses

331
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,329
to travel along your nerves
and go throughout your bodies.

332
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,956
That's definitely true for you, Vegeta.

333
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:30,543
Shut up! Are you sure you're not just a moron?!

334
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:36,383
You just have to have each area of
your body think and move on its own,

335
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,551
but that is very difficult.

336
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,306
Not even Beers-sama has completely mastered it.

337
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:49,062
If you can overcome it, you will
also be able to avoid any danger.

338
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,855
Now, let me take the time

339
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:54,734
to take you meticulously through this training.

340
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,362
In exchange for something delicious, that is.

341
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,448
Are you saying you can do that?

342
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:02,534
Of course.

343
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,995
But Whis-san, you're stepping in doo-doo.

344
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:15,505
Shoes do not think for themselves, after all.

345
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,132
By the way, Vegeta-san...

346
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,508
Wh-What?

347
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:21,845
You being a gifted fighter notwithstanding,

348
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:25,348
you always seem to lag one
step behind Goku-san, don't you?

349
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:28,226
Tch! Th-Thanks for spelling it out.

350
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,520
Do you know why that is?

351
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,647
How should I know?!

352
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:36,192
Your nerves are always wound too tightly.

353
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:39,612
When you do that,
you cannot operate at full capacity.

354
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:43,950
It is important to get enough
rest when it's time to relax.

355
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,827
The way Goku-san does.

356
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:48,913
Ha-ha, he's right, Vegeta.

357
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,915
But, on the other hand...

358
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:59,340
Yeow! What did you do that for?!

359
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:02,302
...being too relaxed is also a problem.

360
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,847
Also, your overconfidence
in yourself is another problem.

361
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:08,433
No matter how strong you are,
if you let your mind wander,

362
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:11,102
your body becomes something fragile.

363
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,480
You show many occasions
when you are too sure of yourself,

364
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:15,023
and let your guard down.

365
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,566
Hm-hmm, he's right.

366
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:21,154
Ow-w-w... Th-That ain't fair!

367
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:25,283
What is this? You're too noisy.
I can't sleep, you know!

368
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:44,427
Y-Yikes! If we had taken that head-on,
nothing would be left of us!

369
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:47,388
He's always like this when he's sleepy.

370
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,308
When he destroyed those two suns over there,

371
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,685
it was awful how dark things became.

372
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:57,815
How did you put the suns back?
Can you make stars?

373
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:03,154
No, in cases like this, I perform a do-over.

374
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:04,656
Do-over?

375
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:08,201
I back time up just a little bit,
and before he can do something dumb,

376
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,663
I give him a quick bop on the head.

377
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:14,374
Who the hell are you, exactly?

378
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:21,089
How shall I put this? The life form named Whis?

379
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,800
Still, I do have my hands full with Beers-sama.

380
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:29,973
He's always like this, after all.
It's true. He never listens to me.

381
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:32,934
--Hey, how come you guys are here?
--Really? Beers-sama can be a pain, huh?

382
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:37,814
E-Eep! H-Hey, Beers-sama.
We're having Whis-san train us.

383
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,066
I can tell that just by looking.

384
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:42,235
I mean, how did you get here?

385
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:46,781
We contacted Whis-san,
and had him bring us here.

386
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,369
We ain't able to sense your Ki,
so that's the only thing we can do.

387
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:52,662
Whis brought you?

388
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:58,167
Hmph, I'll just bet that you bribed
him with something yummy, huh?

389
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:00,628
Well, yeah.

390
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:03,506
Why do you want to get stronger so badly?

391
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:07,760
You wouldn't be gunning for
the job of Destroyer, would you?

392
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:11,264
It ain't that. I just wanna
get stronger, that's all.

393
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:14,517
And I don't want to be left in
the dust by this bastard, that's all.

394
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:18,104
You two really don't get along well, do you?

395
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:19,772
If you two worked together,

396
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:23,318
you seem like you would be able
to go toe-to-toe against Beers-sama.

397
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:26,404
Nobody asked you what you think, Whis.

398
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:29,699
Hmph, I'd rather die than team up with him.

399
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:32,619
I ain't got any problem
with playing nice with him,

400
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:35,079
but when I fight, I want to do it alone.

401
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:36,414
My, my...

402
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:39,709
Hmph... So, what is it?

403
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,545
The treat you brought with you.

404
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:45,632
Ah, this time, it is something called pizza.

405
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,885
Oh... What an interesting name.

406
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:52,388
Don't tell me you ate it all, did you?

407
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:55,683
Beers-sama, we saved enough for you.

408
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:59,896
Well then, I think I'll have some.
But you interrupted my sleep.

409
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:03,149
If it's not delicious, I'm going
to destroy you, understand?

410
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:06,277
Well then, I will go warm it up
for you, so it tastes better.

411
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:11,324
Wait a minute. Whis, you just
said "this time," didn't you?

412
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:15,328
I get the feeling that this isn't
the first time you've come here.

413
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,010
What is that?!

414
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:17,515
They're here!

415
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,809
Somewhere near Metro North!

416
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,282
Make a little room, there.

417
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:55,303
That is just my way of saying hello.

418
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:00,850
Th-That bastard! Now he's done it!

419
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:25,666
I left Chaozu and Yamucha behind.
The danger seems too much for them.

420
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:30,254
Per Bulma-san's orders, Trunks-kun
and Goten haven't been told, either.

421
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:32,215
They would do something rash.

422
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:34,425
Hey!

423
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:40,014
Sorry we're late.

424
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:43,810
We stopped by Karin-sama's
tower for some senzu beans.

425
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:47,313
Kuririn-san! Seeing your head
like that sure takes me back!

426
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:49,982
Yeah, I know. I'm all geared up!

427
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:53,194
But never mind me,
Gohan, what's with your getup?

428
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:57,448
Y-Yeah... It happened so suddenly,
I couldn't find my gi.

429
00:35:57,657 --> 00:36:00,993
Gohan, have you been keeping
your martial arts training up?

430
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:07,250
I-I'm sorry, no. But I can still
turn Super Saiyan. Probably.

431
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,377
Is Son Goku not here yet?

432
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,255
H-He'll be here soon. Just wait!

433
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:16,884
Oh, it is you. I am sure I remember killing you.

434
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:21,597
It would seem you have come
back to life with the Dragon Balls, too.

435
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:25,685
The Dragon Balls?
Th-Then sure enough, earlier...

436
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:49,959
B-By any chance, is that guy
riding in that round thing Freeza?

437
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:53,671
You have a surprisingly
good talent for drawing, huh?

438
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,425
Bulma-san! Why would you come out here?!

439
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:00,469
I had no luck at all contacting
Son-kun and Vegeta,

440
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:02,096
so I had no choice but to come.

441
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:05,182
Okay, you come on down, too,
and fight alongside them.

442
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:07,810
No way. I said I was only going to drop you off.

443
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:14,108
What gives? You're a proud,
super-elite galactic patrolman, right?

444
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:18,696
A-All right. Okay, I'll be in
charge of the rest of the enemy army.

445
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:19,906
Who's that guy?

446
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:24,535
Beats me. Bulma-san
has a lot of strange friends.

447
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:27,955
Hmph, I thought he might be a Super Saiyan,

448
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:31,667
but that symbol is for the Galactic Patrol.

449
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,127
Hey, you!

450
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:36,964
You really don't give up, do you?
How did you come back to life?!

451
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:40,301
Y-You idiot! You could at
least speak to him more politely!

452
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:44,221
Oh, seeing as how you know who I am,

453
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,224
might you have also been there on Planet Namek?

454
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:50,770
Where is your friend, Son Goku-san?

455
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:54,649
What? You're just <i>now</i> coming
here to take your revenge?

456
00:37:56,275 --> 00:38:00,071
A lot has happened, and things
have been delayed considerably.

457
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:03,366
You'll be a pushover for
Son-kun the way he is now!

458
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:06,702
Shouldn't you leave now,
while you still have a chance?

459
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:09,205
Bulma, don't provoke him!

460
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,207
And here I have come all this way.

461
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:13,834
I suppose if all of his friends were killed,

462
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:16,712
it would be quite upsetting to him.

463
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:20,508
Gohan-kun, knowing you,
you can take him right out, can't you?

464
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,635
All of his soldiers, probably.

465
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:27,098
But Bulma-san, while you might
not realize this, Freeza is bad news.

466
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:30,184
He is so much more greatly
powered-up than he was before,

467
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:32,311
it would be fair to say
he's a whole different person.

468
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,896
I'm sorry, but...

469
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:36,857
Huh? O-Oh, no...

470
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:41,404
I-I'm sorry! Son-kun is off far away right now.

471
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:44,407
Wait just a little longer. Please?

472
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:49,120
<i>I have</i> waited quite a long time
for this moment to come already.

473
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:53,165
Very well. I shall wait another ten seconds.

474
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:54,875
T-Ten seconds?!

475
00:38:55,084 --> 00:39:00,131
What? What a stinge!

476
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,967
Well then, let us begin.

477
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:06,554
Soldiers! Let them have it!

478
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:12,518
Here they come!

479
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:19,984
Hmph! Okay, let's go!

480
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,653
Everyone take... let's see...

481
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:25,322
About 170 of them is your quota!

482
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:28,701
Hang in there until Goku and Vegeta arrive!

483
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:49,263
<i>Kamehame-Ha!!</i>

484
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:54,185
Uh-oh.

485
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:11,911
Bam!

486
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:46,695
The odds are against us
like this! Everyone, scatter!

487
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:54,829
They may be Freeza's force, but
they're still a hodgepodge bunch. Okay!

488
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,511
This may be too much for me.

489
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:28,779
<i>Kikoho!</i>

490
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:41,750
<i>Ka...</i> me... ha... me...

491
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:50,134
Can't you go easy on an old man?! Hal!

492
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:05,774
<i>Kienzan!!</i>

493
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:48,108
Here's a present!

494
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,906
What did you do, you bastard?!

495
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:56,116
You can have one, too.

496
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:04,458
Whoo, that feels lighter.

497
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:10,923
Say your prayers!

498
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:21,517
These guys don't let up!

499
00:43:54,008 --> 00:43:57,094
Thanks, Gohan. You saved me.

500
00:43:57,303 --> 00:44:01,307
Not at all. Are you okay?
Kuririn-san, please get a little rest.

501
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:03,309
I'll be right back.

502
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:09,940
Let him have it!

503
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,023
I don't know who you are,
but you're pretty good!

504
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:38,362
What about you? Who are you guys?

505
00:45:40,656 --> 00:45:43,075
I'm an earthling.

506
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:46,537
What? You're too strong to be one,
and your face looks too funny.

507
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:47,496
Cram it!

508
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:50,999
H-How can this be? Th-These guys...

509
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,961
This is not surprising at all.

510
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:56,380
If he wanted to, Son Goku's son over there

511
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:59,007
could put them all away in a single instant.

512
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:02,219
He is intentionally fighting
so as not to kill anyone.

513
00:46:02,428 --> 00:46:04,972
He is too kind, much like his father.

514
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:09,977
You see, as heinous as I am,
Son Goku did not try to kill even me.

515
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:12,729
What a man of fine character he is.

516
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:15,441
It makes me feel positively nauseous!

517
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:18,902
Freeza-sama, Sorbet-sama,
I will head out as well.

518
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:21,155
Mm-hmm, you do that.

519
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:30,247
Let me handle this one.

520
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:50,559
<i>Makankosappou!</i>

521
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,186
Did that get him?

522
00:47:09,203 --> 00:47:10,954
Piccolo-san!

523
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:20,047
Gohan!

524
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:23,467
Piccolo-san, please leave him to me!

525
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,849
Wh-What?!

526
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:44,571
Th-This can't be! Not Sisami, too!

527
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,658
You have only seen video images of them,

528
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:53,914
so you do not comprehend
the true terror of a Super Saiyan.

529
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:57,876
I did not think the son
could transform, however.

530
00:47:58,085 --> 00:47:59,336
Here.

531
00:48:00,796 --> 00:48:01,088
Here.

532
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:03,173
I don't need one.

533
00:48:03,382 --> 00:48:05,801
Finally, he's stepping forward, is he?

534
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:15,060
My, my. Not that I was unaware of this,

535
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:18,772
but the quality of the Freeza
force has fallen considerably.

536
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:21,567
S-Sorry...

537
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:26,196
Th-They're more formidable...
than we expected...

538
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:28,115
No matter.

539
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:34,413
However, your lying about all over
like this is unpleasant to look at.

540
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:39,251
Watch out! Get back!

541
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:56,059
Wh-What a monster.

542
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,814
Y-You're all pretty incredible, all right.

543
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:03,233
The biggest threat of all still remains, though.

544
00:49:03,442 --> 00:49:07,321
The terror of Freeza is legendary,
even among the Galactic Patrol.

545
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:09,031
Word is that he's ridiculously strong.

546
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:13,327
Yeah, I know that!
And what are you doing over here?

547
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:15,370
The crucial part is just
getting started, you know!

548
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:18,957
Don't be absurd. I've put in
more than my share of action.

549
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:22,544
You think I'm going to fight
against the evil emperor Freeza?

550
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:25,297
Count me out this time for sure!

551
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:35,182
What do you think? Can the five
of us manage anything against him?

552
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,476
No, not a chance.

553
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:40,812
He's a monster on an entirely
different level than we are.

554
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:45,776
Then you think so, too. That's a real shame.

555
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,737
You do not seem to be coming at me, do you?

556
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:52,741
This is dull, so what do you say I pass
the time by killing you, one at a time?

557
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:04,252
You are Son Goku's child, yes?
You certainly have grown up big.

558
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:14,221
Gohan!

559
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:18,433
Even with you being a Super Saiyan,

560
00:50:18,642 --> 00:50:22,688
it appears that you are no match
for what I have now become.

561
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:27,943
Hey, Gohan! Th-This is bad!
His heart has stopped!

562
00:50:28,151 --> 00:50:29,945
He can't eat a senzu!

563
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:32,280
Move!

564
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:38,787
Here.

565
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:44,334
My, this is a surprise. It seems
that you possess a wonder drug.

566
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:49,715
Still, how much time are you
going to be able to buy with it?

567
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:53,802
How many senzu do we have left?

568
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,846
Just one.

569
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:11,820
Whis!

570
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:13,864
Yes, what is it?

571
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:18,034
What was this called again?
This gooey, stretchy stuff?

572
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:21,455
Let's see... Yes, what was it called?

573
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:22,539
Cheese.

574
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:27,794
Yes, cheese. It's a little pungent,
but has a wonderful flavor.

575
00:51:28,003 --> 00:51:32,174
Beers-sama, don't go
interrupting our training over that.

576
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:37,387
What? You take that kind of
smart-aleck tone with a Destroyer?

577
00:51:37,596 --> 00:51:41,600
Look, don't forget that the reason
the earth that you guys are from

578
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:45,353
was not destroyed by me is
because of its delicious foods!

579
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:48,273
A-All right. Sorry.

580
00:51:52,778 --> 00:51:54,863
Hey, Whis, take a look.

581
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:58,492
A message from earth
arrived for you a good while ago.

582
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:03,455
Oh, you're right. I have a missed call.

583
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:09,085
I wonder if this might be another
scrumptious message from Bulma-san.

584
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:12,798
Sure enough. Oh, a strawberry sundae?

585
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:15,801
It does look both gorgeous and delicious.

586
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:19,554
I am quite intrigued.
Let me just check in with her...

587
00:52:19,763 --> 00:52:21,556
Hurry it up, Whis!

588
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:25,685
Hello? This strawberry sundae item of yours

589
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:28,355
wouldn't happen to be a
form of sweets, would it?

590
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:30,482
Ah! Whis-san?

591
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,860
Hey, you! You took your time
getting back to me, didn't you?!

592
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:36,071
Vegeta and Son-kun are there, right?

593
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:38,615
Tell them to come back right now!

594
00:52:38,824 --> 00:52:41,576
That evil scumbag Freeza has come back to life,

595
00:52:41,785 --> 00:52:44,204
and right now, the earth is in a real mess!

596
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:47,374
S-Scumbag?

597
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:48,959
“What?!
"Freeza?!

598
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:52,671
What do you mean!
That's impossible! How can Freeza be...?!

599
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:56,091
All right! We'll have
Whis-san bring us back right now!

600
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:57,926
It will take about 35 minutes.

601
00:52:58,134 --> 00:53:00,136
We can't wait that long!

602
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:04,266
Son-kun, you can use Instantaneous
Movement, right? Don't be a dummy!

603
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:08,812
Ah! But it's so far away,
I ain't sure I can sense any Ki on earth.

604
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,274
Freeza's Ki is a huge one,
so I'll bet you can latch on to it!

605
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:15,068
Hey! Son-kun is going to use
his Instantaneous Movement,

606
00:53:15,277 --> 00:53:17,737
so all of you raise your
powers to their maximum!

607
00:53:17,946 --> 00:53:20,740
Huh? O-Okay!

608
00:53:25,704 --> 00:53:28,456
Wh-What is this?

609
00:53:28,665 --> 00:53:34,504
It would seem that they
are calling out... to him.

610
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:37,007
I've got him! Hey, Vegeta!

611
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:39,759
Wh-What? You want me to hold your hand?!

612
00:53:39,968 --> 00:53:43,179
Hurry up! Bulma could be getting killed!

613
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:45,307
She's got a smart mouth, after all.

614
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:50,228
Okay, off we go!

615
00:53:57,986 --> 00:53:59,946
--Goku!
--Father!

616
00:54:00,155 --> 00:54:01,364
Are we in time?

617
00:54:01,573 --> 00:54:02,365
Yeah.

618
00:54:02,574 --> 00:54:04,326
Well, it was close, there.

619
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:08,246
Your timing is <i>always</i>
like this, for Pete's sake.

620
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:10,582
He-he, sorry, sorry.

621
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:15,420
You are finally here.
I have been waiting quite a while.

622
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:23,178
I am surprised to see that
Vegeta-san is with you, as well.

623
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:28,099
Still, the time for my vengeance
against you is finally at hand.

624
00:54:28,308 --> 00:54:31,811
It really does look like it's Freeza.
How did that happen?

625
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:37,108
They used the Dragon Balls.
About six months ago, wasn't it?

626
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:41,488
Earth's Hell truly was a hell.

627
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:43,907
Not only were my powers taken from me,

628
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:45,825
I was strung up like a bagworm moth,

629
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:47,911
and placed in a field of flowers,

630
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:53,416
in a clearing in the woods
where angels and fairies lived.

631
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:56,378
At times, I had to watch cute stuffed animals

632
00:54:56,586 --> 00:54:59,506
dance around, and hold parades.

633
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:04,886
Do you have any idea how
much anguish that caused me?

634
00:55:05,095 --> 00:55:09,057
That ain't on me. You're the one
who came to earth on your own,

635
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:11,267
and got yourself killed by Trunks, ain't you?

636
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:13,603
You see,

637
00:55:13,812 --> 00:55:15,689
just having you still be alive

638
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:19,401
ensures that I do not sleep well.

639
00:55:19,609 --> 00:55:22,070
So you see, after coming back to life,

640
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:27,075
I have been training, to make
sure I was not beaten by you again.

641
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:30,161
Such efforts were a first for me.

642
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,872
Me, of all people!

643
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:42,298
Sure, your level may have risen even higher.

644
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:46,302
But don't you think I've gotten stronger, too?

645
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:49,639
Quite frankly, last time,
I was caught off-guard.

646
00:55:49,848 --> 00:55:53,852
This time, I will start
right off in my final form!

647
00:56:31,973 --> 00:56:33,516
Wha--?

648
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:38,354
Just what kind of training did you do?

649
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:43,526
Th-This is not good.
Hey, everyone, get back even farther!

650
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:47,739
You ain't no pushover, that's for sure.

651
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:51,659
If you weren't rotten to the core,
you would have made a good rival.

652
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:53,036
What a waste.

653
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:58,083
More of your usual utterances
that irritate me so, I see.

654
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:10,512
Oh, are you not going to turn Super Saiyan?

655
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,307
Right now, I don't even have to resort to that.

656
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:17,977
Ho, you do seem sure of yourself.

657
00:57:18,186 --> 00:57:20,522
You might say.

658
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:24,859
Hmph, well then, how about
I begin exacting my revenge?

659
00:58:35,263 --> 00:58:36,472
How is that possible?

660
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:40,268
Goku hasn't taken a single blow,
even against a monster like that!

661
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:42,187
It's like I'm having a nightmare.

662
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:44,522
Who ever thought there
would be an earthling like that?

663
00:58:44,731 --> 00:58:47,192
He is originally a Saiyan, though.

664
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,861
Saiyan? What is a Saiyan,

665
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:52,780
a warrior race that's supposed
to be extinct, doing on earth?

666
00:58:52,989 --> 00:58:55,575
My husband over there is also a Saiyan.

667
00:58:55,783 --> 00:59:00,079
Huh? H-How can that be?
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

668
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:04,250
I'm the one who oversees earth.
I don't need the trouble.

669
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:39,410
Take this!

670
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,649
You done already?

671
01:00:36,384 --> 01:00:40,555
That's enough, damn it!
We decided we would take turns fighting!

672
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:42,598
Ee-yow!

673
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:45,143
It's still too soon!

674
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:50,565
Wh-What are those two doing?!

675
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:59,407
I see. He must still have
some sense of loyalty remaining.

676
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,749
You stay out of this, Vegeta.
I am here to defeat Son Goku-san.

677
01:01:07,957 --> 01:01:12,253
There, you see? Let me go a
little longer, and then we'll switch.

678
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:19,969
Hmph. Damn.

679
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:25,892
This is unexpected. I know
quite a bit of time has passed,

680
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:30,813
but I did not imagine that you
would have improved this much.

681
01:01:31,022 --> 01:01:33,107
Didn't I tell you so?

682
01:01:33,316 --> 01:01:36,944
Then I am glad that I trained.

683
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:41,532
I knew it. You've still
got something hidden, huh?

684
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:45,453
Well deduced. But then, so do you, right?

685
01:01:45,661 --> 01:01:49,624
Let's both go all-out.
Nothing more up our sleeves.

686
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:52,043
All right, then. You first.

687
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:56,172
Are you sure? It will take
all the wind out of your sails.

688
01:01:56,381 --> 01:01:58,007
All right, let me show you!

689
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:06,974
They're coming back down!
What are they planning to do?

690
01:02:42,427 --> 01:02:45,555
How about that?

691
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:49,392
So you end up turning Super Saiyan again?

692
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,019
But this is a little different.

693
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:54,480
It's a bit complicated and hard to explain,

694
01:02:54,689 --> 01:03:00,236
but this is a Super Saiyan level
with the power of Super Saiyan God.

695
01:03:00,445 --> 01:03:03,072
Thank goodness.

696
01:03:03,281 --> 01:03:05,032
This could have proven dangerous for me.

697
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:09,912
I was right to challenge myself
to evolve even further, just in case.

698
01:03:10,121 --> 01:03:13,833
Stop building it up and show me, already.

699
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:03,132
A-Awesome...!

700
01:04:03,341 --> 01:04:05,384
Wh-What them?

701
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:09,597
I settled on gold-colored,
to make it easy for you to understand.

702
01:04:09,805 --> 01:04:11,974
Perhaps it was too on the nose.

703
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:13,893
If you will forgive the tacky naming,

704
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:17,146
shall we call this "Golden Freeza"?

705
01:04:17,355 --> 01:04:18,856
But then, you appear to realize

706
01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:22,235
that my color is not the
only thing that has changed.

707
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:26,739
Yeah. I'm excited for this,
but I didn't expect you to come this far,

708
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:29,242
so my heart's pounding a bit, too.

709
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:33,204
This could prove to be quite
the complicated battle, yes?

710
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:35,414
You could say that.

711
01:04:35,623 --> 01:04:38,751
Hey, Vegeta! You about ready to trade yet?

712
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:45,800
D-Don't start getting smarmy on me!
You're the one that Freeza is after!

713
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:47,927
Well, let me give this a shot.

714
01:06:58,683 --> 01:07:00,518
Hello!

715
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:03,145
B-Beers-sama! Whis-san!

716
01:07:03,354 --> 01:07:06,899
Bulma-san, we are here
for that strawberry sundae.

717
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:08,984
You do have it with you, do you not?

718
01:07:09,193 --> 01:07:12,446
Huh? Oh, yeah. I did bring it with me.

719
01:07:12,655 --> 01:07:16,826
And it tastes good, right?
We came a long way, just for this.

720
01:07:17,034 --> 01:07:20,079
If it isn't, I'll destroy you.

721
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,623
Now is not the time for that!

722
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:29,088
A-All right! It might have
melted a little bit, though.

723
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:53,320
I must have put too much power into that one.

724
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:57,533
Okay, here you go.

725
01:07:57,742 --> 01:08:01,036
Whoa! That looks tasty, doesn't it?

726
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:02,830
Well then...

727
01:08:04,623 --> 01:08:08,919
Oh! This uses the ice cream
that we had before as its base, right?

728
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:13,924
These look like the brains from
the giant frogs on Planet Manu.

729
01:08:16,802 --> 01:08:22,224
Oh! This is a fruit? These are lush
and invigorating, and tasty, Whis!

730
01:08:22,433 --> 01:08:26,353
I have already had one.
I must say, while this is simple,

731
01:08:26,562 --> 01:08:28,564
it is still a delicious dessert.

732
01:08:28,773 --> 01:08:32,359
By the way, Freeza has upped
his game quite a bit, huh?

733
01:08:32,568 --> 01:08:35,362
Goku-san is having trouble with him, isn't he?

734
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:39,575
Oh, Bulma-san! This white stuff is
different from the ice cream, isn't it?

735
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:43,245
Y-Yeah, that is fresh whipped cream.

736
01:08:43,454 --> 01:08:46,248
I see Vegeta isn't fighting
alongside him, all right.

737
01:08:46,457 --> 01:08:48,125
If he did, they could beat him.

738
01:08:48,334 --> 01:08:52,755
Those two will definitely never
pair up. Their pride is too great.

739
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:55,007
What fools.

740
01:08:55,216 --> 01:08:57,426
I am with you!

741
01:09:10,606 --> 01:09:14,193
I hate to admit it, but I'm
a little bit on the ropes here...

742
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:21,742
So it would seem.

743
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:24,495
You really are an awesome son-of-a-gun.

744
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:28,874
It took me a long time
to get to where I am, too.

745
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:31,877
Playing on my mercy will do you no good.

746
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:33,921
I commend you for putting up a good fight,

747
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:36,465
but you are, after all, just a Saiyan.

748
01:09:36,674 --> 01:09:42,054
This time, I will smash you into little pieces!

749
01:09:42,263 --> 01:09:44,557
<i>G-Great!</i>

750
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:50,771
B-Beers!

751
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:53,649
What's this, Freeza? No honorific on my name?

752
01:09:53,858 --> 01:09:57,570
B-Beers-sama! Wh-What are you doing here?

753
01:09:57,778 --> 01:10:02,032
Can't you see for yourself?
I'm here to eat this!

754
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:06,412
A-Are you planning to interfere with my revenge?

755
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:11,709
Ha! None of that matters to me!
Do as you please.

756
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:14,003
But do it someplace a little farther away.

757
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:17,381
You'll get dust all over my delicious dessert.

758
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,884
Then you will not get involved, right?

759
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:25,556
I told you to do as you please.
I am a Destroyer. I take neither side.

760
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:28,350
Hold on! You're not going to help?

761
01:10:28,559 --> 01:10:29,977
A fight is a fight.

762
01:10:30,185 --> 01:10:34,148
What are you talking about?!
Everyone's going to get killed!

763
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:38,777
Buzz off! It's all right. As long
as there's something tasty to eat,

764
01:10:38,986 --> 01:10:42,990
I'll make sure that you, at least,
are spared. Stay close to me.

765
01:10:45,701 --> 01:10:48,662
Hey, is that really Beers the Destroyer?

766
01:10:48,871 --> 01:10:50,039
That's right.

767
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,374
Do you think I could get
a picture of him with me?

768
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:54,835
You can always ask him yourself.

769
01:10:55,044 --> 01:10:57,963
Don't blame me if you get destroyed, though.

770
01:10:58,172 --> 01:11:00,424
Okay, never mind.

771
01:11:00,633 --> 01:11:05,012
Well, shall we continue with my revenge?

772
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,805
You still wanna go?

773
01:11:07,014 --> 01:11:10,935
You'd better leave now on a
high note, while you're still winning.

774
01:11:11,143 --> 01:11:14,021
After you've come all
the way back to life, and all.

775
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:18,567
Do you really think I would leave,
when victory is right in front of me?

776
01:11:18,776 --> 01:11:21,528
Kakarrot, you can trade out now if you want.

777
01:11:21,737 --> 01:11:26,909
Aw, no fair! You must have
spotted Freeza's weakness, too, right?

778
01:11:27,117 --> 01:11:28,911
Weakness?

779
01:11:32,164 --> 01:11:34,416
What a ridiculous thing to say.

780
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:38,170
After fighting me just now,
you ought to know better.

781
01:11:38,379 --> 01:11:43,050
What weakness are you talking about?

782
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:46,178
It ain't here just yet.

783
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,557
You were so obsessed with taking revenge

784
01:11:50,766 --> 01:11:52,977
that you came here immediately

785
01:11:53,185 --> 01:11:56,730
after achieving that
"Golden Freeza" state, didn't you?

786
01:11:56,939 --> 01:11:59,358
So what about it?

787
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:02,736
You're consuming your power at an alarming rate.

788
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:08,158
You should have waited until you
were accustomed to it before coming.

789
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:15,040
Hmph, is that it? Then I shall hurry up
and kill you right away!

790
01:13:58,477 --> 01:14:00,145
Take this!

791
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:29,508
What?!

792
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,607
It looks like the tables are
starting to turn, just like they said.

793
01:14:45,816 --> 01:14:50,237
Just a moment, please.
That strawberry was my strawberry.

794
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:52,865
You liar! How many have you eaten?!

795
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:54,408
Three of them.

796
01:14:54,616 --> 01:14:56,160
Well, I've had two.

797
01:14:56,368 --> 01:14:59,204
No, you have eaten four of them.

798
01:14:59,413 --> 01:15:01,790
There were a total of eight strawberries.

799
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:05,586
What does it matter? I am a deity.

800
01:15:17,556 --> 01:15:19,224
<i>Ka...</i>

801
01:15:19,433 --> 01:15:21,059
<i>...me...</i>

802
01:15:21,268 --> 01:15:22,811
...ha...

803
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:25,063
<i>...me...</i>

804
01:15:25,272 --> 01:15:30,611
<i>---Ha!!</i>

805
01:15:30,819 --> 01:15:34,281
<i>l-I'll</i> just take this and...!

806
01:15:48,962 --> 01:15:50,547
Got him!

807
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:18,283
See? Just like I said. Now take
my advice. Go on and leave, now.

808
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:23,038
I promise you, I will fight you again.

809
01:16:24,498 --> 01:16:27,376
No, damn it!!

810
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:29,836
Why?!

811
01:16:30,045 --> 01:16:32,381
Why?!

812
01:16:32,589 --> 01:16:38,512
This should not be happening!

813
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:23,557
That was good work, Sorbet.

814
01:17:23,765 --> 01:17:26,268
Th-Thank you very much!

815
01:17:29,104 --> 01:17:34,651
It really is a good thing that
I had this planned, just in case.

816
01:17:51,793 --> 01:17:53,503
Goku!

817
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:03,805
Okay, your naptime is now over.

818
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:15,484
Oh, dear. Didn't I tell him so?

819
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:19,905
That was fighting dirty, but still
nicely done by Freeza, wasn't it?

820
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:51,812
Your leniency really is your weakness.

821
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:58,860
Being so overly strong, you have
a bad habit of lowering your guard.

822
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:01,071
As tough as your body may be,

823
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:03,782
you are still taken down
with a single shot from a ray gun.

824
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:07,119
How must that feel?

825
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:09,955
You are the one who is out of luck.

826
01:19:10,163 --> 01:19:16,044
You won the fight, but you have lost the battle!

827
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:22,050
The moment I have been
dreaming of has finally come!

828
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:30,308
However, it would not be as fun
if I were to just kill you like this.

829
01:19:30,517 --> 01:19:34,271
Vegeta-san, would you like me to let you do it?

830
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:39,484
I know that you despise this Saiyan, right?

831
01:19:39,693 --> 01:19:44,948
Go ahead and show your loyalty to me,
like you did so long ago.

832
01:19:45,157 --> 01:19:47,826
I will then spare you, at least.

833
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:56,334
Vegeta!

834
01:19:56,543 --> 01:19:58,545
You keep quiet!

835
01:20:02,424 --> 01:20:05,010
N-Now I've done it...

836
01:20:08,263 --> 01:20:10,682
Whis just barely warned you about this, right?

837
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:13,435
This is what makes you such an idiot.

838
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:16,771
I appreciate it, but I can't.
As aggravating as this bastard is,

839
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:22,736
I need him alive to make me stronger.
I can't afford to kill him.

840
01:20:22,944 --> 01:20:24,654
Then how about this?

841
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:28,200
I will make you the supreme
commander of the Freeza force.

842
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:31,578
Then again, right now,
that consists solely of Sorbet,

843
01:20:31,786 --> 01:20:33,830
but we can always increase that later.

844
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:38,126
What? Supreme commander? You mean that?

845
01:20:39,461 --> 01:20:41,046
Why, of course I do.

846
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:44,466
Damn, now I'm going to regret this.

847
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:46,718
Huh?

848
01:20:46,927 --> 01:20:51,848
I've already made up
my mind to utterly annihilate you.

849
01:20:52,057 --> 01:20:54,351
Wh-What did you say?!

850
01:20:54,559 --> 01:20:57,687
There's no way, after you blew up Planet Vegeta,

851
01:20:57,896 --> 01:21:01,983
that I'd have any loyalty to you, is there?

852
01:21:02,192 --> 01:21:06,655
Oh, Beers-sama, you approved of
the destruction of Planet Vegeta, right?

853
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:09,157
Shh! Keep that quiet!

854
01:21:09,366 --> 01:21:14,120
Hey, Kuririn! Give Kakarrot
a senzu, or he'll die.

855
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:16,373
O-Okay.

856
01:21:16,581 --> 01:21:18,959
I won't let that happen!

857
01:21:22,546 --> 01:21:24,047
What?!

858
01:21:37,394 --> 01:21:39,896
Hey, Goku! Snap to!

859
01:21:40,105 --> 01:21:42,816
You're lucky someone didn't want his.

860
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:49,990
Thank you, Vegeta! You saved me!

861
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:54,911
Hmph. In return, I'm taking
the best part for myself.

862
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:59,040
Yeah, I know. It's your turn.

863
01:22:04,045 --> 01:22:08,425
Th-There is no way that you can beat me!

864
01:22:32,824 --> 01:22:36,369
That's right. You didn't know, did you?

865
01:22:36,578 --> 01:22:42,417
That I can turn into a
legendary Super Saiyan, too?

866
01:23:00,018 --> 01:23:02,062
I'm sure you're well aware of this,

867
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:09,235
but I'm not as forgiving
as he is. Say your prayers.

868
01:23:09,444 --> 01:23:14,532
Vegeta, that's pretty big talk,
c-coming from you.

869
01:23:53,905 --> 01:23:58,743
Wh-Why, you...! This is impossible...!

870
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:05,375
You're finished now.

871
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:11,297
And don't ever come back to life again!

872
01:24:15,093 --> 01:24:17,303
Same to all of you!

873
01:24:17,512 --> 01:24:19,055
What?!

874
01:24:35,447 --> 01:24:36,865
Uh-oh. Hey, Whis!

875
01:24:37,073 --> 01:24:38,450
Right!

876
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,069
H-How could he do that?!

877
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:18,698
Th-The earth... The earth...

878
01:25:21,284 --> 01:25:26,623
Vegeta! Trunks! Papa and Mama!

879
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:31,503
Th-That bastard! He's
taken them all down with him!

880
01:25:31,711 --> 01:25:36,674
Oh, no. Freeza is likely not dead.

881
01:25:36,883 --> 01:25:42,555
He can survive in the vacuum of space.
Hmm, that's smart thinking.

882
01:25:42,764 --> 01:25:45,934
Damn! What a monster!

883
01:25:46,142 --> 01:25:49,437
The Dragon Balls have been obliterated,

884
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:51,815
so there's no way to undo this.

885
01:25:52,023 --> 01:25:54,317
D-Damn it...

886
01:25:54,526 --> 01:25:58,571
I-I should have settled things right away.

887
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:01,366
Then, would you like to settle things?

888
01:26:01,574 --> 01:26:02,784
Huh?

889
01:26:02,992 --> 01:26:05,745
You brought this on yourself
because of your leniency.

890
01:26:05,954 --> 01:26:10,083
Send Freeza back to his flower garden.

891
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:12,961
Wh-What do you mean?

892
01:26:15,088 --> 01:26:18,842
All right, I will now turn back time.

893
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:22,762
We must hurry.
Three minutes is my limit, after all.

894
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:25,598
Huh? Y-You don't mean...

895
01:26:25,807 --> 01:26:28,935
Yes. A do-over.

896
01:26:45,368 --> 01:26:50,415
Wh-Why, you...! This is impossible...!

897
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:56,796
You're finished now.

898
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:02,260
And don't ever come back to life again!

899
01:27:06,222 --> 01:27:08,433
Same to all of you!

900
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:10,518
Freeza 1!

901
01:27:10,727 --> 01:27:12,270
Wh-What?!

902
01:27:14,856 --> 01:27:17,859
Hal!

903
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:23,573
Wh-Wha--?!

904
01:27:25,617 --> 01:27:30,204
D-Damn it all!!

905
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:50,224
Whew, we're saved.

906
01:27:50,433 --> 01:27:52,518
Kakarrot! What did you do?!

907
01:27:52,727 --> 01:27:56,814
N-No, Vegeta! I'm sorry,
I'm sorry! I can explain!

908
01:27:57,023 --> 01:28:00,735
I don't care what you can explain!
You said it was my turn!

909
01:28:00,944 --> 01:28:03,029
It's all right, Vegeta!

910
01:28:03,237 --> 01:28:06,866
Son-kun just saved you and the whole earth!

911
01:28:07,075 --> 01:28:11,120
He what? What does she mean? Tell me!

912
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,463
--Father, we were really worried about you!
--Man, we're really glad you were here. Thanks.

913
01:28:20,672 --> 01:28:23,633
Well, well, what a sorry tale.

914
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:27,053
I mean, a Destroyer, bringing a planet <i>back.</i>

915
01:28:27,261 --> 01:28:31,891
I will get a huge feast
ready for the two of you.

916
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:35,937
Once we put Metro North back
with the Dragon Balls, that is.

917
01:28:36,145 --> 01:28:41,818
I look forward to it.
That is the reason why I turned back time.

918
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:43,695
Are you sure you don't want to arrest him?

919
01:28:43,903 --> 01:28:46,864
Time control is a serious crime, right?

920
01:28:47,073 --> 01:28:49,659
I didn't see anything.

921
01:28:52,829 --> 01:28:56,708
What? I'm not going to thank you.
We're even, after all.

922
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:59,335
It ain't that, Vegeta.

923
01:28:59,544 --> 01:29:02,922
If we had teamed up from
the start, like Whis-san said,

924
01:29:03,131 --> 01:29:05,591
we never would have gotten in such a tight spot.

925
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,636
Do you think we should
pair together once in a while?

926
01:29:08,845 --> 01:29:11,764
Hmph, I'll still never do that.

927
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:16,519
Terrific! Me, neither!

928
01:29:16,728 --> 01:29:19,772
Heh, for the first time, we agree on something.

929
01:33:26,269 --> 01:33:28,896
Welcome home!

930
01:33:30,147 --> 01:33:39,740
No!!
