1
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:11,536
Gone forever.

2
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,986
Telling you that she
wasn't coming home,

3
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:33,058
was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.

4
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:38,784
But then, Scott showed up...

5
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,192
Or should I say, broke
into our house.

6
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:46,090
And when he went to
the Quantum Realm....

7
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:52,315
And came back,
everything changed.

8
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,307
I started to wonder...

9
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,112
Could your Mother
still be alive?

10
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:03,841
So I dusted off some old plans.

11
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,439
Dad, what are you saying?

12
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:19,540
I think it's possible,
to bring her back.

13
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,069
Okay. We're in.

14
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:07,804
Aw, this place is a maze.
Where's that map?

15
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,976
We're definitely close.

16
00:04:13,013 --> 00:04:14,653
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready, Daddy.

17
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:18,067
Are you sure? Once we're inside,
you show any hesitation or fear,

18
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,848
- we're done.
- I eat fear for breakfast.

19
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,848
Wow. That is super cool.
Come on.

20
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:32,281
Look! It's Anton. He'll
show us the way.

21
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:34,719
Anton, which way do we go?

22
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:39,325
Anton, which way do we go?

23
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,477
Thanks, Anton.

24
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:52,547
Look! The ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

25
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:54,789
Oh, no! Lasers!

26
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:59,055
Oh! I got lased!

27
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:03,632
The secret vault.

28
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:07,187
- Tell me you brought the contact lens.
- Yup!

29
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,859
Perfect! Right there.

30
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,476
There! It's the microtreasure.

31
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,617
My trophy?

32
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:23,367
- It looks like treasure.
- Oh, it is to me.

33
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:26,851
- I wanna take it to show and tell.
- Oh, you can't do that. Can't.

34
00:05:26,914 --> 00:05:29,234
It never leaves the house.
It's too important.

35
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:31,898
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

36
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:34,694
I'm so touched you think I'm
the World's Greatest Grandma.

37
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,569
- It was the only one they have.
- It makes me wanna get you a sweater.

38
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,382
- Oh, no, the fuzz!
- Hey, Scotty.

39
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:44,999
I was looking at the schematics
for the Karapetyan buildings,

40
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,835
and I think we have way too
many security cams, don't we?

41
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:50,632
- No, not at all.
- 'Cause, it's a lot of security cameras.

42
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:53,390
I know what he needs. Who's the
security expert in our business?

43
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,148
You are. But I'm running
the company, right?

44
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:57,953
And if we overcoat him, he's gonna go
somewhere else, so we got to land this bird.

45
00:05:57,976 --> 00:06:00,476
He can go on anywhere. And the
expression is "landing the fish."

46
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:02,249
No, it's "land the bird."

47
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:04,578
Just like landing a plane. You gotta
land the plane to be in business.

48
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:07,108
I know it's silly to get hung up on
these kinds of things. But I do...

49
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:09,522
How am I gonna land a fish?
It can't walk.

50
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:13,139
And if it swam up on shore, and it
battled a hawk, who's gonna win?

51
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,038
You've really turned me
around on this thing.

52
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,623
It's okay. We're gonna
land Karapetyan.

53
00:06:18,648 --> 00:06:21,733
Now if you'd just excuse me, I'm in the middle
of trying to steal something with my daughter.

54
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:23,132
I'm gonna go recheck it.

55
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:25,639
Don't just stand there!

56
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,256
Let's bounce before
the po-po come back!

57
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,248
Po-po? How do you
even know that?

58
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:35,428
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

59
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,325
Crash landing!

60
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:53,942
- I wish we could shrink for real.
- It is pretty cool.

61
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,050
Hey, I'm headed to
the office, Scotty.

62
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,715
Hey, sorry about freaking
out earlier, you know?

63
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:00,715
But I feel like... I'm way better. Like, my heart
is definitely like, beating way too hard and stuff?

64
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:03,465
And, like, my hands are shaking. But
I think it's unrelated, you know?

65
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,934
It's gonna be great, Luis. You
got nothing to worry about.

66
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:08,527
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

67
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,418
I'm the boss. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

68
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:11,621
Daddy!

69
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:19,871
Come on, Woo. I've
got three days left.

70
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,747
- Why would I try to escape?
- Sorry, Scott. Rules are rules.

71
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:24,708
You trip a perimeter alarm
and we search the place.

72
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:27,200
Keel, stern, suits and nuts.

73
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:30,278
Thank you. It was an accident.
My foot went through the fence.

74
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:31,864
Our flying ant crashed.

75
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:35,544
Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year
old when you can't leave the house.

76
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,687
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

77
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:40,676
Close-up magic.

78
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,856
I learned that.

79
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:47,746
Why can't you just
leave my Daddy alone?

80
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:49,723
Oh, Cassie.

81
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:54,278
This must all seem like a bunch of
confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh?

82
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:55,973
Well, think of it this way:

83
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,332
Your school has rules, right?
Like...

84
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,278
You can't draw on the walls.

85
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:04,106
Well, your Daddy went to Germany and
drew on the walls with Captain America.

86
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:08,900
And that was a violation of Article 16,
Paragraph 3 of the Sokovia Accords.

87
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:13,112
Now as a part of his joint plea deal with
Homeland Security and the German government,

88
00:08:13,137 --> 00:08:17,394
he's allowed to return to the U.S., provided
he serve two years under house arrest,

89
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,504
followed by three
years of probation.

90
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:22,441
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology,

91
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:26,332
or contact with any former associates,
who were or currently are,

92
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:29,878
in violation of said Accords.
Or any related statutes.

93
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:31,386
Okay, sweetie?

94
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,551
Wow. You're really
great with kids!

95
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,738
Thanks. I'm also a youth pastor.

96
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:39,363
Anyway, not to be a
Johnny Ass-calade,

97
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:42,473
but you haven't had any contact with
Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

98
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,129
- No.
- You sure?

99
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:46,325
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get them.

100
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,005
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

101
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:52,021
Associating with them breaks your deal.
And, uhh...

102
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,045
I don't need to
remind you, that...

103
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:58,024
Any violation of your agreement
means 20 years in prison. Minimum.

104
00:08:58,048 --> 00:09:00,344
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

105
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:02,828
- They hate his guts.
- Thanks, Peanut.

106
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:07,313
- How'd you do it, Scott?
- Do what?

107
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:10,336
The card trick?

108
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,797
Seriously?

109
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:29,024
Oh, my God!

110
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:32,938
You people can't just show up here,
whenever you want and search the place.

111
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:34,185
Actually, they can.

112
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:36,349
- You need a warrant.
- Actually, they don't.

113
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:38,349
Really? Wow.

114
00:09:38,482 --> 00:09:42,044
- Did you pack your soccer shoes?
- Yeah.

115
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,341
Next time I see you,
will be on the outside!

116
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:50,440
I'll get on the inside of this.

117
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:52,166
- Three days!
- Seriously?

118
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,377
- I'm proud of you, buddy.
- Thank you.

119
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:55,792
- You know what? Give me another one.
- Me, too!

120
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:59,808
Freedom, business, I'm
sensing greatness.

121
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:02,502
- I had a fun weekend, Daddy.
- Me too, Peanut.

122
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:06,050
Just wait till next weekend. Once I'm outta
here, we're gonna go paint this town red.

123
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:09,075
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

124
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:19,236
- You're getting good at that.
- How'd you do that?

125
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:21,284
- Bye, Daddy!
- Bye!

126
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:24,761
- Bye!
- Bye!

127
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,417
Three days...

128
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:31,362
Easy-peasy.

129
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:42,315
Snap your fingers. That
gets them to look over there.

130
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,573
Now that is misdirection.

131
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:26,409
Easy-peasy.

132
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:51,804
Lost... in the
Quantum Realm.

133
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:00,888
What?

134
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,739
I'm gonna find
you, Jellybean.

135
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:11,699
I found you!

136
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:14,066
You always find
me, Mommy.

137
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:16,175
What the hell?

138
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,962
Hey, Hank.

139
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:33,557
It's been a while.

140
00:12:33,924 --> 00:12:37,018
Umm... I don't even know
if this is your number...

141
00:12:37,065 --> 00:12:38,065
Anymore... and,

142
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:40,892
I'm probably the last person
you wanna hear from. But...

143
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,372
I just had a really
weird dream.

144
00:12:44,427 --> 00:12:48,466
And I know that doesn't sound like an
emergency or anything, but it just felt...

145
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:50,880
Very real.

146
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,358
I was back in the
Quantum Realm, and...

147
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:57,529
I think I saw your wife.

148
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,240
And then I
was your wife.

149
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:03,512
I mean, not in
a weird way, or...

150
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,270
You know...

151
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:10,143
Hearing this out loud, I'm
thinking, it's not an emergency.

152
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:12,486
I'm sorry I
bothered you.

153
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,697
I'm sorry for
a lot of things.

154
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:08,653
Hope?

155
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,088
Is this another dream?

156
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:15,970
Do you think it's a dream? Or is it possible
that you really saw my Mom down there?

157
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:18,587
I'm not sure.

158
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:24,685
I can't be here! I can't be,
I'm under house arrest.

159
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:27,887
They won't open while the
system's engaged, Scott.

160
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:48,677
You have to
take me home.

161
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,427
- They can show up any second.
- Relax...

162
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:53,044
As far as your nanny cops
know, you're still at home.

163
00:14:59,395 --> 00:15:00,652
Woah!

164
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:07,752
Scotty?

165
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:10,221
He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.

166
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:12,705
Nine hours in bed, five
hours in front of the TV,

167
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,120
two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

168
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:16,816
That's totally inaccurate.

169
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:19,177
How do you know about my daily
routine? Are you spying on me?

170
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:21,339
We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?

171
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:23,904
And so far, the biggest
one we've had is you.

172
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:28,075
I'm sorry about Germany.

173
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:31,254
They just showed up. They said it
was a matter of national security,

174
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:33,785
- That Cap needed help.
- Who's Cap?

175
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,511
...tain America.
Captain... Cap.

176
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,942
It's what we call him.

177
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:44,070
If you're a friend. I think I'm a friend,
a little. I know him. He's not, we're not...

178
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:46,798
I'm sorry! All right? I didn't
think I'd get caught.

179
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:49,151
You didn't think
about a lot of things.

180
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,135
How's Hank?

181
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,667
We're still running, the house is gone. So
is our freedom. How do you think he is?

182
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,845
I'm sorry. I know
you're mad.

183
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:58,276
I'm not looking
for apologies, Scott.

184
00:15:58,301 --> 00:16:02,261
The only reason why we're even talking
is because we need what's in your head.

185
00:16:40,363 --> 00:16:42,441
Is this where
you're living?

186
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:46,925
If you need help, money
or something, maybe I can...

187
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:48,316
We're fine.

188
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:47,531
Hey, Hank. Look...

189
00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:49,726
- I just want to...
- Save it.

190
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,871
- Can we start?
- Yeah.

191
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:59,754
So, while you were relaxing
at home, we were building this.

192
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:04,145
It's a tunnel. To
the Quantum Realm.

193
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:05,575
To my Mom.

194
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:08,192
We think she might still be down
there, we just don't know where.

195
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:09,216
What?

196
00:18:09,365 --> 00:18:13,388
If we can pinpoint my Mom's location,
then the pod can take me down to get her.

197
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,239
You built all this and you
don't even know if she's alive?

198
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:18,284
It's called a hypothesis.

199
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:23,137
Last night we powered up the tunnel for the
first time. It overloaded, and it shut down.

200
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:25,082
But for a split second,

201
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:29,066
the doorway to the
Quantum Realm was opened.

202
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:30,114
And?

203
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:33,731
And five minutes later, you
called. Talking about Mom.

204
00:18:33,794 --> 00:18:36,739
We think when you went down there,
you may have entangled with her.

205
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,324
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

206
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:41,426
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

207
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:46,214
We think she might have put some kind of
message in your head. Hopefully, a location.

208
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,831
And opening the
tunnel triggered it.

209
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:51,433
Your Mom put a message in my
head? Come on. That's insane.

210
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,932
No, Scott. Insane...

211
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:57,590
is going to Germany without
telling us and fighting the Avengers.

212
00:18:57,615 --> 00:19:00,762
Just tell me you weren't
lying about the suit you took.

213
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:03,988
Tell me you
really destroyed it.

214
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,207
I did. I destroyed it. I swear.

215
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:08,769
I can't believe you
destroyed my suit.

216
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:10,694
That was my life's work.

217
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:14,907
- What was I supposed to do?
- You were supposed to not take my suit!

218
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,481
I'm sorry, Hank. I'm
sorry I took the suit.

219
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:19,763
I'm sorry that
I called last night.

220
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:23,341
I don't remember seeing Janet
down there. I wish that I did.

221
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:27,075
I just had a dream about her playing
hide and seek with a little girl.

222
00:19:29,504 --> 00:19:30,628
What?

223
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:37,093
I had a dream. She was playing
hide and seek with a little...

224
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,640
girl. Cassie and I do it all the
time. It doesn't mean anything.

225
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,210
But, was it Cassie
in the dream?

226
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,291
No.

227
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:46,283
- Where was she hiding?
- What?

228
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:49,564
The little girl, where was she
hiding. Was it in a wardrobe?

229
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:52,338
No, it's in a tall dresser.

230
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:55,096
- You mean a wardrobe.
- Is that what that's called?

231
00:19:55,135 --> 00:19:59,135
- What color was it?
- Red.

232
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:04,135
- Were there horses on it?
- Oh, boy.

233
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,221
It's where I hid every
time we played.

234
00:20:08,362 --> 00:20:11,830
Doesn't sound like you really
got the gist of the game.

235
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:15,126
She's alive!

236
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,345
I knew it.

237
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,837
I knew it!

238
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:24,908
- We need to get that part.
- Okay.

239
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:29,689
The sooner we get the tunnel working, the
sooner we can get this message out his head.

240
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:31,526
- Does Burch have it?
- Yeah. Let's go.

241
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:35,402
What part? Who's Burch?
Wait, what's happening?

242
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:39,328
We need a component to stop
the tunnel from overloading again.

243
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:42,921
I brought your clothes.
You might wanna change.

244
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,046
Look. I'd really like
to help you out.

245
00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:58,179
But if I'm not home when they come to take off
my ankle monitor then I'm going away forever.

246
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:02,453
Once we get the component and power up the tunnel,
we'll get the message and have you home by lunch.

247
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:04,751
We have to hurry. The
entanglement won't last.

248
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:06,283
You owe us.

249
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:10,313
All right, fine. But can I just wait inside?
Because I'm not supposed to be out here.

250
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:21,886
Let's go.

251
00:21:38,857 --> 00:21:40,559
- We good?
- Yeah.

252
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:42,403
I'll be right back.

253
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:51,481
- Can I have one of those?
- No.

254
00:22:07,045 --> 00:22:08,365
Susan!

255
00:22:08,404 --> 00:22:10,693
- Welcome to Oui!
- Sonny.

256
00:22:10,842 --> 00:22:14,061
Oui is French for yes. As
in, yes, we found a table,

257
00:22:14,096 --> 00:22:16,353
yes, you saw
us, and yes,

258
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,885
to planning before property.

259
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,978
Well, let's hope it
also means yes to

260
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:23,408
do you have the
component I ordered?

261
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:27,579
You know, I've always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

262
00:22:27,837 --> 00:22:29,618
- Have a seat.
- No, I'm good. Thank you.

263
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,923
- Who is this guy?
- Sonny Burch.

264
00:22:31,963 --> 00:22:34,658
He traffics in black
market technology.

265
00:22:34,683 --> 00:22:37,824
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

266
00:22:38,994 --> 00:22:41,814
- Can I just have one?
- No.

267
00:22:42,714 --> 00:22:47,940
You know, I have a special friend, down
at the FBI. And I say special, because...

268
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,846
Well, he tells me things that
I didn't previously know.

269
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,815
For example...

270
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,182
Your name isn't Susan.

271
00:22:56,246 --> 00:22:58,784
It's Hope Van Dyne.

272
00:22:58,886 --> 00:23:01,722
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

273
00:23:01,738 --> 00:23:04,323
- That's not good, Hank.
- No shit.

274
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:13,736
What do you want?

275
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:16,267
Relationships are
built on trust, Hope.

276
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:18,595
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

277
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:22,188
- Our relationship?
- Well, business landscape's been shifting, Hope.

278
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:26,377
Hell, screw it. I don't even exist
anymore. But now, Hank Pym?

279
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,330
- Hank Pym, is a real opportunity.
- Do you have a point?

280
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,479
You think that I don't know what
you've been building? With all of this?

281
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:36,682
Quantum technology.

282
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:40,831
And you can forget nano-tech.
Forget AI. Forget cryptocurrency.

283
00:23:40,855 --> 00:23:44,230
Quantum energy is the future.
It's the next gold rush.

284
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:47,041
I want in, Hope.

285
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,772
So, as a gesture of goodwill,
I've taken the liberty

286
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:52,491
of arranging some
buyers for your lab.

287
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:57,412
Starting bid?
One billion dollars.

288
00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:59,162
Thank you,
Sonny. Really.

289
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:03,221
But my father and I have something slightly
more pressing than starting a business.

290
00:24:03,252 --> 00:24:06,384
So, I'll just take the component.
As arranged.

291
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:09,587
My buyers don't take
no for an answer.

292
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:14,726
So, we're either in business together,
or we aren't in business together.

293
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,378
- Then, I guess we aren't.
- You can go.

294
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:24,685
But, I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

295
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,856
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

296
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:29,633
Listen, Sonny.

297
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:34,015
This is gonna be so much easier on
everybody if you just give me that component.

298
00:24:34,078 --> 00:24:37,757
No, the only thing you're
taking from here, is my heart.

299
00:24:38,094 --> 00:24:40,515
But it will mend in time.

300
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:42,874
Okay.

301
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:53,736
- So now, what?
- You'll see.

302
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:56,822
She said her and daddy
had something pressing.

303
00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:00,564
I wanna know what it is, 'cause if they're not
working with us, they're working with somebody.

304
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:02,383
So find out. Name...

305
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,749
Hold on. You
gave her wings?

306
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:34,269
Not my 36-feet chandelier!

307
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:39,995
Stop firing! Stop!

308
00:25:44,131 --> 00:25:47,123
Alright, take this. Go.
Go, go, go, go!

309
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:51,522
Wings and blasters.

310
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:53,538
I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me?

311
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:54,842
No, I did.

312
00:26:56,585 --> 00:26:58,788
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

313
00:26:58,907 --> 00:27:01,719
Oh, our business isn't
finished yet, Hope.

314
00:27:01,774 --> 00:27:03,906
I can assure
you of that.

315
00:27:10,688 --> 00:27:12,776
What the hell is that?

316
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,644
Dad, are you
seeing this?

317
00:27:27,668 --> 00:27:29,933
Hope, get out of there!

318
00:27:37,626 --> 00:27:39,705
- I gotta do something.
- Wait!

319
00:27:44,775 --> 00:27:47,198
It's still a work in progress.

320
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:07,865
You taught me that
kick. Remember?

321
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:10,154
- Yeah, great form.
- Those were the days.

322
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,841
- Whatever happened to us?
- Not the time, Scott.

323
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:15,045
Dammit, where did he go?

324
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:17,883
I lost it.

325
00:28:17,931 --> 00:28:20,580
I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.

326
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,274
Dad?

327
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:34,062
Give me that. Now.

328
00:28:38,626 --> 00:28:41,240
- Are you okay?
- No. He got the lab.

329
00:28:41,282 --> 00:28:42,860
- No.
- Come on.

330
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:48,130
- What was that?
- I don't know.

331
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:51,677
But we need to find somewhere to
regroup and figure out where the lab is.

332
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:54,419
So where to now?

333
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:57,262
How about my house? Mmm?
I'm supposed to be there anyway.

334
00:28:57,348 --> 00:29:01,035
- Woo could walk in any second.
- Exactly why we're not going to your house.

335
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:02,863
What about your house?

336
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:04,488
Sorry.

337
00:29:06,401 --> 00:29:08,355
There is one place
I can think of.

338
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:10,043
No.

339
00:29:10,153 --> 00:29:13,176
No, no! No! No!

340
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:16,073
No!

341
00:29:18,847 --> 00:29:20,222
Wow, Dr. Pym.

342
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:22,237
Like, who would've thought
that, once again,

343
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:25,104
in your hour of need, that you
would turn to us? You know?

344
00:29:25,457 --> 00:29:27,152
Not me.

345
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,511
Help yourself.

346
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:31,339
That was overexpensive pastry.
We gotta keep the food budget down.

347
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:33,354
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

348
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:36,089
- The oatmeal packets.
- Oatmeal packets.

349
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:37,795
- It's insult.
- Why's it insult?

350
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:40,545
- Because it takes like sand.
- You know why? Cause it's organic.

351
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,068
- That is not organic. It's sand.
- The most important meal of the day.

352
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:46,302
You know what, you can get creative
with it. Put a little brown sugar on it.

353
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,037
 Sprinkle some cinnamon...

354
00:29:48,068 --> 00:29:50,880
Guys, guys, guys, guys!
Come on, man!

355
00:29:50,904 --> 00:29:52,833
We got bigger fish to fry.

356
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,414
- Is that my desk?
- Yeah.

357
00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:57,809
What? Why do I have
such a small desk?

358
00:29:57,834 --> 00:30:00,552
- Cause you weren't there when we're choosing desks.
- You snooze, you lose.

359
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:02,115
- I was under house arrest.
- Yeah!

360
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:04,630
You know what, this isn't
even a desk. This is garbage.

361
00:30:04,662 --> 00:30:07,276
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

362
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:08,675
I got it out of
rummage sale.

363
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,035
- So, you saved money on my desk?
- Guys.

364
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,637
Hope, please! We need
to focus. All right?

365
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:16,149
We gotta find that
lab already. Geez.

366
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:19,381
Oh, you know what? I heard stories,
like what happened to you.

367
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:22,006
Like this crazy, creepy cat who like,
walks through walls and stuff.

368
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:23,679
Like a... Like a Ghost!

369
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:25,913
Like Baba Yaga.

370
00:30:28,296 --> 00:30:30,733
Baba Yaga. A witch.

371
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:33,538
They tell stories to
children to frighten them.

372
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:37,257
You know Baba Yaga?

373
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:39,101
Whoever stole it...

374
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,460
We need to find it.

375
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,764
Well, you don't find
someone like that.

376
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:45,623
- They find you.
- Like Baba Yaga.

377
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:48,741
Dr. Pym, you're like the
smartest genius I know.

378
00:30:48,864 --> 00:30:51,270
Did you put some kind
of lojack on your lab?

379
00:30:51,324 --> 00:30:54,402
Because if you didn't, we have a
variety of affordable options.

380
00:30:54,457 --> 00:30:56,589
Of course, I did, Luis.

381
00:30:56,756 --> 00:30:58,121
It was disabled.

382
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,863
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

383
00:31:00,904 --> 00:31:03,933
- They also looked like they were phasing.
- Phasing?

384
00:31:03,957 --> 00:31:07,222
Quantum phasing. When an object
moves through different states of matter.

385
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:09,160
Oh, yeah. That's what
I was thinking.

386
00:31:09,207 --> 00:31:13,035
The lab emits radiation. Could we modify
a quantum spectrometer and track it?

387
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,972
That could work, yes. But all
of my equipment is in the lab.

388
00:31:16,027 --> 00:31:18,370
Well, where else can
we find that equipment?

389
00:31:19,988 --> 00:31:22,175
Well, there is one person.

390
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:25,074
- Bill Foster.
- Great!

391
00:31:25,308 --> 00:31:26,355
Who's Bill Foster?

392
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,261
He's an old colleague
of my Dad's. From SHIELD.

393
00:31:29,307 --> 00:31:33,074
- They had a falling out years ago.
- You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.

394
00:31:33,245 --> 00:31:35,175
It's probably just
a waste of time.

395
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,494
Hey, I'm risking everything by being
here. Don't you think we should check?

396
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:41,166
We need to find out
who took the lab.

397
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:36,327
Guys, it's not a good idea
to be out in the open like this.

398
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:39,420
Relax. No one's gonna
recognize us.

399
00:32:39,545 --> 00:32:41,920
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?

400
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:43,514
It's not a disguise, Hank.

401
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:45,944
We look like ourselves
in a baseball game.

402
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,983
In an isolated system...

403
00:32:48,054 --> 00:32:50,163
Particles co-exist in a

404
00:32:50,226 --> 00:32:54,733
stable phase relationship. If
the system is interfered with,

405
00:32:54,744 --> 00:32:58,048
that stability becomes chaos.

406
00:32:58,345 --> 00:33:00,134
Unpredictable.

407
00:33:00,307 --> 00:33:01,548
Dangerous.

408
00:33:01,572 --> 00:33:03,048
Beautiful.

409
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:07,720
Isolated completely, a quantum system would
revert back to separate states of matter.

410
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:11,480
Each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

411
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:13,010
In other words...

412
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:16,082
The object in question would
be both in and out of phase

413
00:33:16,106 --> 00:33:19,020
with multiple parallel realities.

414
00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:27,419
Speaking of being out
of phase with reality...

415
00:33:27,849 --> 00:33:33,364
I am noticing an unusally high number
of glazed eyes out there among you.

416
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:37,272
So, why don't we call
it a few minutes early.

417
00:33:37,297 --> 00:33:41,399
That will be enough for today, thank
you, ladies and gentlemen. You may go.

418
00:33:42,492 --> 00:33:45,765
It's incredible.
Your link to Janet.

419
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,970
It's Quantum entanglement,

420
00:33:46,995 --> 00:33:50,321
between the quantum states composed
of her molecules and your brains.

421
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:52,323
Yeah. It's what I
was thinking.

422
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:55,095
Do you guys just put the word
'quantum' in front of everything?

423
00:33:55,112 --> 00:33:56,760
Doctor, we need to find our lab.

424
00:33:56,819 --> 00:33:59,670
Hope, I'd love to help you but I don't
have the equipment you're describing.

425
00:33:59,686 --> 00:34:02,076
I told you this was a waste of time.
Come on. Let's go.

426
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:03,623
Don't condescend, Hank.

427
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:05,476
You're the one who's on
the run from the FBI.

428
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:07,561
All because you had
to grow to a size

429
00:34:07,586 --> 00:34:09,498
that finally fit your ego.

430
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:12,920
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

431
00:34:13,388 --> 00:34:14,534
Really?

432
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:17,292
Going that big must've
been exhausting.

433
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,050
I slept for three days straight.
You have no idea.

434
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:21,183
Actually, I do.

435
00:34:21,214 --> 00:34:24,730
Back in the day, I was Hank's partner
in a project called Goliath.

436
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:26,486
Excuse me, you were my partner?

437
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:28,948
The only thing more tiring
than going that big,

438
00:34:28,964 --> 00:34:30,956
is putting up with
Hank's bullshit.

439
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:36,592
How big did you get?

440
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:37,654
My record?

441
00:34:37,672 --> 00:34:38,929
Twenty-one feet.

442
00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:40,695
- Not bad.
- You?

443
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:43,335
- I don't...
- No, really. I'm curious.

444
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:45,679
- Sixty-five feet. Yeah.
- Whoa.

445
00:34:45,704 --> 00:34:47,079
- Huge.
- Sixty-five.

446
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,797
If you two are finished
comparing sizes...

447
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,563
We need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.

448
00:34:52,595 --> 00:34:56,704
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet? Strange.

449
00:34:57,267 --> 00:35:00,587
He had all the answers back in the day.
That's why I left the project.

450
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:02,938
Left? I fired you.

451
00:35:02,962 --> 00:35:05,476
Best decision I ever made.
Hank was a terrible partner.

452
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:08,392
Temperamental. Stubborn.
Impatient.

453
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:10,740
Sooner or later he just
pushed everyone away.

454
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:12,141
Just the mediocrities.

455
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:15,734
Janet was the only one who could
endure him and chose to stick it out.

456
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:16,649
Watch it, Bill.

457
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,546
She paid the price
though, didn't she?

458
00:35:18,571 --> 00:35:19,362
You son of a...

459
00:35:19,387 --> 00:35:21,759
We didn't come here to
listen to you two squabble.

460
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:23,926
I'm trying to save my Mother.

461
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:28,159
It's Woo.

462
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:29,885
Someone must have seen me.

463
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:33,095
Relax. If this is about you
they'd be in your house by now.

464
00:35:35,627 --> 00:35:37,752
- What are you, fifteen?
- Come on. We gotta go, right now.

465
00:35:37,777 --> 00:35:40,956
Wait! You might be able to
improvise that tracker.

466
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:44,448
If you modify the defraction
units on one of your regulators.

467
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:46,534
- That could work.
- I don't know what that means.

468
00:35:46,555 --> 00:35:49,055
Thank you.

469
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,380
But Doctor, campus police says
they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.

470
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,677
I don't know what
to tell you, agent.

471
00:36:04,702 --> 00:36:06,904
I haven't talked to
Hank in thirty years.

472
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,130
I can assure you I'm the last
person he would wanna visit.

473
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,607
- Oh, come on. You expect us to...
- Hey, hey.

474
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:14,224
- Why is that?
- Simple.

475
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:16,217
We hate each other's guts.

476
00:36:17,104 --> 00:36:18,934
So I'm a terrible partner?

477
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:22,318
Foster, he hasn't had one good
idea in his unremarkable career.

478
00:36:22,343 --> 00:36:24,413
But his idea about the
defractors could work.

479
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:26,584
Fine, one decent idea.

480
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,428
Except I eliminated the defractors
when I upgraded the suits.

481
00:36:32,963 --> 00:36:35,088
So if we had an old suit,

482
00:36:35,113 --> 00:36:37,400
we might be able to
track down the lab?

483
00:36:37,424 --> 00:36:39,603
Yes. But we don't.

484
00:36:40,872 --> 00:36:43,387
- What if we did?
- What do you mean?

485
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:45,858
I mean...

486
00:36:46,624 --> 00:36:48,835
- Life's funny...
- Oh, my God.

487
00:36:48,851 --> 00:36:50,944
- You didn't destroy the suit.
- What?!

488
00:36:50,968 --> 00:36:54,804
Well, it was your life's work, Hank.
I couldn't destroy that.

489
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:58,855
Before I turned myself in, I shrunk
it down and mailed it to Luis.

490
00:36:58,913 --> 00:37:01,113
You sent my suit
through the mail?

491
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:04,074
Hey, the postal service is
very reliable, you know?

492
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:06,700
They do tracking numbers now.
Like UPS.

493
00:37:06,716 --> 00:37:07,831
Where is it?

494
00:37:07,856 --> 00:37:10,449
It's in a very safe place, alright?
Don't worry.

495
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:13,269
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.

496
00:37:13,294 --> 00:37:14,973
What do you mean it's not there?
Where could it be?

497
00:37:14,998 --> 00:37:16,590
I've looked everywhere.
It's not here.

498
00:37:16,607 --> 00:37:17,966
Hey. Get away from the table.

499
00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:20,482
I put it back out
to Cassie, and I...

500
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:22,419
Show and tell.

501
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:23,908
Scotty?

502
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,747
Well, the good news is,
I know where it is.

503
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:39,351
Whenever you go back to school, isn't
everything supposed to look so much smaller?

504
00:37:39,376 --> 00:37:41,188
This place seems huge. Ah!

505
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,329
- What is it?
- It's the new regulator.

506
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,110
Hank, what's going
on with this suit?

507
00:37:45,141 --> 00:37:47,453
How much of a work
in progress is this?

508
00:37:48,235 --> 00:37:51,617
Uh-oh. Oh, no.
No, no, no.

509
00:38:03,734 --> 00:38:05,960
What, are you laughing?
Please, can you just...

510
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:07,242
Okay. Okay.

511
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:12,216
What do you see?

512
00:38:12,232 --> 00:38:14,286
The sizing coils are
malfunctioning.

513
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,443
Just let me...

514
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,021
Oww!

515
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,200
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

516
00:38:23,115 --> 00:38:24,169
Okay.

517
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:26,060
All right.

518
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:28,060
Try it now.

519
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:32,511
So...

520
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Awesome.

521
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:41,858
If only Cap could see you now.

522
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,100
Hilarious. What are we gonna do?

523
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,738
Hey!

524
00:38:56,091 --> 00:38:57,996
Where's your hall pass?

525
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:01,692
Hey, I'm talking to you.

526
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:03,778
Hey!

527
00:39:05,044 --> 00:39:06,184
Hey...

528
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:35,164
You can do it. You
almost got it!

529
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:49,165
Oh, Peanut.

530
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,563
Okay. Let's go.

531
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:21,111
Hiya, Champ! How
was school today?

532
00:40:21,181 --> 00:40:23,977
Hahaha. Alright, get
your jokes out now.

533
00:40:24,002 --> 00:40:26,516
- Can you fix the suit?
- He's so cranky.

534
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:29,481
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

535
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:31,919
Do you really have that?

536
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:43,370
Let's see if Foster was right.

537
00:40:55,761 --> 00:40:58,026
This has got to be the lab.

538
00:41:01,495 --> 00:41:04,034
- Let's go get it.
- Yeah.

539
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,513
This seems right.

540
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,037
Look at us. Teaming
up twice in one day.

541
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:20,669
Makes you think, huh?

542
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:23,318
- About what?
- Germany?

543
00:41:23,646 --> 00:41:26,505
- What do you mean?
- We were working together.

544
00:41:26,545 --> 00:41:30,333
Training together. And,
other stuff-ing together.

545
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,717
If I'd have asked you,
would you have come?

546
00:41:32,764 --> 00:41:36,014
I guess we'll never know.
But I do know one thing.

547
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:36,998
What?

548
00:41:37,014 --> 00:41:40,022
If I had, you'd have
never been caught.

549
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,171
Hey, Scott.

550
00:41:49,288 --> 00:41:53,233
You think you can stop daydreaming about
my daughter long enough to get my lab?

551
00:41:53,242 --> 00:41:55,515
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

552
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:02,619
Okay. You're transmitting.

553
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:04,057
What took you so long?

554
00:42:04,073 --> 00:42:06,048
Sorry, I had to come up
with a name for my ant.

555
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:09,291
I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

556
00:42:09,448 --> 00:42:11,362
- Like it?
- Hilarious.

557
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:16,713
I'm not getting anything on the monitors.
There's some kind of electronic disturbance.

558
00:42:16,738 --> 00:42:18,556
- Be careful.
- You know me, Hank.

559
00:42:18,581 --> 00:42:20,666
I'm always care--- Whoa!

560
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,041
- It's okay. It's just a suit.
- How do you know?

561
00:42:23,058 --> 00:42:24,195
Look.

562
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,078
That's Ghost?

563
00:42:29,202 --> 00:42:30,623
What is she doing?

564
00:42:30,663 --> 00:42:33,569
You think that suit is how she
goes through walls and stuff?

565
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:35,521
Let's just get out of
here before she wakes up.

566
00:42:35,546 --> 00:42:38,616
Hope, look. There's the lab.

567
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:46,864
We're sure this is our shrunken building
and not somebody else's, right?

568
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:49,278
Just take it, Scott.
We gotta be fast.

569
00:42:50,388 --> 00:42:51,661
I'll get it.

570
00:42:52,255 --> 00:42:53,997
Oh, sh...

571
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:07,877
Hope.

572
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:09,284
Hank.

573
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:10,737
Guys?

574
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,456
I don't think they can hear you.

575
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:17,230
Hi.

576
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:19,400
I'm Ava.

577
00:43:19,768 --> 00:43:21,048
Scott.

578
00:43:21,322 --> 00:43:22,564
So...

579
00:43:23,405 --> 00:43:26,561
You don't need a suit to, uhh...
You know.

580
00:43:27,132 --> 00:43:29,108
Go through things.

581
00:43:29,522 --> 00:43:30,522
No.

582
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:34,905
It just helps me control it.

583
00:43:36,068 --> 00:43:39,514
And the pain. Supposedly.

584
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,765
You're not gonna reach into my
chest and crush my heart, are you?

585
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:52,729
You're funny.

586
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:58,471
I'm not gonna hurt you
Scott, unless I have to.

587
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:02,292
I need...

588
00:44:03,906 --> 00:44:05,773
What's in your head.

589
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:23,077
Let's wake up the rest of the gang
and get this over with, shall we?

590
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:28,327
Get up! Come on!

591
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:32,757
Dad?

592
00:44:34,398 --> 00:44:36,335
Don't ever touch him again.

593
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:38,241
Now, now, Hope...

594
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:42,202
I think I'm being rather gentle with
your Father, all things considered.

595
00:44:42,851 --> 00:44:45,109
What the hell are
you talking about?

596
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:48,341
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.

597
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,356
Bill.

598
00:44:52,622 --> 00:44:54,364
What have you done?

599
00:44:54,497 --> 00:44:57,481
It's what you've done, Dr. Pym.

600
00:44:57,591 --> 00:44:59,075
You with her?

601
00:44:59,138 --> 00:45:01,575
Aw, man. I thought
you were cool.

602
00:45:01,654 --> 00:45:03,380
What the hell is going on here?

603
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:08,497
I doubt Hank have ever mentioned my Father.
Why would he?

604
00:45:08,646 --> 00:45:10,856
Elihas Starr.

605
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:13,669
They were colleagues at SHIELD.

606
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:15,917
Quantum research.

607
00:45:16,136 --> 00:45:20,534
Until my Father dared to disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

608
00:45:20,558 --> 00:45:25,292
You had him fired. Oh, and
discredited for good measure.

609
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:32,064
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

610
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:36,734
Desperate to restore his
name, so he took risks.

611
00:45:36,813 --> 00:45:37,813
No!

612
00:45:38,172 --> 00:45:39,906
Too many.

613
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:42,739
Until something went wrong.

614
00:45:43,234 --> 00:45:44,820
He told us to run.

615
00:45:44,965 --> 00:45:47,654
- Elihas, what's happening?
- Just go. Go!

616
00:45:47,724 --> 00:45:48,803
Daddy!

617
00:45:49,255 --> 00:45:51,841
I can tell he was scared.

618
00:45:56,914 --> 00:45:58,929
- Daddy!
- Ava, no!

619
00:46:02,008 --> 00:46:04,546
I didn't want him to be alone.

620
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:07,718
No! No!

621
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,891
When I woke up, my
parents were dead.

622
00:46:19,399 --> 00:46:21,203
I wasn't so lucky.

623
00:46:26,222 --> 00:46:29,768
They call it "Molecular
Disequilibrium."

624
00:46:30,011 --> 00:46:32,075
A rather dull name, I think.

625
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,162
Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.

626
00:46:35,475 --> 00:46:41,490
Every cell, in my body, is torn
apart and stitched back together.

627
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,755
Over, and over, everyday.

628
00:46:46,857 --> 00:46:49,372
I was still at SHIELD
when I got the call about a

629
00:46:49,396 --> 00:46:52,317
"quantum anomaly" in Argentina.

630
00:46:54,877 --> 00:46:56,557
Hello, Ava.

631
00:46:57,002 --> 00:46:58,986
My name is Bill.

632
00:46:59,213 --> 00:47:01,705
I was a friend of your Father's.

633
00:47:02,795 --> 00:47:05,013
I brought you something.

634
00:47:08,654 --> 00:47:11,200
It's all right. Try again.

635
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:13,794
That's it.

636
00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:16,950
Dr. Foster did his
best to keep me safe.

637
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:21,793
But others at SHIELD saw an
opportunity in my affliction.

638
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:28,848
They built me a containment suit
so I can control my phasing.

639
00:47:29,161 --> 00:47:31,981
And trained me to be
a stealth operative.

640
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,106
They weaponized me.

641
00:47:34,371 --> 00:47:37,206
I stole for them,
spied for them...

642
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:39,567
I killed for them.

643
00:47:39,919 --> 00:47:42,075
And in exchange for my soul,

644
00:47:42,107 --> 00:47:44,489
they were going to cure me.

645
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:48,575
They lied.

646
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,661
When SHIELD collapsed,
I took Ava in.

647
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,639
I built the chamber to slow
her decay, but her condition

648
00:47:55,663 --> 00:47:58,137
was progressive. I didn't
know how to cure her.

649
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:01,629
She wanted to kill you, Hank.
But I told her, no.

650
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,847
And that she should watch you instead.
And sure enough,

651
00:48:03,871 --> 00:48:06,910
she discovered that you
were building a tunnel.

652
00:48:08,067 --> 00:48:10,137
Then she told me about Lang.

653
00:48:10,183 --> 00:48:14,352
And the message from
Janet inside his head...

654
00:48:14,377 --> 00:48:16,603
- For Christ's sake!
- That's me. I'm sorry.

655
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,017
Look, can you tell
me who's texting me?

656
00:48:19,457 --> 00:48:21,400
Cassie. 911.

657
00:48:21,425 --> 00:48:23,605
That's my daughter. I
need to text her back.

658
00:48:23,657 --> 00:48:24,893
No. That's not happening.

659
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:26,753
It's 911. That means
it's an emergency!

660
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,691
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

661
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,423
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

662
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:34,837
Okay, well, she's trying to videochat
me now. Something might be wrong.

663
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:36,822
Let me talk to her. Please!

664
00:48:38,884 --> 00:48:40,877
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

665
00:48:40,983 --> 00:48:43,662
- I can't find my soccer shoes.
- What?

666
00:48:43,686 --> 00:48:45,084
I have a game tomorrow.

667
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:46,415
Hey, Scott, I know
that they're there.

668
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,747
Can you just walk the
phone around the house?

669
00:48:47,772 --> 00:48:50,397
- No, I can't do that right now.
- Why not?

670
00:48:50,413 --> 00:48:51,326
Because I'm sick.

671
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:55,146
Hey, can you just maybe look around later
then call me back? Please? Thank you.

672
00:48:55,155 --> 00:48:57,373
- Bye, Daddy!
- Bye, Peanut!

673
00:48:57,397 --> 00:48:59,857
- Feel better!
- Feel better, buddy!

674
00:48:59,998 --> 00:49:02,553
I'm sorry. It's
that emergency.

675
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:04,435
Ava, I wanna help you.

676
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:06,521
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

677
00:49:06,546 --> 00:49:09,000
- Oh, really? How?
- Janet.

678
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:11,984
For the last 30 years, she's been
down there absorbing quantum energy.

679
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:15,803
We can extract that energy. We can use it
to repair Ava's molecular structure...

680
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:16,995
- Extract it?
- Yes!

681
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:19,353
Are you insane? That
would rip Janet apart!

682
00:49:19,378 --> 00:49:23,058
You don't know that. I'm
gonna fire up your tunnel.

683
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:25,665
When Janet's location pops into Lang's
head, he's gonna give it to me,

684
00:49:25,691 --> 00:49:28,620
- or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI.
- What?

685
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:32,612
You're gonna stay here just
in case I need your help.

686
00:49:33,546 --> 00:49:36,155
- Like hell, I would help you!
- You'll do whatever I say.

687
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:39,279
- You're gonna kill Janet.
- I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank.

688
00:49:39,304 --> 00:49:41,749
Goddammit, Bill!

689
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:44,382
- Dad?
- Calm down, Hank.

690
00:49:44,421 --> 00:49:46,593
So help me, God...

691
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:49,889
It's his heart! He needs
his pills, please.

692
00:49:49,921 --> 00:49:52,639
Dr. Foster, they're
in the tin, please.

693
00:49:53,335 --> 00:49:56,100
He could die! For... come on!

694
00:49:56,256 --> 00:49:57,451
Help him!

695
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,271
Dad, just hang on, alright?
Just keep breathing. Stay calm.

696
00:50:00,295 --> 00:50:03,779
- Help him, man! Come on!
- The Altoid tin!

697
00:50:05,492 --> 00:50:06,787
Wait!

698
00:50:10,445 --> 00:50:12,046
Thanks, guys!

699
00:50:12,062 --> 00:50:13,640
Hank!

700
00:50:25,014 --> 00:50:27,748
Bill is filling that
girl's head with lies.

701
00:50:27,773 --> 00:50:31,054
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

702
00:50:31,122 --> 00:50:33,489
Now, bring her down.
Right, lock it in.

703
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:36,379
No, no, no. The bolt
is on the other side.

704
00:50:36,395 --> 00:50:39,215
Tighten that one down, then
bring her down with one knock.

705
00:50:39,364 --> 00:50:41,676
- Good job.
- It'll work.

706
00:50:41,731 --> 00:50:44,012
Foster, he could've fried
the entire system.

707
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,075
Look, we'll adjust the relays while you
go reprogram the settings. All right?

708
00:50:47,088 --> 00:50:48,744
It's gonna be fine.

709
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,775
- So, this is it.
- Yeah.

710
00:50:56,838 --> 00:50:59,377
You'd think with all this time
to prepare, I'd be more ready.

711
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:02,416
Well, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

712
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:05,252
It kind of, melts your mind.

713
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:08,174
- I mean, seeing my Mom again.
- Oh.

714
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:12,439
What if she's a completely
different person?

715
00:51:12,456 --> 00:51:15,017
Yeah, like George Washington?

716
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:19,244
- I'm serious, Scott.
- Or, George Jefferson?

717
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,220
What if she's
forgotten about me?

718
00:51:23,885 --> 00:51:25,955
When I was in prison...

719
00:51:25,986 --> 00:51:28,462
The only thing that got
me through was Cassie.

720
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:32,173
I could've been locked up for 100 years.
I never would've forgotten her.

721
00:51:33,497 --> 00:51:37,388
I know your Mom is counting the
minutes until she can see you again.

722
00:51:39,365 --> 00:51:40,771
Thank you.

723
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:50,305
- Hey.
- We've got a big problem.

724
00:51:50,384 --> 00:51:53,157
You forgot the motion sensor lights
on the back of the building.

725
00:51:53,182 --> 00:51:53,766
No.

726
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:57,409
They're on the proposal, and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.

727
00:51:57,434 --> 00:52:00,822
Uh, yeah. Look, it's
been a little crazy...

728
00:52:01,832 --> 00:52:03,543
Look, maybe I can stop by
tomorrow and take a look at it.

729
00:52:03,575 --> 00:52:04,609
No, no, no, no!

730
00:52:04,634 --> 00:52:07,240
The meeting is first thing in the morning.
You gotta come right now and fix it.

731
00:52:07,265 --> 00:52:09,772
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

732
00:52:09,781 --> 00:52:12,358
You know what, I'm coming to you.
I'll just explain the plans, and

733
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:14,827
get it on the laptop, and
you can fix them in.

734
00:52:14,976 --> 00:52:17,194
- Just tell me where you are, okay?
- It's complicated.

735
00:52:17,226 --> 00:52:19,640
What do you mean,
it's complicated?

736
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:24,554
As you can see, sir...

737
00:52:24,593 --> 00:52:27,053
This system is state-of-the-art.

738
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:29,257
Security of tomorrow... today!

739
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:32,327
Oh, that's so good! I love the
lead-in, Bro. Keep practicing.

740
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:34,601
Hey, I just gotta drive on to
Scotty's, so he can fix the plans.

741
00:52:34,632 --> 00:52:36,311
But don't worry. I'll be
back in plenty of time.

742
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:37,166
As you can see, sir...

743
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:38,728
Oh! Oh! Oh!

744
00:52:39,402 --> 00:52:40,925
Tell me you got the van
washed for tomorrow morning.

745
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:42,611
Down to the undercarriage, baby.

746
00:52:42,636 --> 00:52:45,551
- You sprung for the undercarriage wash?
- Well, you said get the works.

747
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:47,814
That's a scam, Bro. We live in
California, not Minnesota!

748
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,174
He's right.

749
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,715
The undercarriage wash.

750
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:53,651
That's for cleaning
off road salt.

751
00:52:53,688 --> 00:52:56,602
Laid out in all those
snow-laden sister states.

752
00:52:56,665 --> 00:52:59,492
Who are you and why do you know
so much about car wash protocol?

753
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:02,086
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

754
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:04,586
And I do my research, Luis.

755
00:53:05,899 --> 00:53:09,295
To wit, I have learned,
from a friend of mine,

756
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,976
at the FBI, that you're a
known associate of Scott Lang.

757
00:53:13,002 --> 00:53:16,095
A known associate of Hank Pym.
Who I've also learned,

758
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:20,949
has a portable frickin' laboratory.
Filled with all kinds of juicy tech.

759
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:23,738
And you're gonna
tell me where it is.

760
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:27,712
Well, I hate to break it to you, but I
don't know what you're talking about.

761
00:53:28,761 --> 00:53:30,837
Well, I sense a
resistance in you, Luis.

762
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,142
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

763
00:53:34,384 --> 00:53:38,587
So, I'm gonna introduce you,
to my good friend Uzman.

764
00:53:38,892 --> 00:53:42,173
Now, Uzman, is a master

765
00:53:42,251 --> 00:53:46,844
at extracting information from the
unwillin' through psychoactive means.

766
00:53:48,216 --> 00:53:50,059
Oh, is that truth serum?

767
00:53:50,216 --> 00:53:52,301
There's no such thing
as truth serum.

768
00:53:52,326 --> 00:53:54,326
That's just nonsense from TV.

769
00:53:54,381 --> 00:53:57,044
- What is it, then?
- It's a little concoction,

770
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,186
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the SIS.

771
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:03,224
It makes you suggestible.
And highly responsive.

772
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,185
- Dude, that's truth serum!
- No, it's not.

773
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:06,839
No fencing, but,

774
00:54:06,902 --> 00:54:08,854
- this sound like truth serum to me.
- Right?!

775
00:54:08,901 --> 00:54:12,158
- It's not a truth serum.
- Oh, okay. Hey, I believe you.

776
00:54:12,198 --> 00:54:13,650
It's not a truth serum.

777
00:54:13,675 --> 00:54:16,862
If it walk like duck,
and talk like ducks...

778
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:18,112
It's truth serum.

779
00:54:18,144 --> 00:54:20,400
Well, I have a lot of allergies.
So...

780
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:22,760
You might wanna
think about that.

781
00:54:24,909 --> 00:54:27,300
Time to get that lab back.

782
00:54:27,855 --> 00:54:28,885
What?

783
00:54:29,722 --> 00:54:33,018
The chamber and the suit are
barely helping anymore.

784
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,221
How long have I got?

785
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:40,938
A couple of weeks, maybe.

786
00:54:42,665 --> 00:54:45,078
Well then, we'll make
them bring the lab back.

787
00:54:45,103 --> 00:54:46,204
How?

788
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:49,556
Lang. He has a daughter, right?

789
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:51,993
You can't mean that. Ava?

790
00:54:54,116 --> 00:54:56,231
I tolerate a lot of the
things you do out there,

791
00:54:56,256 --> 00:54:58,616
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.

792
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,685
You're not the one who's about
to fade away into nothing, Bill.

793
00:55:01,724 --> 00:55:02,998
I am!

794
00:55:03,263 --> 00:55:05,591
You said you could fix me.

795
00:55:08,101 --> 00:55:09,522
You promised!

796
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:11,991
I know. I will.

797
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,819
But not like that.

798
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,155
You let one finger on
that little girl...

799
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:21,311
I won't help you.
And we're done.

800
00:55:26,471 --> 00:55:27,658
Fine.

801
00:55:29,112 --> 00:55:31,736
There are other options.

802
00:55:44,866 --> 00:55:47,241
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

803
00:55:47,257 --> 00:55:48,474
'Cause I don't feel anything.

804
00:55:48,499 --> 00:55:50,499
That was a lie. I
did feel something.

805
00:55:50,624 --> 00:55:52,678
- This is truth serum!
- There's no such thing.

806
00:55:52,703 --> 00:55:54,038
Okay!

807
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,327
Okay, okay.

808
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:59,242
Now I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

809
00:55:59,258 --> 00:56:00,421
Okay.

810
00:56:02,703 --> 00:56:03,890
Where...

811
00:56:04,452 --> 00:56:06,046
is Scott Lang?

812
00:56:06,184 --> 00:56:09,537
Well, see, that's complicated. 'Cause when
I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place.

813
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:12,448
And I'm not talking about cell block D.
His wife had just filed for divorce.

814
00:56:12,473 --> 00:56:14,793
And I was like, "Damn, homie, she
dumped you while you were in lock-up?"

815
00:56:14,822 --> 00:56:16,909
And he's like, "Yeah, I know. I thought
I was gonna be with her forever,

816
00:56:16,934 --> 00:56:17,934
but now, I'm all alone!"

817
00:56:17,947 --> 00:56:20,563
And I was like, "Damn, homie, you gotta
chin up. 'Cause you'll find a new partner.

818
00:56:20,588 --> 00:56:21,931
But you know what? I'm Luis."

819
00:56:21,947 --> 00:56:24,353
And he says, "You know what? I'm Scotty.
And we're gonna be best friends."

820
00:56:24,378 --> 00:56:25,400
Wait, hold on, hold on.

821
00:56:25,441 --> 00:56:29,307
Now I like a good story as much as the next person,
but what's this have to do with where Scott Lang is?

822
00:56:29,331 --> 00:56:30,605
I'm getting there,
I'm getting there.

823
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,401
You put a dime in him, you got
to let the whole song play out.

824
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:35,278
He hit like human jukebox.

825
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:37,269
Oh! My abuelita had a
jukebox in a restaurant.

826
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:39,301
Yeah. Only played Morrissey.

827
00:56:39,357 --> 00:56:42,364
And if anybody ever complained,
she'd be like, "Oh, porque? Gusta mas?"

828
00:56:42,373 --> 00:56:44,632
And El Chicanos, we call
them mas, "then, adios!"

829
00:56:44,657 --> 00:56:47,813
What can I say? We relate to these
melancholy bandits, you know?

830
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:49,399
- Lang.
- Right, right, right, right.

831
00:56:49,415 --> 00:56:51,244
So anyway, this guy gets out of
jail and starts working for Hank.

832
00:56:51,269 --> 00:56:53,266
And that's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all like,

833
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:55,742
"I want nothing to do with you. Look
at my hairdo. I'm all business."

834
00:56:55,767 --> 00:56:56,790
And then Scotty's like,

835
00:56:56,806 --> 00:56:59,657
"You know what, girl? My heart's all broken,
and I'll probably never find love again.

836
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:00,736
But damn, if I
want to kiss you!"

837
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:02,898
But then you fast-forward and they're
all like into each other, right?

838
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:05,281
And then Scotty's like, "You know
what, I can't tell you this,

839
00:57:05,304 --> 00:57:07,148
but I'm gonna go trashing the
airport with Captain America!"

840
00:57:07,163 --> 00:57:10,343
Then she said, "I can't believe you split
like that! Smell you later, dummy!"

841
00:57:10,368 --> 00:57:13,638
So Scotty goes on house arrest, and he
won't admit it, but his heart's all like,

842
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:16,804
"Damn! I thought Hope could've been
my new true partner. But I blew it!"

843
00:57:16,829 --> 00:57:19,368
But fate brought them back together,
and then Hope's heart is all,

844
00:57:19,392 --> 00:57:22,525
"I'm worried that I can't trust him. And he's
gonna screw up again and ruin everything."

845
00:57:22,532 --> 00:57:24,242
And in my heart, it's all like,

846
00:57:24,259 --> 00:57:27,991
"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company's rent.
And we're days away from going out of business! Oooh!"

847
00:57:28,016 --> 00:57:29,851
- Out of business?
- Days away?!

848
00:57:29,891 --> 00:57:32,469
Damn truth serum! I was
trying to protect you guys.

849
00:57:32,477 --> 00:57:35,305
I swear to God. I was trying to
be a good boss. But we're broke.

850
00:57:35,336 --> 00:57:37,539
And the Karapetyans are our last hope,
and if we don't show up, we're done!

851
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:39,328
- That's terrible bossing.
- Damn, Bro!

852
00:57:39,336 --> 00:57:41,437
- That's on me. That's on me!
- Hey!

853
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:43,241
Enough.

854
00:57:46,038 --> 00:57:48,305
I'm gonna ask you
one more time...

855
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,419
Where is Scott Lang?

856
00:57:50,444 --> 00:57:52,311
I've been trying to tell you. He's in
a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.

857
00:57:52,327 --> 00:57:53,967
Emotionally speaking.

858
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:57,294
But where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking?!

859
00:57:57,319 --> 00:57:58,748
Oh! The woods.

860
00:57:58,795 --> 00:58:00,240
The woods?

861
00:58:00,326 --> 00:58:01,755
Baba Yaga!

862
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:04,303
What do you mean, the woods?

863
00:58:04,342 --> 00:58:07,138
The Muir woods!

864
00:58:07,155 --> 00:58:08,655
For God's sake!

865
00:58:09,717 --> 00:58:14,412
Baba Yaga, coming late, little
children, sleep at eight.

866
00:58:17,477 --> 00:58:19,010
Damn it!

867
00:58:19,985 --> 00:58:22,734
If that freak gets Pym's tech,
I'm never gonna see it.

868
00:58:23,422 --> 00:58:25,008
So what do we do now?

869
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:28,742
It's easier to steal it from the
feds than from a boogeyman.

870
00:58:30,977 --> 00:58:32,297
Hey. It's me.

871
00:58:32,313 --> 00:58:34,078
How'd you like to
get a promotion?

872
00:58:34,282 --> 00:58:37,867
I've got the location on
Pym, Van Dyne, and Lang.

873
00:58:38,078 --> 00:58:41,047
But you're gonna have to take them down now,
'cause they ain't gonna be there for long.

874
00:58:41,345 --> 00:58:43,852
And when you do, you're
gonna get me that lab.

875
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:45,485
Understood.

876
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:48,759
Good news, gentlemen.

877
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:51,317
Feds are gonna do the
hard work for us.

878
00:58:51,692 --> 00:58:54,106
What are you looking at?
Change my tire!

879
00:58:56,177 --> 00:58:57,301
Sir...

880
00:58:57,607 --> 00:58:59,294
Can you knock?

881
00:58:59,716 --> 00:59:02,505
Sorry, sir. But I
just got a lead.

882
00:59:03,318 --> 00:59:05,434
Ooh. I love leads.

883
00:59:12,096 --> 00:59:15,096
- Systems in the green.
- Priming the coils.

884
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:18,666
Full charge.

885
00:59:18,807 --> 00:59:21,885
Soon as the tunnel's open, let us know if you
get anything that could be part of her message.

886
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:23,424
Yeah, yeah. I will.

887
00:59:25,245 --> 00:59:26,721
Okay, then.

888
00:59:29,659 --> 00:59:31,666
Here it goes.

889
00:59:44,637 --> 00:59:46,222
We did it!

890
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:48,933
You got anything?

891
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:52,621
Nothing.

892
00:59:52,996 --> 00:59:55,652
Just give it a minute.
Because it could...

893
00:59:58,082 --> 00:59:59,715
No. No, no, no!

894
00:59:59,785 --> 01:00:02,433
- What's happening?
- It's shutting down. Maybe vectors are off.

895
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:04,700
We've gone over them a million times.
I know they're right.

896
01:00:04,716 --> 01:00:07,434
- Well then, what else could it be?
- I don't know.

897
01:00:13,804 --> 01:00:15,530
- Scott, what are you doing?
- Scott, get away from that!

898
01:00:15,554 --> 01:00:16,522
Scott, we had...

899
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:20,139
I'm sorry. I don't know how much time
I have. I need to fix the algorithm.

900
01:00:21,624 --> 01:00:24,006
Trust me, after 30
years down here...

901
01:00:24,164 --> 01:00:26,452
I've thought about it a lot.

902
01:00:30,391 --> 01:00:31,695
Janet?

903
01:00:34,203 --> 01:00:35,805
Hi, Hon.

904
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:40,893
Hello, Jellybean.

905
01:00:41,144 --> 01:00:42,339
Mom?

906
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:46,932
It's not the reunion I had
imagined. It's all so rushed.

907
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,237
You two have done
such great work.

908
01:00:49,284 --> 01:00:51,690
You just need
a little...

909
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,690
nudge.

910
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:10,471
Janet, how is
this possible?

911
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:15,604
It wasn't a message you put in
Scott's head. It was an antenna.

912
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,440
Clever girl.

913
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:19,447
I'm so proud of you.

914
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:23,072
Honey, tell us where you are.
Tell us how to find you.

915
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:26,799
No, the probability fields are too complex.
That's why I needed to talk to you.

916
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:28,861
You have to
follow my voice.

917
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:31,886
- Of course.
- Like tracing a call back to its source.

918
01:01:36,146 --> 01:01:39,740
I'm tracking your signal using
subatomic frequencies,

919
01:01:39,795 --> 01:01:42,201
between point
2 and point 9.

920
01:01:42,226 --> 01:01:45,031
- I've narrowed it to 4 and 6.
- It's too tight. We could miss you.

921
01:01:45,056 --> 01:01:47,827
Look at us squabbling again.

922
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,766
Fine. Between 3 and 7.

923
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:54,460
Our first fight in decades
and it's over just like that.

924
01:02:09,636 --> 01:02:11,042
Bull's eye.

925
01:02:11,089 --> 01:02:13,729
- Source lock.
- It's you!

926
01:02:13,808 --> 01:02:16,159
Ha! We got it!

927
01:02:16,495 --> 01:02:18,753
You have to meet me in
these exact coordinates.

928
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:21,316
In the wasteland, beyond
the quantum void.

929
01:02:21,379 --> 01:02:24,814
It's very dangerous, especially on
the human mind. So be careful.

930
01:02:24,884 --> 01:02:27,602
Time and space work
very differently down here.

931
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:30,468
You have two hours. After that,
the probability fields will shift,

932
01:02:30,493 --> 01:02:33,500
and it'll be another century
before they'll align like this again.

933
01:02:33,574 --> 01:02:35,664
We'll find you.

934
01:02:42,115 --> 01:02:44,404
I know you
will, Jellybean.

935
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:50,021
Nope.

936
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,929
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

937
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:57,804
How did we get up here?

938
01:03:02,234 --> 01:03:04,990
At first, you'll see all kinds of lights,
and it's gonna get really trippy

939
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:08,038
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Like, really silent.

940
01:03:08,062 --> 01:03:09,515
Scott, I'll be fine.

941
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,727
- I'm just saying. Cause I've been down there.
- Yeah, so you've mentioned.

942
01:03:15,735 --> 01:03:18,540
Um, sorry. I have
to take this.

943
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:20,321
Hey, man. You coming?

944
01:03:20,337 --> 01:03:22,282
No, I'm not. But you
know what? Ghost is.

945
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,524
And you know what? The
feds, they know where you are.

946
01:03:24,563 --> 01:03:26,047
- What?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

947
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:29,188
They gave me some truth serum, then all
of a sudden I started talking all honestly,

948
01:03:29,204 --> 01:03:32,680
like, I hate the way that you
use the dishwasher. I hate it.

949
01:03:32,836 --> 01:03:35,250
But you need to go home because
the feds are probably going there now!

950
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:38,133
And by the way, who puts the
plates on the top rack, okay?

951
01:03:38,157 --> 01:03:39,867
They don't go there!

952
01:03:48,184 --> 01:03:49,691
I feel like
such a jerk.

953
01:03:49,723 --> 01:03:52,941
You're gonna be really
mad. We gotta go.

954
01:03:52,981 --> 01:03:54,848
- What?
- Ghost knows where we are.

955
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,770
- So does the FBI.
- How?

956
01:03:56,802 --> 01:03:58,911
- I told Luis where we are.
- You what?

957
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:01,412
I told him to come here, so I can help
him with the Karapetyan proposal.

958
01:04:01,428 --> 01:04:02,607
Oh, my God!

959
01:04:02,655 --> 01:04:06,146
But... Look, we need to land that account.
Otherwise, we'll lose the business!

960
01:04:06,162 --> 01:04:08,152
Do you know how hard it is for ex-
cons to find work these days?

961
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,232
Jesus, Scott!

962
01:04:19,245 --> 01:04:20,948
90 seconds to
close the aperture.

963
01:04:20,973 --> 01:04:23,560
- You have to depolarize the coils first.
- I know.

964
01:04:23,585 --> 01:04:25,780
I'm really sorry, but the...

965
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:28,577
FBI is coming
to my place, so...

966
01:04:28,773 --> 01:04:30,757
I have to go.

967
01:04:32,248 --> 01:04:34,294
Can I borrow the suit?

968
01:04:36,842 --> 01:04:40,263
Look, uhh... I'm just
gonna borrow the suit.

969
01:04:41,146 --> 01:04:42,896
I'll come back. Just
tell me where you'll be.

970
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,372
- Don't bother.
- What?

971
01:04:44,404 --> 01:04:46,943
We'll come and get the suit from
you as soon as we find my Mom.

972
01:04:46,974 --> 01:04:49,731
- Hope...
- Scott, just go!

973
01:05:06,788 --> 01:05:08,631
- Scott?
- Daddy?

974
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:12,287
- It's us, buddy!
- We're here for Cassie's shoes.

975
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:13,717
He must be resting.

976
01:05:13,733 --> 01:05:16,153
Honey, why don't you go up the
stairs and go look under your bed.

977
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:19,146
Daddy? You upstairs?

978
01:05:19,342 --> 01:05:20,982
Daddy...

979
01:05:21,905 --> 01:05:24,052
What the?

980
01:05:24,516 --> 01:05:27,790
Really lives like
a pig these days.

981
01:05:30,173 --> 01:05:31,516
Daddy?

982
01:05:38,871 --> 01:05:40,902
Spread out!

983
01:05:41,129 --> 01:05:43,706
- Again?
- You people have no shame!

984
01:05:43,754 --> 01:05:47,129
- The monitor says that he's in the bathroom.
- Yeah. I'm not buying it.

985
01:05:49,301 --> 01:05:51,269
Cassie, let
the man get by.

986
01:05:51,294 --> 01:05:53,721
- But Daddy's super sick!
- I'll see about that.

987
01:05:53,746 --> 01:05:55,738
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick.

988
01:05:55,763 --> 01:05:57,903
Well, I'll take my
chances, sweetie.

989
01:05:57,927 --> 01:06:00,216
He barfed. Like, a lot.

990
01:06:00,232 --> 01:06:03,880
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.
I've seen worse things than vomit.

991
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:06,598
- Like, a lot, a lot?
- Yes!

992
01:06:06,653 --> 01:06:09,145
- Forget it. Move aside.
- No!

993
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:15,321
Woo!

994
01:06:15,696 --> 01:06:18,547
- What are you doing here?
- Scott.

995
01:06:19,297 --> 01:06:22,422
I'm sorry. I'm just really sick.

996
01:06:22,586 --> 01:06:24,086
I told you.

997
01:06:24,406 --> 01:06:27,570
Excuse me. Sometimes you
just gotta get it out, you know?

998
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:29,165
Sorry.

999
01:06:35,698 --> 01:06:39,456
I'll start the van.
You get the lab.

1000
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,228
Freeze! You're surrounded!

1001
01:06:58,106 --> 01:07:03,255
Hank Pym. Hope Van Dyne.
You're under arrest.

1002
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:06,660
- This is harassment.
- Actually, it's not.

1003
01:07:06,762 --> 01:07:10,754
What does the FBI even stand for?
Forever Bothering Individuals?

1004
01:07:12,176 --> 01:07:14,972
- His monitor check out?
- Of course, it does.

1005
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:18,363
Damn it. It's like I just got
fed a bowl of malarkey.

1006
01:07:19,012 --> 01:07:21,558
We got them, sir. Pym and
Van Dyne are in custody.

1007
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:24,074
Seriously? Yes!

1008
01:07:24,879 --> 01:07:28,839
Oh. Sorry, Scott. They were
your friends. That's insensitive.

1009
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,581
I just really needed a
win, you know? Anyway...

1010
01:07:31,613 --> 01:07:35,903
I'll be back later for the official end of your
sentence. Sorry for misjudging you, pal.

1011
01:07:35,928 --> 01:07:38,631
You should feel
great about yourself.

1012
01:08:01,715 --> 01:08:02,592
What is it?

1013
01:08:02,617 --> 01:08:05,575
We have a man down,
and Pym's lab is gone.

1014
01:08:13,683 --> 01:08:14,987
Hey.

1015
01:08:16,769 --> 01:08:20,003
- Thanks for covering for me.
- Sure.

1016
01:08:22,488 --> 01:08:23,488
So..

1017
01:08:24,292 --> 01:08:26,721
How long have you
been Ant-Man again?

1018
01:08:30,558 --> 01:08:31,940
Not long.

1019
01:08:32,143 --> 01:08:33,830
Things just sort
of happened.

1020
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:37,829
I'm sorry, for lying to you. I'm
sorry for risking everything.

1021
01:08:37,854 --> 01:08:40,424
- Dad, it's okay.
- That's not...

1022
01:08:41,307 --> 01:08:45,299
I do some dumb things, and the people
that I love the most pay the price.

1023
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:46,377
Mainly, you.

1024
01:08:46,402 --> 01:08:48,752
Trying to help
people isn't dumb.

1025
01:08:48,808 --> 01:08:50,050
Well...

1026
01:08:50,941 --> 01:08:53,386
I screw it up just
about every time.

1027
01:08:53,411 --> 01:08:56,581
So maybe, you just need
someone watching your back.

1028
01:08:56,652 --> 01:08:57,980
Like a partner.

1029
01:08:58,004 --> 01:09:00,573
Well, she's made it clear that's
about the last thing she wants.

1030
01:09:00,598 --> 01:09:02,886
- Who?
- Hope.

1031
01:09:05,726 --> 01:09:08,335
- What, who did you think?
- Me.

1032
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:09,773
You?

1033
01:09:09,914 --> 01:09:11,593
Don't laugh.

1034
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:15,256
- I'd be a great partner.
- Oh, Peanut!

1035
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,928
You would be awesome.

1036
01:09:18,265 --> 01:09:21,671
And if I let you, I would
be a terrible Dad.

1037
01:09:22,054 --> 01:09:23,054
Fine.

1038
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,569
Have Hope be your
partner. She's smart.

1039
01:09:28,054 --> 01:09:30,132
She reminds me of you.

1040
01:09:30,163 --> 01:09:32,397
You gonna go help her?

1041
01:09:32,492 --> 01:09:34,358
I think you should help her.

1042
01:09:34,389 --> 01:09:36,905
I wish I could, but...

1043
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:40,366
I don't know how I can help
her without hurting you.

1044
01:09:43,503 --> 01:09:47,549
You can do it. You
can do anything.

1045
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:50,854
You're the World's
Greatest Grandma.

1046
01:09:58,353 --> 01:10:00,032
Agent Woo will
see you in an hour.

1047
01:10:00,057 --> 01:10:02,328
An hour? We don't
have an hour.

1048
01:10:02,353 --> 01:10:05,235
Aww. You got somewhere
else to be?

1049
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:15,142
Now, that's my girl.

1050
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:23,409
Alright, what's our plan?

1051
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:26,464
To shrink that wall.

1052
01:10:26,628 --> 01:10:29,362
It looks load bearing.
Ceiling could collapse...

1053
01:10:29,386 --> 01:10:33,353
- Then we run like hell.
- It's made up of 15-20 agents on the floor.

1054
01:10:33,378 --> 01:10:35,370
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

1055
01:10:35,409 --> 01:10:38,229
- They're all heavily armed.
- Not great odds.

1056
01:10:38,589 --> 01:10:41,214
- You got any better ideas?
- Nope.

1057
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:43,846
But I'm not giving
up on Mom.

1058
01:10:43,984 --> 01:10:46,257
She'd be so proud of you.

1059
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,038
Okay.

1060
01:10:53,428 --> 01:10:54,428
One...

1061
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:56,560
Two...

1062
01:11:01,498 --> 01:11:02,451
Scott?

1063
01:11:02,476 --> 01:11:04,317
What are you two just
standing around for?

1064
01:11:04,342 --> 01:11:06,506
We gotta go
find that lab.

1065
01:11:06,608 --> 01:11:08,787
What about me?

1066
01:11:08,935 --> 01:11:10,231
Perfect.

1067
01:11:10,443 --> 01:11:13,505
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

1068
01:11:16,527 --> 01:11:17,902
Sir.

1069
01:11:25,632 --> 01:11:27,014
Okay. Now what?

1070
01:11:27,234 --> 01:11:29,093
You're asking me?

1071
01:11:31,195 --> 01:11:32,804
Get in!

1072
01:11:38,047 --> 01:11:39,047
Hi.

1073
01:11:39,757 --> 01:11:40,757
Hi.

1074
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:45,914
Uhh, excuse me. Are we
planning on leaving soon,

1075
01:11:45,939 --> 01:11:50,595
or are you two gonna keep staring at each
other until they start shooting at us.

1076
01:11:56,936 --> 01:11:58,364
- Hey, Burch.
- Yeah?

1077
01:11:58,389 --> 01:12:01,545
- Yeah. They're out.
- I'm on my way.

1078
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:08,280
- As soon as we see him, so was the van.
- How could this happen?

1079
01:12:08,305 --> 01:12:10,547
What the dickens?

1080
01:12:12,539 --> 01:12:14,617
Thank you.

1081
01:12:14,703 --> 01:12:16,828
You're welcome.

1082
01:12:18,023 --> 01:12:20,203
So, uhh... How do
we find the lab?

1083
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:24,601
After I lost it the first time,
I put on a new tracker...

1084
01:12:24,711 --> 01:12:27,109
...of sorts.

1085
01:12:35,354 --> 01:12:37,432
That'll work.

1086
01:13:03,443 --> 01:13:05,489
Is it ready or not?

1087
01:13:05,607 --> 01:13:08,466
We can begin the
extraction process now.

1088
01:13:09,255 --> 01:13:12,700
Listen, Ava, this whole thing
could be very dangerous.

1089
01:13:12,944 --> 01:13:16,647
- Maybe, maybe we should...
- Maybe we should what? Wait?

1090
01:13:16,999 --> 01:13:19,897
I've got days until I'm dead.

1091
01:13:20,269 --> 01:13:24,065
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

1092
01:13:26,089 --> 01:13:28,909
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

1093
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:31,690
We don't have much time before Mom's
location shifts and we lose her.

1094
01:13:31,729 --> 01:13:34,221
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before that.

1095
01:13:34,526 --> 01:13:37,657
You know, my Pap-pap always said if you
wanna do something right, you make a list.

1096
01:13:37,682 --> 01:13:39,026
So, we should do that.

1097
01:13:39,049 --> 01:13:41,330
One, we have to
break into that lab.

1098
01:13:41,362 --> 01:13:44,010
Two, we have to kick
out Foster and Ghost.

1099
01:13:44,176 --> 01:13:48,010
Three, we have to fight Ghost. That
seems like it should be part of 2.

1100
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:50,441
2-A. Right? Let's call it 2-A.

1101
01:13:50,457 --> 01:13:52,371
Fight Ghost, 2-A. Oh!

1102
01:13:52,395 --> 01:13:56,121
Also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully
grown for you to come back. Otherwise we're screwed...

1103
01:13:56,137 --> 01:13:56,761
Scott...

1104
01:13:56,777 --> 01:13:58,136
You want me to start
again? I'll start again.

1105
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,144
I'm going to dive.

1106
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:04,317
The only chance we've got is if
the 2 of you are out here

1107
01:14:04,324 --> 01:14:07,581
together, protecting the tunnel.

1108
01:14:07,703 --> 01:14:10,578
Let me do this,
Hope. Please.

1109
01:14:11,734 --> 01:14:13,812
Let me get her.

1110
01:14:15,142 --> 01:14:16,876
I think he's right.

1111
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,326
Whassup?

1112
01:14:28,913 --> 01:14:31,608
You remember that
beloved commercial?

1113
01:14:31,819 --> 01:14:33,912
Whassup?

1114
01:14:34,006 --> 01:14:35,904
I had him follow us here.

1115
01:14:35,959 --> 01:14:38,740
I thought we could
use some help.

1116
01:14:40,334 --> 01:14:43,271
All right. I'm in position.
The ants are headed in.

1117
01:14:43,311 --> 01:14:46,006
- Copy that.
- Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.

1118
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:47,959
- You want a pez?
- No.

1119
01:14:49,088 --> 01:14:50,896
Guess who gave me
this for my birthday.

1120
01:14:51,331 --> 01:14:53,729
By the way,
I love that suit!

1121
01:14:53,839 --> 01:14:55,909
Thanks, man.

1122
01:14:56,049 --> 01:14:58,314
I wish I had a suit.

1123
01:14:58,614 --> 01:15:02,449
I would even like a suit with
like minimal powers, you know?

1124
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:06,668
Or maybe, even just
a suit. With no powers.

1125
01:15:21,723 --> 01:15:23,426
What is it?

1126
01:15:23,691 --> 01:15:25,503
I don't know.

1127
01:15:29,521 --> 01:15:31,841
It's them.

1128
01:15:33,138 --> 01:15:35,794
They can't be far.

1129
01:15:55,849 --> 01:15:58,153
Hank? Hank?

1130
01:15:58,208 --> 01:15:59,661
Stop it!

1131
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,263
Dad, what's your status?

1132
01:16:02,341 --> 01:16:06,051
Foster's taken care
of. Suiting up, now.

1133
01:16:10,246 --> 01:16:12,261
I just wanted to save Ava.

1134
01:16:12,293 --> 01:16:16,332
She's facing death or something
far more terrible. She's afraid.

1135
01:16:16,606 --> 01:16:21,050
I'll help you find a cure when
I get back. I promise.

1136
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,597
Together, we'll figure
something out.

1137
01:16:26,379 --> 01:16:28,183
Good luck, Hank.

1138
01:16:28,475 --> 01:16:30,459
Thanks, Bill.

1139
01:16:30,762 --> 01:16:33,894
Now, I'm gonna need
you to step back.

1140
01:16:50,593 --> 01:16:54,062
Time remaining:
fifteen minutes.

1141
01:16:55,594 --> 01:16:57,813
Hank's in, Scott.
Any sign of her?

1142
01:16:58,017 --> 01:17:00,540
No. Nothing yet.

1143
01:17:05,258 --> 01:17:06,515
Ava!

1144
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:11,531
Call off the ants, Scott.

1145
01:17:11,555 --> 01:17:12,898
Oh, boy.

1146
01:17:36,059 --> 01:17:39,652
Can I get a status report, cause I got
some serious Ghost problems here!

1147
01:17:42,246 --> 01:17:44,105
Ready to dive.

1148
01:17:50,322 --> 01:17:53,916
- In case I don't make it...
- Don't. Don't say that.

1149
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:56,580
I can't lose you, too.

1150
01:17:56,635 --> 01:17:59,158
I love you, Hope.

1151
01:17:59,565 --> 01:18:02,931
Guys, everything's bad
over here. Please...

1152
01:18:17,884 --> 01:18:19,126
Now.

1153
01:18:28,817 --> 01:18:30,425
Misdirection.

1154
01:18:30,465 --> 01:18:34,449
One of the first things they teach you
at Online Close-up Magic University.

1155
01:18:36,496 --> 01:18:37,863
No!

1156
01:18:40,535 --> 01:18:42,449
All right. We
got it, Scotty.

1157
01:18:42,707 --> 01:18:46,160
- Meet us at the rendezvous point.
- Okay. On my way.

1158
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:47,917
Oh, no.

1159
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:51,800
Really?

1160
01:18:51,863 --> 01:18:54,433
- This guy? Again?
- Who?

1161
01:18:54,511 --> 01:18:57,495
I told you our business
wasn't over.

1162
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:01,238
Change of plans.

1163
01:19:03,332 --> 01:19:05,120
Hang on.

1164
01:19:13,434 --> 01:19:16,278
I want that lab, boys.
Whatever it takes.

1165
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:26,741
Hold on.

1166
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:39,755
Oh!

1167
01:19:40,092 --> 01:19:41,780
That undercarriage is filthy!

1168
01:19:41,805 --> 01:19:44,060
Now they have
bigger problems.

1169
01:19:48,616 --> 01:19:51,217
Hope, what are you doing? You're
heading away from the rendezvous point.

1170
01:19:51,242 --> 01:19:53,623
Don't worry. I'm taking these
guys on the scenic route.

1171
01:19:53,648 --> 01:19:56,185
Wait, what
are you... Oh.

1172
01:20:07,846 --> 01:20:08,978
No!

1173
01:20:15,389 --> 01:20:19,529
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, we're
gonna die! We're gonna die!

1174
01:20:31,638 --> 01:20:33,575
Signal lost.

1175
01:20:34,146 --> 01:20:36,810
What the hell are
they doing up there?

1176
01:20:38,419 --> 01:20:40,825
Recalibrating.

1177
01:20:55,423 --> 01:20:57,618
Recalibrating.

1178
01:20:58,329 --> 01:21:01,438
You never said it was
so beautiful, Scott.

1179
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,612
Recalibrating.

1180
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:14,737
Okay. Anytime now.

1181
01:21:14,956 --> 01:21:16,659
Recalibrating.

1182
01:21:19,683 --> 01:21:22,323
- Recalibrating.
- Come on.

1183
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,791
Signal restored.

1184
01:21:37,253 --> 01:21:39,838
Bikes, it's all on you.

1185
01:21:42,917 --> 01:21:45,463
- Take the wheel.
- What? Wait, Hope!

1186
01:21:53,622 --> 01:21:57,520
Well, the 60's were fun.
But now, I'm paying for it!

1187
01:21:57,676 --> 01:21:59,199
Be careful up there!

1188
01:21:59,244 --> 01:22:01,902
Give me a break. I haven't
driven in two years.

1189
01:22:31,084 --> 01:22:33,044
You got pez'd!

1190
01:22:35,143 --> 01:22:36,728
Up here!

1191
01:22:39,179 --> 01:22:41,171
Oh, that's not good.

1192
01:22:44,179 --> 01:22:45,561
Hope!

1193
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:52,025
No!

1194
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,826
There it is right there, the lab.
Get it, get, get, get the lab!

1195
01:23:08,381 --> 01:23:10,959
I've got her.
Westbound on Primo.

1196
01:23:13,544 --> 01:23:15,318
Hope! Wait!

1197
01:23:15,343 --> 01:23:17,764
Hey! What about me?

1198
01:23:26,034 --> 01:23:27,706
We got you now, Ava!

1199
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:55,549
Not again!

1200
01:23:56,838 --> 01:23:58,690
Piece of  junk!

1201
01:24:02,044 --> 01:24:03,559
Yes!

1202
01:24:05,372 --> 01:24:08,083
Go. Go! Go,
go, go, go!

1203
01:24:09,793 --> 01:24:12,878
Burch got the lab.
I'm going after him.

1204
01:24:22,011 --> 01:24:24,260
No, no, no,
no, no!

1205
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:29,432
Work in progress, my ass.

1206
01:24:43,559 --> 01:24:46,088
Scott, where are you? I've got
Burch in my sights. Hurry!

1207
01:24:46,113 --> 01:24:49,231
- I'm coming, I'm coming!
- We're running out of time!

1208
01:24:52,566 --> 01:24:56,253
Warning. Approaching
quantum void.

1209
01:25:20,922 --> 01:25:23,164
I'm coming to you, Honey.

1210
01:26:09,437 --> 01:26:10,437
Guys...

1211
01:26:10,788 --> 01:26:12,631
Don't you need the
remote to the lab?

1212
01:26:12,656 --> 01:26:13,929
I just found it.

1213
01:26:13,954 --> 01:26:16,485
We can't grow the lab without it.
Get it to us, fast.

1214
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:20,110
- Yeah, but the van is busted.
- Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

1215
01:26:22,275 --> 01:26:23,275
Wha?

1216
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,472
I love you, Dr. Pym.

1217
01:26:30,488 --> 01:26:33,987
The remote! We're missing the remote.
We gotta check the van.

1218
01:26:36,674 --> 01:26:37,674
Huh?

1219
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:43,525
Awesome!

1220
01:27:09,581 --> 01:27:12,276
Hey, I'm going left. But
Burch's boys are all over me.

1221
01:27:12,284 --> 01:27:15,729
- I'm on my way.
- Right. I'll get the lab.

1222
01:27:19,065 --> 01:27:20,065
Hi!

1223
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:23,430
Oh, that's badass!

1224
01:27:31,575 --> 01:27:32,739
Nice!

1225
01:27:42,422 --> 01:27:43,422
Toink!

1226
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:52,099
Come here, you little weasel!
Oh, no, you don't!

1227
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:57,177
I guess... Well,
maybe, you do.

1228
01:27:57,505 --> 01:27:59,185
Come on!

1229
01:28:10,836 --> 01:28:14,226
Anyone see a southern gentleman
carrying a building?

1230
01:28:18,009 --> 01:28:20,587
How did he even have
time to buy a ticket?

1231
01:28:22,486 --> 01:28:25,180
Just one time, please. Work!

1232
01:28:25,774 --> 01:28:28,961
Yes! All right, I need help.

1233
01:28:29,469 --> 01:28:30,648
That's it.

1234
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:33,495
Oh... sorry!

1235
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:38,101
Hey! Come on, man!

1236
01:28:38,648 --> 01:28:40,046
Not cool!

1237
01:28:40,484 --> 01:28:42,038
Murderers!

1238
01:28:43,389 --> 01:28:45,507
Yes! Yes!

1239
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:52,536
I'm gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas.
'Cause you're a badass! Yes!

1240
01:28:55,351 --> 01:28:58,554
No. No. No! Ant-onio!

1241
01:29:00,492 --> 01:29:05,179
Our friends the humpbacks dip in here to the
San Francisco bay for a little leisure,

1242
01:29:05,196 --> 01:29:08,000
- and a little breeding.
- Listen, Uzman...

1243
01:29:09,988 --> 01:29:12,529
Just meet me at the
waterfront in three hours.

1244
01:29:12,554 --> 01:29:16,827
Oh, folks, we barely left the dock, but
it looks like we have some company!

1245
01:29:19,952 --> 01:29:23,647
You see it, folks? There it is. There's a breach.

1246
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:25,311
What the...

1247
01:29:30,244 --> 01:29:34,595
Hi. Sorry. Hi. It's
okay, it's okay.

1248
01:29:34,892 --> 01:29:38,033
Sorry. No, I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

1249
01:29:38,058 --> 01:29:40,649
Hey! That doesn't belong to you.

1250
01:29:40,674 --> 01:29:43,573
- No! No! No! No!
- You're embarassing yourself now.

1251
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:46,181
- Come on. Let go!
- No!

1252
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:47,627
Thank you.

1253
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,407
I'll take this now.

1254
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:02,997
No...

1255
01:30:07,365 --> 01:30:09,044
... melts your mind...

1256
01:30:10,302 --> 01:30:12,427
... a message in your head...

1257
01:30:14,497 --> 01:30:17,176
... I had a dream...

1258
01:30:42,555 --> 01:30:44,055
Daddy?

1259
01:30:46,938 --> 01:30:48,211
Dad?

1260
01:30:48,492 --> 01:30:51,975
What's going on? Why
haven't you found Mom?

1261
01:30:53,195 --> 01:30:56,546
You look lost, Hank.
Are you all right?

1262
01:30:57,882 --> 01:31:01,116
Still think you have
all the answers, Hank?

1263
01:31:56,056 --> 01:31:57,579
It's me.

1264
01:32:11,162 --> 01:32:13,162
I'm so sorry!

1265
01:32:15,748 --> 01:32:18,326
- It took so long.
- No.

1266
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:21,052
I do know...

1267
01:32:21,748 --> 01:32:23,466
You're here now.

1268
01:32:24,826 --> 01:32:26,786
Let's go home.

1269
01:32:28,318 --> 01:32:30,685
I thought I was gone.

1270
01:32:30,723 --> 01:32:33,707
But that energy from your hands...

1271
01:32:33,809 --> 01:32:36,332
How did you do that?

1272
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:56,144
I'm not the same woman I
was 30 years ago, Henry.

1273
01:32:56,169 --> 01:32:57,965
This place...

1274
01:32:58,528 --> 01:33:00,723
It changes you.

1275
01:33:02,153 --> 01:33:05,387
And adaptation is part of
it, but some of it is...

1276
01:33:05,403 --> 01:33:07,098
Evolution.

1277
01:33:09,161 --> 01:33:13,512
Lab coordinates not found.
Do not ascend.

1278
01:33:14,059 --> 01:33:17,730
I should probably tell you what
we're dealing with up there.

1279
01:33:19,051 --> 01:33:24,512
I got the lab. I got the lab.
Move. Move...

1280
01:33:25,098 --> 01:33:26,848
Move!

1281
01:33:27,043 --> 01:33:29,418
Get out of the...

1282
01:33:34,733 --> 01:33:36,303
Let's go.

1283
01:33:37,764 --> 01:33:40,865
No one here appears to
be sure what this is.

1284
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:44,732
It seems he's
90, 80, 85 feet tall.

1285
01:33:49,259 --> 01:33:51,907
Get out of the way!

1286
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:56,907
I got the lab. The lab! Okay...

1287
01:33:56,939 --> 01:33:58,266
The earth feels junky.

1288
01:33:58,283 --> 01:34:01,134
Oh, no. He's too big.

1289
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,688
- Scotty!
- Scott!

1290
01:34:06,806 --> 01:34:08,359
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1291
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:11,251
I'm just gonna go to sleep
now for five minutes.

1292
01:34:11,267 --> 01:34:16,032
I just need five minutes.
Five minutes...

1293
01:34:22,466 --> 01:34:25,442
You get the lab somewhere safe.
Scott's air won't last!

1294
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:26,621
Okay!

1295
01:34:41,681 --> 01:34:44,235
Move. Move. Move!

1296
01:34:47,001 --> 01:34:48,743
No, wait!

1297
01:34:59,437 --> 01:35:01,546
Lab at full scale.

1298
01:35:01,554 --> 01:35:03,875
- They did it!
- Ready to ascend.

1299
01:35:03,914 --> 01:35:06,117
Let's go see our daughter.

1300
01:35:27,577 --> 01:35:28,819
Scott.

1301
01:35:30,546 --> 01:35:31,881
Scott!

1302
01:35:32,257 --> 01:35:34,655
Scott, come on. Wake up.

1303
01:35:48,033 --> 01:35:51,283
Come on. Come on.
Where are you, Scott?

1304
01:35:53,107 --> 01:35:54,334
Gotcha.

1305
01:35:58,225 --> 01:35:59,505
Scott?

1306
01:36:05,896 --> 01:36:07,060
Hey!

1307
01:36:10,029 --> 01:36:12,686
Hey, Scotty. Hope, come in.

1308
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:15,336
Do you take any questions
'bout the building?

1309
01:36:16,713 --> 01:36:19,296
- Sco...
- Where's the remote, Luis?

1310
01:36:20,036 --> 01:36:22,137
It's probably in there.

1311
01:36:22,302 --> 01:36:23,692
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

1312
01:36:23,888 --> 01:36:27,700
I guess this is where
we say, Adios, amigo.

1313
01:36:28,286 --> 01:36:29,496
No, no, no!

1314
01:36:33,241 --> 01:36:34,858
Thanks, guys.

1315
01:36:40,605 --> 01:36:43,300
Ava? Ava!

1316
01:36:47,057 --> 01:36:48,057
Ava.

1317
01:36:48,432 --> 01:36:52,072
- Almost ready for extraction.
- Please, stop. People are getting hurt.

1318
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,963
Everything hurts. Don't
talk to me about pain.

1319
01:36:54,987 --> 01:36:58,158
What if Hank was right? What
if this process kills Janet?

1320
01:36:58,408 --> 01:36:59,831
You're worried about her?

1321
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:03,129
All I'm saying is she's a brilliant
scientist. She may be able to help.

1322
01:37:03,153 --> 01:37:05,863
Oh, she will help. Right now.

1323
01:37:05,887 --> 01:37:08,184
And if she dies, she dies!

1324
01:37:09,652 --> 01:37:13,277
I'm sorry, we can't do this.
We have to find another way.

1325
01:37:15,964 --> 01:37:18,128
This is the way.

1326
01:37:38,949 --> 01:37:40,348
Janet!

1327
01:37:51,137 --> 01:37:52,772
She's starting the extraction.

1328
01:37:52,797 --> 01:37:55,083
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

1329
01:38:03,607 --> 01:38:04,880
No!

1330
01:38:38,935 --> 01:38:40,099
Hope!

1331
01:38:57,403 --> 01:38:58,746
Are you okay?

1332
01:39:13,153 --> 01:39:14,449
Mom?

1333
01:39:23,088 --> 01:39:25,080
Oh, my God.

1334
01:39:29,291 --> 01:39:30,845
We found you.

1335
01:39:34,869 --> 01:39:36,377
I missed you so much.

1336
01:39:37,244 --> 01:39:40,001
I missed you too, Jellybean.

1337
01:39:41,938 --> 01:39:47,173
It's okay. I'm, I'm here now.
We have time.

1338
01:39:48,182 --> 01:39:50,736
No more last minute
business trips, okay?

1339
01:39:51,846 --> 01:39:53,158
I promise.

1340
01:39:53,244 --> 01:39:56,298
It's okay, it's fine.
Don't worry about me.

1341
01:39:56,393 --> 01:39:58,275
- I'll be fine.
- Dad!

1342
01:40:03,222 --> 01:40:04,448
Scott.

1343
01:40:04,988 --> 01:40:06,621
Miss Van Dyne.

1344
01:40:08,191 --> 01:40:09,581
It's nice to...

1345
01:40:09,894 --> 01:40:12,081
I guess we've already met.

1346
01:40:12,597 --> 01:40:14,073
I guess we have.

1347
01:40:16,941 --> 01:40:18,292
Wait.

1348
01:40:26,098 --> 01:40:28,066
Your pain...

1349
01:40:29,285 --> 01:40:31,457
I can feel it.

1350
01:40:33,785 --> 01:40:35,286
It hurts.

1351
01:40:36,849 --> 01:40:39,442
It always hurts.

1352
01:40:41,523 --> 01:40:43,249
I'm sorry.

1353
01:40:46,187 --> 01:40:48,851
I think I can help you.

1354
01:41:22,523 --> 01:41:24,812
Do you know she could do that?

1355
01:41:27,859 --> 01:41:29,523
It's okay.

1356
01:41:31,484 --> 01:41:34,984
Guys, the cops are coming. Whoa!

1357
01:41:35,094 --> 01:41:36,351
The, uhh, the...

1358
01:41:36,398 --> 01:41:40,046
The cops are coming.
Like all of them.

1359
01:41:40,086 --> 01:41:42,781
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go.

1360
01:41:43,070 --> 01:41:45,195
What about them?

1361
01:41:48,016 --> 01:41:49,437
Hands in the air!

1362
01:41:49,469 --> 01:41:51,445
No. No, no,
we do our jobs.

1363
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:53,938
You see, we see these guys,
they trying to shoot people.

1364
01:41:53,954 --> 01:41:56,884
So we apprehended them. For you.
You're welcome.

1365
01:41:56,954 --> 01:42:01,195
- We traffic in stolen technology.
- And they have killed many, many people.

1366
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:04,430
- He's in charge.
- That's true. I am.

1367
01:42:04,767 --> 01:42:08,391
I've also committed numerous healthcode
violations in my restaurant.

1368
01:42:08,439 --> 01:42:11,298
Some of them would shock you.

1369
01:42:13,696 --> 01:42:15,664
It is truth serum.

1370
01:42:19,869 --> 01:42:22,954
We gotta get out
of here. Fast.

1371
01:42:24,377 --> 01:42:25,836
I have an idea.

1372
01:42:25,861 --> 01:42:29,228
Giant figure now spotted at the
intersection of Broadway and Wycona.

1373
01:42:29,252 --> 01:42:31,837
- All units move in.
- Go. Go.

1374
01:42:35,051 --> 01:42:37,316
There he is.

1375
01:42:41,261 --> 01:42:43,112
It's over, Scotty.

1376
01:42:43,128 --> 01:42:45,425
I'm sorry but we got you, man.

1377
01:42:45,941 --> 01:42:49,503
Come on, it's the end of the line, pal.
There's nowhere to hide.

1378
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:54,300
Just pull off that band-aid.
You lost. it's okay.

1379
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:58,979
Dammit, Scotty! Reduce yourself!

1380
01:43:04,186 --> 01:43:05,600
Magic?

1381
01:43:08,186 --> 01:43:11,107
Dammit. Get to Lang's. Now.

1382
01:43:17,633 --> 01:43:19,750
Well done, Honey.

1383
01:43:19,852 --> 01:43:21,383
Let's go!

1384
01:43:29,494 --> 01:43:31,619
- Leave me here.
- We can make it.

1385
01:43:31,651 --> 01:43:33,666
You said it yourself.

1386
01:43:34,205 --> 01:43:36,111
I've hurt people.

1387
01:43:36,541 --> 01:43:38,064
But you haven't.

1388
01:43:38,322 --> 01:43:41,634
- Go, please.
- We can make it, Ava.

1389
01:43:41,806 --> 01:43:42,962
Bill...

1390
01:43:43,532 --> 01:43:45,517
I'm not leaving you.

1391
01:44:29,196 --> 01:44:30,446
Oh, hey guys.

1392
01:44:31,087 --> 01:44:33,219
Are my two years up already?

1393
01:44:39,755 --> 01:44:42,872
What's it like out there?
I mean...

1394
01:44:43,044 --> 01:44:46,989
Do people still dance? Are
food trucks still a thing?

1395
01:44:47,246 --> 01:44:50,066
You got away with it
this time, Scott, but...

1396
01:44:50,285 --> 01:44:52,425
I'll be seeing you again.

1397
01:44:52,574 --> 01:44:53,917
Where?

1398
01:44:54,574 --> 01:44:55,574
Huh?

1399
01:44:55,629 --> 01:44:57,980
Where will you be
seeing me again?

1400
01:44:58,082 --> 01:44:59,152
Like...

1401
01:44:59,824 --> 01:45:03,714
in general, I'll see you. Like, the
next time you do something bad.

1402
01:45:03,739 --> 01:45:05,473
- I'll be there. To catch you.
- Ohh.

1403
01:45:05,567 --> 01:45:09,606
You'll be watching me. I thought
you were inviting me somewhere.

1404
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:12,371
Why would I do that?

1405
01:45:12,409 --> 01:45:14,605
That's what I was wondering.
Why would you do that either?

1406
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:16,534
Like a party, or
dinner or something?

1407
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:18,744
I don't know. I thought you
were planning the evening.

1408
01:45:18,769 --> 01:45:21,136
No. I meant to, like, arrest you.
Like, I'll arrest you later again.

1409
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:22,639
- Take it easy.
- Okay.

1410
01:45:24,478 --> 01:45:25,876
Did you wanna go out
tonight or something?

1411
01:45:25,892 --> 01:45:29,251
I mean, 'cause I'm free.
Yeah. Come on.

1412
01:45:38,787 --> 01:45:41,287
- You ready?
- Yes!

1413
01:45:42,178 --> 01:45:44,412
- Daddy!
- Hi!

1414
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:49,281
Yes, that was a...

1415
01:45:49,765 --> 01:45:52,811
- 8:30, Monday.
- Sounds great.

1416
01:45:53,296 --> 01:45:56,811
Mr. Karapetyan?
Yeah, you saw that?

1417
01:45:56,991 --> 01:46:00,453
Well, it would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

1418
01:46:00,617 --> 01:46:03,264
I'll see you Thursday, 9 A.M.
Okay.

1419
01:46:35,786 --> 01:46:37,715
This is awesome.

1420
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:39,575
So, Cassie...

1421
01:46:39,653 --> 01:46:41,770
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

1422
01:46:41,911 --> 01:46:45,496
I wanna help people.
Like my Dad.

1423
01:46:46,051 --> 01:46:47,348
Really?

1424
01:46:48,325 --> 01:46:50,121
I wanted to be his partner.

1425
01:46:50,193 --> 01:46:52,302
But he said he wants you.

1426
01:46:52,873 --> 01:46:54,388
Is that so?

1427
01:46:58,513 --> 01:46:59,755
Daddy!

1428
01:47:01,325 --> 01:47:02,528
Hold on.

1429
01:47:03,357 --> 01:47:05,653
- Move! Get outta here!
- No. Don't. Don't!

1430
01:47:08,677 --> 01:47:10,411
Oh! Gross.

1431
01:47:10,599 --> 01:47:13,060
Ugh. I hate that moth dust.

1432
01:47:13,232 --> 01:47:17,239
Go. Shoo! Shoo!
