00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:18,458
<i>Captain Sakaki, please respond.
We should be able to communicate.</i>

3
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:22,083
My demands are to leave
Planet Tau-e immediately,

4
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,542
and abandon the emigration project.

5
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,792
Until I hear from the captain,
I'm not moving from here.

6
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:31,958
<i>The Tau-e emigration decision was made
by the Central Committee.</i>

7
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:36,125
<i>Your interference will be classified
as a first-degree crime.</i>

8
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,875
People will not survive on that planet!

9
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:42,792
If I'm a criminal,
then the Committee members are murderers!

10
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:43,833
<i>Look at this.</i>

11
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,542
<i>The emigration list is made up
of volunteers.</i>

12
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,042
<i>Why do you interfere?</i>

13
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:49,958
Shut up!

14
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:54,917
<i>You gathered old men and women,
coerced them, and call that volunteering?</i>

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,958
<i>You're going to kill them!</i>

16
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,208
<i>All you want to do
is reduce the mouths to feed!</i>

17
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:01,875
<i>Watch your words, Captain!</i>

18
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,375
We're communicating
through an open channel.

19
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,083
Everyone on this ship can hear us, right?

20
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:12,792
<i>Right now, this ship is trying
to abandon the elderly people.</i>

21
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,792
<i>We may be low on resources.</i>

22
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,125
<i>But can this be forgiven?</i>

23
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:21,625
<i>Weren't we looking for the promised land
that would save us?</i>

24
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:26,125
<i>Can you really abandon the weak
and continue to hold your head up high?</i>

25
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,125
Captain Sakaki.

26
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:30,042
<i>I'll wait one hour.</i>

27
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:34,875
<i>If this ship doesn't change course,
I will blow up this shuttle.</i>

28
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:36,917
<i>I'm not bluffing!</i>

29
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,292
<i>Please stop already, Captain Sakaki.</i>

30
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,375
<i>It's true that we, the volunteers,
really do want to go to Tau-e.</i>

31
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,958
<i>We're not being chased out or anything.</i>

32
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,458
Don't be foolish! This is suicide!

33
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,625
<i>We've been on this ship for over 20 years
while wandering through space.</i>

34
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,708
<i>The young people may be able
to endure this.</i>

35
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,542
<i>But for us, we're at our limit.</i>

36
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:14,292
But... if you give up, then...

37
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,542
<i>Haruo.</i>

38
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,250
- ...then it's all over!
- <i>Haruo!</i>

39
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,542
<i>It's okay.</i>

40
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:25,208
<i>At least, when I die,
I'd like to be standing on land.</i>

41
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,583
<i>It could be on any planet.</i>

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,417
Grandpa.

43
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:07,125
PLANET OF THE MONSTERS

44
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,500
<i>It began in the last summer
of the 20th Century.</i>

45
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,375
<i>Look at that! It's a monster!
This is an unbelievable scene.</i>

46
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,708
<i>For the first time...</i>

47
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:28,917
<i>humanity realized they weren't the rulers
of this planet anymore.</i>

48
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,542
<i>Monsters.</i>

49
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:40,000
<i>From the depths of the earth and sea,
or even from a forgotten divine myth,</i>

50
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,708
<i>they kept appearing, relentlessly.</i>

51
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:47,125
<i>In order to bring an end
to humanity's prosperity.</i>

52
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,125
<i>The UN Countermeasure HQ
has named it "Godzilla."</i>

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,208
<i>And then, in the end,
our worst nightmare appeared.</i>

54
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:56,208
<i>Godzilla.</i>

55
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:00,958
<i>Human or monster,
it burned everything in sight.</i>

56
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,542
<i>The avatar of destruction.</i>

57
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:08,792
<i>At 2:30 EST, a large-scale nuclear attack
was launched against Godzilla, but failed.</i>

58
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:14,708
<i>At midnight, the EC Allied Forces
announced they have begun evacuations...</i>

59
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,500
<i>The earth collapsed
and the skies rained fire.</i>

60
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:24,417
<i>And then, it was not only Earth's humans
who feared its destructive power.</i>

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,750
<i>Above the UN building,
mysterious flying objects...</i>

62
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,250
<i>People of Earth, we are the Exif.</i>

63
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,125
<i>We are observers and predictors.</i>

64
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,042
<i>We have come to tell you of your destiny.</i>

65
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:41,792
<i>The time of destruction is nigh.
You must discover a path to devotion.</i>

66
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:44,875
<i>We are the Bilusaludo.</i>

67
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:49,167
<i>Our home planet, the third planet
in the Bilusaludia Binary System,</i>

68
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,500
<i>was swallowed by an accursed black hole
and destroyed.</i>

69
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:56,458
<i>We are requesting immigration
to this solar system's third planet.</i>

70
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:03,500
<i>If you accept, we promise to eradicate
your greatest threat, Godzilla.</i>

71
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:08,417
<i>Those from a far away galaxy, who were
after this blue planet for themselves,</i>

72
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,625
<i>didn't wait for this paradise of oxygen
and water to become scorched earth.</i>

73
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,875
- <i>Godzilla has passed the defense line!</i>
- <i>The walls will give us some time.</i>

74
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,792
<i>A3 and A5 blocks' AIs are silent!</i>

75
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,083
- <i>Mecha-Godzilla won't activate!</i>
- <i>Why won't it activate?</i>

76
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,542
<i>Atomic breath detected! Incoming!</i>

77
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,125
<i>The fourth armored wall is gone!
It's over!</i>

78
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,750
<i>We have no choice. Evacuate!</i>

79
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,417
<i>All units, evacuate! Hurry!</i>

80
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,167
<i>Wait! If we can activate Mecha-Godzilla,
we can defeat it!</i>

81
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,667
<i>We're leaving, Galu-gu!</i>

82
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:41,250
<i>However, even with the humanoids'
gathered intelligence,</i>

83
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,167
<i>the destroyer's powers
overwhelmed us completely.</i>

84
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:00,875
Where's Mom and Dad?

85
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:04,208
They'll catch up soon.
See? That's the bus.

86
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,708
Hey, what's that?

87
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,125
It's Godzilla!

88
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,792
Godzilla's here!

89
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,417
Haruo! Hurry up!

90
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,917
<i>I remember the flames that burned the sky,</i>

91
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,375
<i>and the sunken, despaired faces
of the adults.</i>

92
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,083
<i>We departed hoping to find
another inhabitable planet.</i>

93
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:19,875
<i>However, we would soon pay the price
for such foolish optimism.</i>

94
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,708
<i>In the frozen, black space,</i>

95
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:31,500
<i>this was a kind of hell
worse than our planet destroyed in flames.</i>

96
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:41,292
<i>There were endless days of suffering
from hunger, thirst, and cold.</i>

97
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,250
<i>Some fell to disease.</i>

98
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,875
<i>And others gradually lost their sanity.</i>

99
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,750
<i>Our brethren's numbers plummeted
in the blink of an eye.</i>

100
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:03,375
<i>Even those still living had no time
to mourn the dead.</i>

101
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:09,125
<i>Kindness and pride are now
long-gone stories of the past.</i>

102
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:20,708
<i>A fairy tale from the time we each had
unlimited access to water and oxygen.</i>

103
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:26,083
<i>Where are we going... and for what reason?</i>

104
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:32,208
<i>Must we endure the misery
of having prolonged our lives</i>

105
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,708
<i>by sacrificing others?</i>

106
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,083
<i>Why are we alive?</i>

107
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:40,667
<i>Why?</i>

108
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,667
<i>Why?</i>

109
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,958
Were you having a nightmare?

110
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,125
So, you're here, Metphies.

111
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:08,333
It's also my job to listen
to a prisoner's confession.

112
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,750
So I should repent to your god?

113
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,208
I'd settle for a fake confession, too.

114
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,875
Here's the data you asked for.

115
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:21,375
Thank you.

116
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,167
You have quite the persistence.

117
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,708
I don't have anything else to do.

118
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,125
Won't you get in trouble
if they find out you're helping?

119
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,125
I have an interest in your enthusiasm.

120
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,208
Why are you so curious
about digging up forbidden data

121
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:41,500
that anyone would otherwise
wish to forget exists?

122
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,958
"Why," you ask?

123
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:47,708
I've also been thinking "why."

124
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:53,417
Ever since I was thrown in here,
that word won't get out of my head.

125
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,667
Why have we become so miserable?

126
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,833
Was it inevitable? A justified punishment?

127
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:02,958
No.

128
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:07,667
The reason we're suffering
is because we lost to that bastard.

129
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:11,042
We didn't fight to the end,
but gave up and ran away.

130
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,208
Everything is destiny.

131
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:20,083
We humanoids had no way
of fighting that monster.

132
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,750
I disagree.

133
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,833
And I'll show them.

134
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,375
We just needed the right strategy
and planning,

135
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,542
and humanity could have defeated it.

136
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,125
I'll prove it.

137
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,208
It's a strange thing.

138
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:48,333
Unlike the young ones, your generation
experienced the calamity firsthand.

139
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:55,875
And yet, it's as if
you want to see that creature again.

140
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:06,125
Based on the Gematron calculation,
the predictions look disappointing.

141
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:12,792
The possibility of finding
a habitable planet in 20 years is 0.1%.

142
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,125
If we want better results than Tau-e,
the outlook is even grimmer.

143
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,500
The lack of resources is severe.

144
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:25,083
Even doubling the discomfort index,
life will be unsustainable in eight years.

145
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,292
The landing ship explosion the other day
was a significant psychological blow.

146
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,292
- This is getting...
- Indeed.

147
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,042
We need to examine scenario number three
in a realistic way.

148
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,500
Returning to Earth.
It's already 11.9 light years away.

149
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:45,417
There's no precedent for traveling so far.
It's too risky.

150
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,333
Gematron's guidance isn't bound
by time or distance.

151
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:53,583
As long as the nuclear reactor
has sufficient energy, travel is possible.

152
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:58,167
According to the ship's simulator,
it requires 170% of its operation ratio.

153
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,958
I don't know if we can mobilize
the manpower.

154
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:05,083
Would it be a constructive decision
to abandon the emigration?

155
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,458
That's the problem.

156
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:10,042
If we return to Earth,
would we be able to survive?

157
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,958
It is currently impossible to calculate
how much time has passed on Earth.

158
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:18,292
At the very least, a few thousand years.

159
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:23,083
Since we fled Earth,
the environment should have calmed down.

160
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,667
It's possible it could've gotten worse.

161
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,625
The problem is that strange thesis
published on the shared server.

162
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:36,875
Why would that research thesis appear
at a time like this?

163
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,417
The writer remains anonymous,

164
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,458
but it contains information that requires
special log-in credentials to access.

165
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,958
The author aside, there's probably
an informant in the Central Committee.

166
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,292
R-Ridiculous!

167
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:58,292
There's an electromagnetic shield
under the body's surface?

168
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,917
It's not a normal organism?

169
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,292
No, its whole body is like a giant coil.

170
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:04,958
Is that true?

171
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,208
So, what happened in the end?

172
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:08,583
It's kind of weird.

173
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,083
A new Gematron code is using 80%
of the calculation server's power.

174
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,250
Eighty percent?

175
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,625
Isn't it the analysis for predictions?

176
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,083
Still, for a simulation, it's too much.

177
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,292
So, the rumor
of returning to Earth is true?

178
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:26,292
It's 11.9 light years in one go.

179
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,625
Is a subspace jump-warp even possible?

180
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,542
It's not a problem
if we use Gematron calculation.

181
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,750
I heard it directly from Navigation.

182
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,917
Gematron, huh?

183
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,833
The ship leaders turn to the gods,
as usual.

184
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:44,375
Maybe even that new anti-Godzilla tactic
was a leak from the higher-ups?

185
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,167
Man, are we going to fight it again?

186
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:52,042
It's a monster that withstood an attack
of 150 nuclear warheads at once.

187
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,375
That's 40 megatons of nucleoplasm total.

188
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:58,833
But the thesis contained new strategies
on how to fight it.

189
00:15:58,917 --> 00:15:59,750
Huh?

190
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,333
It's me.

191
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:14,833
Hey, come in.

192
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:21,833
So, the Central Committee is leaning
towards going to Earth, huh?

193
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,458
Not entirely.

194
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,042
To give up searching
for a habitable planet

195
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,917
means someone has to bear
that responsibility.

196
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:35,417
If they're so weak they give up drifting
after only 20 years, it can't be helped.

197
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,958
Well, I do sympathize.

198
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:43,417
They haven't dealt with the loss
of their home planet as long as we have.

199
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,958
And then, there's your practical joke.

200
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,875
Obviously, it's a headache for Mori.

201
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,000
I uploaded a new version this morning.
Did you read it?

202
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:59,083
Yeah. When I downloaded it,
it already had over 400 views.

203
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,167
Though the file was deleted
three seconds later.

204
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:05,833
Our delinquent captain sure is popular.

205
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:10,917
When there's rumor of returning to Earth,
we get more talk of Godzilla.

206
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:13,958
It's effective for ridiculing
the Central Committee.

207
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,417
Haruo is unaware of
the Central Committee's expectations.

208
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:22,042
He was researching Godzilla
purely for personal interest.

209
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,500
But this thesis has content that will
support our plan to return to Earth.

210
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:32,208
Its claim is that
Godzilla can be defeated by human hands.

211
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:36,833
If you can't understand its contents,
it just sounds like crazy prattling.

212
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,333
Earthlings harbor that much fear
of Godzilla.

213
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,208
So, do you think
it's just crazy prattling?

214
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,583
This analysis report?

215
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,708
No, it's actually quite interesting.

216
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,000
So much so, I think better of him.

217
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,417
Godzilla is not invincible.

218
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:59,083
It's humanity's fault for giving up
on the fight.

219
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,208
That's what Haruo thinks.

220
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:08,958
He analyzed that old data because
of you Exifs' Gematron calculation.

221
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,250
It was impossible for Earthlings
at the time.

222
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,958
Are you saying that, if the weak-point
analysis had been made in time,

223
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,458
that humanity
still wouldn't have been victorious?

224
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,375
And if they did defeat Godzilla,

225
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:28,333
then it was only a matter of time
until Exif's cult took over Earth.

226
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:32,583
Even if Bilusaludo's Mecha-Godzilla
had defeated Godzilla,

227
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,958
no one knows
who it would have bared its fangs at next.

228
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:43,583
However, we failed in the construction
of Mecha-Godzilla.

229
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:47,083
And you couldn't brainwash Earthlings
with your religion.

230
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,750
That's history now.

231
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:52,208
The what-ifs are only fairy tales.

232
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:02,250
Subspace jump-warp procedure,
now entering phase two.

233
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,500
Activating shields for all ship sections.

234
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,917
Bypassing electricity
for the gravitational coil engine.

235
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,250
Initiating Gematron calculation
and gravitational coils controller.

236
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:14,208
Begin cluster connections with Gematron
calculation crystal and central AI.

237
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,708
Gravitational coil engine
for all sections functioning normally.

238
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,000
Preparations for spin complete.

239
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:23,167
Subspace coordinate system render
will be displayed on the central hologram.

240
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,000
Attention all personnel.

241
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:28,750
This ship, Aratrum,
will soon initiate subspace jump-warp.

242
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:33,250
<i>Estimated emergence coordinates are near
the solar system's third planet, Earth.</i>

243
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:37,167
<i>Based on the ship's time,
22 years have passed since our departure.</i>

244
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,667
<i>This subspace jump-warp
will be the longest we've traversed.</i>

245
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,292
Finally. The real Earth!

246
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,875
I wonder if we can see the ocean?

247
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,500
That'd be awesome if we can!

248
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:52,125
The longest? Is this really safe?

249
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,792
<i>...no idea what changes
Earth's environment has undergone.</i>

250
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,042
<i>After an investigation,</i>

251
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:01,750
<i>if we conclude the environment
has become unfit for human survival,</i>

252
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,458
<i>we will collect resources...</i>

253
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,833
Hey, is the real Earth
prettier than the hologram?

254
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,708
Yes, it is.

255
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,750
Entering Gematron-predicted coordinates.
Suspending main propulsion drive.

256
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:16,375
We now have all the Gematron numbers.

257
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,583
Irrational numbers converted to integers.
Computing time-space recon point.

258
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,667
Chances of a wormhole appearing is 440%
in a simulated observation.

259
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,167
Releasing gravitational coil output
for each section of the ship.

260
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,125
Maximum spin.

261
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,042
Captain, on your order.

262
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,000
Initiate jump-warp.

263
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,375
Jump-warp initiated. Commence shift
into phase one space travel.

264
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,583
Gravitational coil at max speed,
running stable.

265
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:10,375
Arriving at launch point
required for final trajectory.

266
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,000
Breaking through subspace.

267
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:41,333
Amazing.

268
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,875
Hey, it's really blue!

269
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,083
- That's the ocean?
- It's beautiful.

270
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,667
That's Earth?

271
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,417
Yes, that's right.

272
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,958
It really is blue!

273
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:54,000
To think that I'd see it again.

274
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:58,375
Disabling shields in all sections.
Normal travel mode stable.

275
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,167
Distance from Earth, 1,800 kilometers.

276
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:04,125
Recalculating low orbit entrance errors.

277
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:13,958
Our Earth that was taken from us.

278
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,500
Orbit errors corrected.

279
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,500
Now entering low Earth orbit.

280
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,750
If we can't land on Earth,
we'll have a revolt on our hands.

281
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:27,333
It's too soon to be pessimistic.

282
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:30,250
Let's just wait for the scouting report.

283
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,750
Unmanned recon drones
launching in sequence.

284
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:40,208
All drone feedback systems are stable.

285
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,542
Begin dispersion to specified areas
for surveillance.

286
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:50,625
Entering the stratosphere.
Drone temperature stable.

287
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:54,750
Altitude 30,000 meters, beginning descent.

288
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,625
Altitude 15,000 meters,
entering the troposphere.

289
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:02,792
Stellar observation parallax calculated.

290
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,125
Elapsed time for the solar system
is approximately 10,000 years.

291
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,667
It's been 10,000 years? That long?

292
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,375
It's more than I imagined.

293
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:12,167
This could be good news.

294
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,542
With that much time,
the ecosystem must have changed.

295
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,667
Not even Godzilla...

296
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:17,875
I wonder.

297
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:20,542
It's possible it could've multiplied.

298
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:23,500
That thing is a genetic aberration.
It's impossible!

299
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:27,708
Recon drones are at a scouting altitude
of 2,000 meters.

300
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,083
Receiving visuals.

301
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,792
Drone six displaying sound signal monitor.

302
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,250
Just the sound of the wind?

303
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,625
We can't see anything.
Can you lower the altitude?

304
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,000
All drones descending.

305
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,917
There are thick particles floating
in the atmosphere.

306
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,625
Average visibility less than 300 meters.

307
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:51,458
This is...
Picking up electromagnetic interference.

308
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:53,417
This isn't just a normal fog.

309
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,792
Switching drones to sensor monitors.

310
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,208
Each drone's altitude at 500 meters.

311
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:03,208
Atmospheric density is increasing.

312
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:05,917
Further descent by remote is impossible.

313
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,042
Is this a forest?

314
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,917
Or some kind of complicated terrain.

315
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,250
Can you increase the scan power?

316
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,625
Its reflection is diffused,
so this is the limit.

317
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,542
What's that?

318
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,333
It's moving.

319
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:24,375
Drone six,
switching to sound wave reconnaissance.

320
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:28,125
Temperature around drone six
is increasing drastically!

321
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,792
- What?
- What's happening?

322
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,958
Drone six, lost!

323
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,667
Estimated energy output around drone six
approximately 180 gigawatts.

324
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,500
High probability of high-energy
electron particles, or atomic breath!

325
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:55,417
M-Maybe it was thunder or...

326
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,833
Idiot! No one would ever forget that roar!

327
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,583
Damn it. It's still on this planet.

328
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,250
You're there, aren't you?

329
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,625
You're still there!

330
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:27,292
If the characteristics match this closely,
then that was Godzilla,

331
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:30,875
or a threat similar to it,
and it must be eliminated.

332
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:37,042
Our one advantage is that it acts
independently rather than in a pack.

333
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:39,417
How can you say that for sure?

334
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,458
The concentration of radiation.

335
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:47,958
As you're aware, Godzilla is a creature
that scatters heavy radiation in its wake.

336
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:52,458
However, even though the terrain
has undergone change,

337
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:56,167
the toxins present in the atmosphere
are maintaining stable numbers.

338
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,167
If we reverse calculate the emission data
gathered in the past three days,

339
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:04,000
multiple Godzillas seem unlikely.

340
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:08,250
Even now,
Godzilla is a unique genetic defect

341
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:12,917
and cannot be considered
a normal living creature, is what I mean.

342
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,250
However, it's been 10,000 years.
How can it still be alive?

343
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:21,417
There are cases where lotus seeds survived
for 2,000 years.

344
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:26,167
It also may be repeating cycles
of dormancy every few thousand years.

345
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:29,125
Or, over 10,000 years,
it could have multiplied

346
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:33,333
and diminished in number,
with this being the last surviving one.

347
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:39,042
Godzilla's biology is beyond
every known aspect of life science.

348
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:43,333
And we can't ignore the possibility
that it could be immortal.

349
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:47,083
Studies and research
aren't this meeting's main subject.

350
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:50,792
We humanoids cannot coexist with Godzilla.

351
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:55,500
However, if that is indeed Godzilla,
and the last one,

352
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,833
then there is only one option.

353
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:00,667
Complete extermination.

354
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:03,250
Are you utterly insane?

355
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:09,500
As you are all aware,
we have drafted anti-Godzilla strategies.

356
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:13,167
You mean that anonymous thesis?

357
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,375
We don't even know who wrote it!

358
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:20,125
It's from a specialist's investigation.

359
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:22,708
It's deemed as promising information.

360
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:29,625
I am also prepared to release the name
of the person who wrote it, right here.

361
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,833
However, there are conditions.

362
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,417
And what would those conditions be?

363
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,208
To drop the charges regarding
the stolen secret information, and then...

364
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,208
release Captain Haruo Sakaki on bail.

365
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:46,167
Captain Sakaki? It was him?

366
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,417
You got us, Metphies.

367
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:55,083
All shall be according to God's will.

368
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,958
It's your turn.

369
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,833
Haruo.

370
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:18,958
It's here. This waveform is generating
the electromagnetic metamaterial.

371
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:24,042
Since each of Godzilla's cells
can function as a powerful electromagnet,

372
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,583
it emits a high-output,
high-frequency electromagnetic pulse

373
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,583
and generates
an asymmetrically permeable shield.

374
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:33,125
A physically impervious shield?

375
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:37,583
It may be enormous,
but can a creature even do that?

376
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:41,792
And if that were true,
how can we even begin to fight it?

377
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:46,583
It's only for about 1/10,000 of a second,
but it emits a noise periodically.

378
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,833
If we use an interference wave,
we can amplify that noise

379
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:54,917
to fracture the metamaterial,
and we'll target that point.

380
00:28:55,417 --> 00:29:00,375
So by attacking a single point,
we can take that colossal thing down?

381
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:04,417
There should be an organ
amplifying the electromagnetic pulse.

382
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,458
If we destroy that,
we can neutralize the shield.

383
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,000
And where is it?

384
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,292
Unknown.

385
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,667
There isn't enough data
in our visual records.

386
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:18,125
We need to observe Godzilla
and analyze the emission pattern.

387
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,292
As you know from past battles,

388
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,125
we can confirm Godzilla has
tremendous regenerative abilities.

389
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:30,500
The destroyed organs will regenerate, and
in the seconds before the shield goes up,

390
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:35,042
we need to shove an EMP probe
into its body and destroy it from within.

391
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:38,875
The main issue with this operation
is the changed atmosphere,

392
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:41,708
and the electromagnetic wave interference.

393
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:44,667
To observe and find Godzilla's weak point,

394
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,667
we need detailed coordination
with accurate attacks,

395
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:50,167
so close quarters combat is required.

396
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:51,875
And for each process,

397
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,083
we need manpower,
otherwise we cannot succeed.

398
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,292
Preposterous!

399
00:29:56,833 --> 00:30:00,708
Even if we gather all the races,
there are only 4,000 of us.

400
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:04,167
I cannot approve an operation
where lives can be lost.

401
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,958
Captain Sakaki.

402
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:07,792
I'll be blunt.

403
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:12,750
In order for your operation to work,
how many people do you need?

404
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:17,458
Combat engineers, infantry,
and special forces, so three battalions.

405
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,208
If I form two companies from each,

406
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:22,500
we're looking at about 600 people.

407
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:25,667
Out of the question.

408
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:34,125
Those who do not fight,
know not how to fight evil.

409
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:38,417
Those gathered now, unified as one,
shall come to know God's mercy.

410
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,167
Give praise to God.
All shall lead down the devoted path.

411
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:47,833
Garbetrium guidance be with you all.

412
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:53,958
<i>This is Colonel Elliot Leland,
commander of the Earth Landing Brigade.</i>

413
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:56,333
<i>Everyone, continue your tasks and listen.</i>

414
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:01,042
<i>All 600 gathered here
are the chosen elite forces</i>

415
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:05,958
<i>who have decided to give their lives
to fight against Godzilla.</i>

416
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,292
<i>Everyone correctly understands</i>

417
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:15,333
<i>that there will be no constructive outlook
if you're trapped in an old society.</i>

418
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,958
<i>Instead of a fake promised land,</i>

419
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,625
we will take back our homeland,

420
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,958
and promise prosperity
to the next generation.

421
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:29,458
For the sake of humanity's future,
I look forward to everyone's efforts.

422
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,208
All assembled landing ships
have exited the gates.

423
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,583
Now closing the first launch gate station.

424
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:51,250
That speech sounded like you wanted
to pick a fight with the Committee.

425
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:53,708
Hey, Haruo.

426
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:58,875
Didn't you also want to get
the Committee members frustrated?

427
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:03,708
With the current system,
those members will just dry up and die.

428
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,875
There aren't any comfortable chairs
for us.

429
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,208
But if we defeat Godzilla,
then the story will be different.

430
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,750
A new hero will arrive.

431
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:15,875
Our era will come.

432
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,250
A hero, huh?

433
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,875
You're just like when you were a kid.

434
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,792
Don't take it the wrong way.
You're still on bail status.

435
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,250
We went through a lot
just to get you back out.

436
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,167
Commander.

437
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:33,750
All landing ships have assembled
in low orbit.

438
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,750
All ships, enter in sequential order.

439
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:38,667
<i>Roger.</i>

440
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,750
<i>All ships,
begin entry in sequential order.</i>

441
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:47,125
Ship ten, ignite engine.

442
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,958
Deploy anti-aerodynamic drag
and heat shield.

443
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:53,583
You look unhappy.

444
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,125
Even though your wish is being granted.

445
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,292
I wonder if everything will go
according to plan.

446
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:03,917
It'll be okay. As long as we have the hero
who will guide them.

447
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,792
Are you a Leland sympathizer?

448
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:11,125
Well, the one I put my hope in
is you,

449
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:12,667
Haruo.

450
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,708
The one true path to glory
can only be opened through devotion.

451
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,208
This is our, the Exif's, creed.

452
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,083
There are only a few Earthlings
who embody that.

453
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,042
You're a rare exception.

454
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:31,667
You overestimate me.

455
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:36,250
You are the one who is worthy
of fighting Godzilla.

456
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:40,250
The time will come soon enough
when that can be proven.

457
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:52,458
Ship temperature stable.

458
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,583
Passing the stratosphere.

459
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,375
Altitude 30,000 meters.

460
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:01,250
Igniting arc jet thrusters for cruising.

461
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:15,583
Once we go under those clouds,
we won't see the sun anymore, huh?

462
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,542
This planet has been
completely changed, too.

463
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,667
Now entering the troposphere.

464
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:27,083
Altitude 2,000. All ships,
begin navigating towards landing zone.

465
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,833
The visibility's terrible.

466
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,667
Switching the ship's probes to ultrasonic.

467
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,458
Begin image processing.

468
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:38,250
Company A, landing zone confirmed.

469
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,833
Obstacles detected.

470
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:44,042
As the reconnaissance drones reported,
this is a thick forest.

471
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:47,875
Securing landing point now.
Prepare the thermobaric bombs.

472
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,417
Roger. Dropping thermo-pressure warheads.

473
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,458
They're being grandiose over there.

474
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:07,667
Well, the special forces will land
on impeded terrain.

475
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:09,292
What?

476
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:12,417
An obstacle collided
with the ship's exterior.

477
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:15,833
No issues so far with power and steering.

478
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:17,500
An obstacle?

479
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:31,333
Lieutenant Colonel Galu-gu,
Company E has also landed.

480
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:34,792
We will now set
the combat engineers' traps.

481
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:35,708
Okay.

482
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:39,833
The old Tanzawa Pass, huh?

483
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,667
If it was sunny,
it would've been beautiful.

484
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:48,292
With this heavy fog,
a visual battle would be impossible.

485
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,875
Lieutenant Colonel Galu-gu, please look.

486
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:53,875
This is...

487
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:56,708
Doesn't it look like
something scratched it?

488
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:00,208
I hope the others are okay out there.

489
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,792
Get the transmission balloons!

490
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:06,583
You don't need to unload
the medical supplies.

491
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:17,875
Transmission balloon reception favorable.

492
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:23,250
Companies B and C special force units
will reach their destination on schedule.

493
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:28,750
Companies D and E will deploy artillery
as the combat engineers lay down traps.

494
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:32,583
Okay, the first battle formation
is going according to plan.

495
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:37,542
Whichever company finds Godzilla first,
open fire with the special forces.

496
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,542
Provoke it and divert its course.

497
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:45,208
What's important is to observe Godzilla's
electromagnetic waves when it's attacked.

498
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:50,667
We'll analyze this data to see which organ
emits the electromagnetic wave.

499
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,333
Once we destroy that, we can neutralize
the asymmetrically permeable shield.

500
00:36:56,208 --> 00:37:00,167
And finally, we'll chase Godzilla
into this Tanzawa Pass,

501
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:03,208
and slow it
with traps set by the engineers.

502
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:06,667
The artillery unit will then open fire
from a close range.

503
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:12,042
We'll amplify the pulse noise,
attack all at once, and destroy the organ.

504
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:18,000
The shield will go down for a few seconds,
and then we'll use EMP probes to end it.

505
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:23,167
If we can't find the amplifying organ,
we can't place the infantry.

506
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,458
Exactly.

507
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:29,417
The special forces analysis of the pattern
will influence the plan.

508
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,500
So they'll spread out into a wide area,
and advance while analyzing the enemy.

509
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:36,292
Cooperation is key.

510
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:42,167
But who knew we'd have to rely
on something this pathetic to communicate?

511
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:46,125
If we can transmit
through this convection cloud,

512
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:50,458
the drones in the stratosphere will relay
our communication with no issues.

513
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:54,500
But in this fog,
electronic communication will be limited.

514
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:57,833
What is going on
with this planet's atmosphere?

515
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,583
That's what we're trying to find out.

516
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:04,208
Colonel, I'd like to form
an investigation team.

517
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:07,125
If I can borrow three teams, as planned.

518
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:10,875
The scouting team takes priority.
I'll give you two teams.

519
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,583
All right, then.

520
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:17,458
I'd like to go, too. I want to see with
my own eyes how this terrain has changed.

521
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:18,708
You heard him.

522
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:21,667
- Master Sergeant Yuko Tani, you're up.
- Yuko?

523
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,167
You'll be his handler.
As you know, he's been released on bail.

524
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,500
So be careful handling him.

525
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:33,708
Understood.

526
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:57,875
Unbelievable. Are these really the plants
growing on Earth?

527
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:01,667
Is this what I saw in the ship's records?
Trees, was it?

528
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,583
They look different, though.

529
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:20,208
Don't touch it!

530
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,583
In some places they're sharp as razors.

531
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,458
It'd be deadly
if your airtight suit got a hole in it.

532
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,250
Why did you request to join this mission?

533
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:56,375
Because you're involved, Captain Sakaki,
and set up the operation.

534
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:59,917
Please don't call me that.
Just Haruo is fine.

535
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:06,458
I've always wanted to meet you
so we could speak in person.

536
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:12,958
I wondered if it's because of you, Cap...
Haruo, that grandpa died at Tau-e.

537
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,083
I...

538
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:17,417
The bombs that you brought
inside the shuttle,

539
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:22,167
I heard from security
that they were definitely all removed.

540
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,917
But then the emigration group...

541
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:27,875
Do you think it was an accident?

542
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,083
You don't think it was?

543
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:36,833
You said the Central Committee
wanted to reduce passengers.

544
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:41,292
They could have used some trick
so the emigration group wouldn't...

545
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,708
The Central Committee isn't that corrupt!

546
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,125
That's what I want to think. I don't
want to be suspicious of my comrades.

547
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:50,625
Haruo.

548
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:57,167
No, that's not it. I couldn't forgive
myself for wanting to be suspicious.

549
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:00,167
I don't want to be so judgmental
of humans.

550
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:05,167
But being on that claustrophobic ship
and living on minimal supplies,

551
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:08,000
it's normal for people
to become mistrustful.

552
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:13,542
Godzilla didn't just steal Earth
away from us.

553
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:18,000
Justice, faith, and the basic pride
we have as humans...

554
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:20,875
we've come to lose them, too.

555
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:26,167
And that's why
we need to fight Godzilla again.

556
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:30,167
So we can take back the dignity we lost.

557
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:37,875
This is...

558
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,875
<i>Professor! Please come!</i>

559
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:42,458
Over there!

560
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,417
Ruins?

561
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:54,417
But they couldn't have lasted
10,000 years.

562
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:57,000
Captain Sakaki!

563
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,833
I see.

564
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:09,667
The lichen used the building's surface
as a seedbed and became fossilized.

565
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:12,875
Afterwards,
the building materials weathered away,

566
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:16,333
but the fossilized fungus
must have retained the shape.

567
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:22,042
This is Earth's civilization.
People used to live here?

568
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:26,458
Haruo?

569
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:28,792
It remembered.

570
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:37,250
Although we've forgotten,
this planet has always remembered us.

571
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:45,125
Of course. Even after undergoing change,
this is still our Mother Earth.

572
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,958
The planet that belongs to humans.

573
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:51,792
We'll take it back... no matter what.

574
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:55,500
With our own hands.

575
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:05,125
Where's the scouting team?
Haven't they responded yet?

576
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,500
It's probably the electromagnetic waves.

577
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:09,708
The reception area
is five kilometers, right?

578
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:10,625
Yes.

579
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:13,375
Unexpected atmospheric changes
are also possible.

580
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:16,417
There are reports of geomagnetic storms.

581
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:20,083
But we're connected with
Martin's investigation team. It's strange!

582
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Hey, what's that?

583
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,458
Is it the scouting team?

584
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:01,417
What?

585
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:03,792
Damn it! Kill it!

586
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:12,208
- What?
- Something happened at the camp!

587
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:14,458
- Professor Martin!
- Let's go back, now!

588
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:38,750
This doesn't correspond to any
of Earth's primary species records.

589
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,667
It must be a sudden variant,

590
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:46,000
otherwise, how could something evolve
into a form like this?

591
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,542
Would living organisms
go through such a change,

592
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:52,083
even if 10,000 years have passed?

593
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:55,083
We collected
and analyzed the forest's plants,

594
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:59,458
and by using carbon dating,
I know how much time has passed.

595
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:04,375
And it looks to be within a 50-year range
of 19,200 years.

596
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:07,500
So our time away keeps increasing.

597
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:12,958
The special cell characteristics of this
beast and the plants are interesting.

598
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:15,917
Okay, it came off.

599
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:23,083
The flora and fauna have differences,
but also similar, wide-ranging traits.

600
00:45:23,542 --> 00:45:26,625
Along with characteristics
very similar to metal,

601
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:29,458
they have bodily functions
that exert powerful magnetism.

602
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:31,125
The same as Godzilla?

603
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:36,625
Yes. This beast is small, but it may be
in the same family as Godzilla.

604
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,917
What's surprising is that the plants also
have strikingly similar characteristics.

605
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,917
So this fog causing
the electromagnetic disturbance...

606
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,500
The particles in the air
are the pollen of this forest's plants.

607
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:52,417
It could also be their natural chaff.

608
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:56,000
If the fog's caused by the organisms
and not the weather,

609
00:45:56,083 --> 00:46:00,333
we have to burn the entire forest down
to disperse this fog?

610
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:04,875
So, we have no choice
but to abandon our first plan of waiting

611
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:08,250
for the weather to clear up a bit
before we attack.

612
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:09,542
That's not all.

613
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:12,250
If dangerous beasts are wandering around,

614
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:14,958
I have to split up our troops
for camp defense.

615
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:18,333
We can reassign groups
to join the special forces.

616
00:46:18,417 --> 00:46:19,542
Don't be ridiculous!

617
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:24,042
You want everyone to wander in
this unknown environment without a plan?

618
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:25,542
Then what's your plan?

619
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,208
Retreat.

620
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:30,708
Logically, that's our only choice.

621
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:32,083
What are you saying?

622
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:36,458
The water and plants are toxic,
and the wild animals are hostile.

623
00:46:36,542 --> 00:46:39,708
The only benefits here
are air pressure and gravity.

624
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:44,625
It'd be the height of stupidity
to fight Godzilla to reclaim this planet.

625
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:49,042
This is our home!

626
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:53,042
You're giving up?
Not only once, but twice?

627
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:58,917
We can settle on the surface of the moon,
and collect resources from Earth.

628
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:02,833
If we're thinking about safety,
it's a more realistic plan.

629
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:07,375
Weren't you going to defeat Godzilla
and become a hero?

630
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:12,167
I underestimated the situation.
My eyes are open now and I've learned!

631
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,542
You're going to be a coward now?

632
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:19,833
From wild beasts alone,
we have 12 dead and 35 critically injured!

633
00:47:19,917 --> 00:47:22,750
Without even seeing Godzilla,
this is the outcome!

634
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:27,208
We can't play war with new soldiers
who've never fought in actual combat.

635
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:29,542
Retreat?

636
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,417
I do agree with the commander's decision,
but the problem is, how do we retreat?

637
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,708
That attack just now

638
00:47:38,042 --> 00:47:41,792
left us with heavier equipment loss
than human casualties.

639
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,833
Is that so?

640
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:48,917
Frustratingly, those lizard things
destroyed four landing ships.

641
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:54,667
Ship one and two's fuel systems and
ship three and four's engines are dead.

642
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,542
We can't return to the mother ship
orbiting this planet anymore.

643
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:02,625
If that's the case,
we need to gather Company A,

644
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:08,042
and join the company with enough
transit power to get us all back to space.

645
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:12,875
Companies B and C are special forces
like us, so they can't do it.

646
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:17,125
So we must join the artillery unit
and the trap materials unit,

647
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:19,667
which are Companies D and E.

648
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:25,625
In order for us to escape
the wild animals' habitat,

649
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,375
we must move through
this old Tanzawa Pass.

650
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:35,167
And our first plan was to go through
the projected encounter area for Godzilla.

651
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,375
That's correct.

652
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,500
We need to pass the area
where Godzilla appears frequently.

653
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:49,875
Of course, if we run into Godzilla,
that would be extremely awful for us.

654
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:52,292
In order to secure safe passage...

655
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:56,542
We would need backup
from Companies B and C.

656
00:48:57,042 --> 00:49:02,250
However, if we join up and form a cluster,
we'll be open to an atomic breath attack.

657
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:04,750
What's the safest plan?

658
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:07,375
While remaining spread out,

659
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:12,667
repeatedly reciprocate the threat
and keep securing each other's safety.

660
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:17,750
Yes. This is, however, quite close
to Captain Sakaki's original plan,

661
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:20,875
with very few changes.

662
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:27,875
Listen here.
This is a retreat tactic, no matter what.

663
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:31,208
We will not take any action
to lure out Godzilla.

664
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:36,583
Once all units reach the gathering point,
we complete the mission,

665
00:49:36,792 --> 00:49:38,542
and return to the mother ship.

666
00:49:39,792 --> 00:49:41,375
Be careful of that crack.

667
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:44,792
Okay, that's good. This way!

668
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:48,708
There's no fuse,
but it could still explode, so be careful.

669
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:51,708
- That's a high explosive. Be careful.
- Yeah.

670
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:56,292
<i>Company B, C, and all landing ships,
heading to Company D camp.</i>

671
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:58,708
- <i>Confirm landing zone.</i>
- <i>Landing zone confirmed.</i>

672
00:49:58,792 --> 00:50:01,250
<i>All ships rotate bearing
to 202.5 degrees.</i>

673
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:02,583
- <i>Marker lock.</i>
- <i>Roger.</i>

674
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,083
So what's the situation?

675
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:07,375
Company B, Company C reserves,

676
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:12,375
and Company A hover squads
are to join with Company D and stand by.

677
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:16,417
What's going on? Is the plan a go, or no?

678
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:20,042
Based on Commander Leland's orders
to the hover squads,

679
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:22,542
special forces
will abandon the base camps.

680
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:26,375
After all units reach the final
gathering point, we'll retreat.

681
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:31,042
We'll follow our original path,
but we won't search for Godzilla.

682
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:37,125
So, what? Did we come down to Earth
just to display our marching orders?

683
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,500
Company A's damage
must have been that severe.

684
00:50:40,917 --> 00:50:44,125
I heard there were
smaller Godzilla-like creatures.

685
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,208
They were strong enough
to destroy a power suit.

686
00:50:47,542 --> 00:50:51,375
Leland, that coward. If he's going
to go along with Haruo's madness,

687
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:54,208
he has to resign himself
from the beginning.

688
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:58,792
They had us design this,

689
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,542
and now we have to abandon it
because of overcapacity?

690
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:09,792
Approaching Godzilla's
projected contact area.

691
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:13,167
Hurry! We need to
get through this area quickly!

692
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,167
Can't this thing pump out any more speed?

693
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:23,500
By shifting parts around,
we got ship two moving.

694
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:26,500
It's all we can do to keep it hovering.

695
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,292
I guess I'm thankful that it's moving.

696
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:32,583
I wouldn't want to walk through
this forest at all.

697
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:35,375
Are you having foreboding thoughts?

698
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:40,750
If this ends without us encountering
Godzilla, then why did I come here?

699
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:44,083
Were you hoping to depend on luck?

700
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:46,833
It's fine if we're actively searching,

701
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:51,167
but if we pass by in a rush,
then we won't even find anything.

702
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:56,417
That's if we were actively searching
for Godzilla, right?

703
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:59,000
You and Colonel Leland

704
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,917
still don't understand one crucial aspect
of that thing.

705
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,542
It will never let humanity escape.

706
00:52:06,667 --> 00:52:10,542
Even more so if we've come to provoke it
without a trace of fear.

707
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:13,167
So, it will be searching for us?

708
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,958
Is that some divine message from god?

709
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:19,458
It's a legend.

710
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:24,542
We Exif have been wandering
through space as vagrants

711
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:26,458
far longer than Earthlings have,

712
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:29,417
and we've witnessed
many civilizations destroyed.

713
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:36,333
Many have been regretfully destroyed
by creatures similar to Godzilla.

714
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:37,625
What's that?

715
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:41,667
He is the punishing iron hammer
for the arrogant.

716
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:45,917
For the species who pronounce themselves
as lords of creation,

717
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,542
a divine avenger will pay them a visit.

718
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,250
And so, he will...

719
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:54,750
What was that?

720
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:56,583
An earthquake?

721
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:08,667
Sound wave analysis!
All units, prepare for battle!

722
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:15,042
Movement detected at two o'clock!
It's approaching!

723
00:53:24,292 --> 00:53:25,833
Evade! Evade, now!

724
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:36,625
We can't evade in time!

725
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:53,833
Run, Haruo.

726
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,125
Do as your soul cries out to do.

727
00:53:57,875 --> 00:53:58,708
Yeah.

728
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:19,500
The propellant is leaking!
It's going to explode!

729
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,833
Hurry!

730
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:01,375
I'll get you for this!

731
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,292
That idiot.

732
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:07,375
Haruo, why?

733
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:11,792
He's going to record the moment
Godzilla activates its shield.

734
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:14,750
And to do that, you have to attack it.

735
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:23,250
Damn it, the electromagnetic sensor
isn't responding. Why?

736
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:27,500
What are you doing? Let's go!

737
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:29,417
But then, Captain Sakaki...

738
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:32,708
Then, get out.

739
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:36,625
Again! This time, at a closer distance!

740
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:41,167
Damn it!

741
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,167
I see.

742
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:45,958
Such light damage
won't cause the shield to activate.

743
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:47,333
Professor Martin!

744
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:51,083
<i>Please record this next attack
with the sensor.</i>

745
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:53,208
Captain! What's your plan?

746
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:56,417
<i>I'm going to nose-dive
and slam into it.</i>

747
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:57,792
What?

748
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:07,000
You bastard, I will...

749
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,833
What?

750
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:40,125
This planet can go to hell.

751
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:53,208
Leland.

752
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,000
Colonel Leland was killed?

753
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:25,250
<i>Yes. According to rank,
the command will now fall to me, though...</i>

754
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:26,583
Can you do it?

755
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:31,792
<i>I'll need to reassign a subordinate
who has disobeyed military regulations.</i>

756
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:34,375
<i>This is an emergency,
so please understand.</i>

757
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:38,750
For this occasion, fine.
Bring back as many people as you can.

758
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:40,208
<i>Understood.</i>

759
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:46,375
Did you analyze the data sent to us?

760
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:47,583
Finished just now.

761
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,833
The electromagnetic metamaterial's
output has been recorded.

762
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:54,000
Just as you surmised, a shield exists.

763
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,958
The noise in question was confirmed.

764
00:57:57,542 --> 00:57:59,500
It's not unified across its body.

765
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:01,667
There's clearly a concentrated spot.

766
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,667
The dorsal fin?

767
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:07,792
This is where the shield is generated.
Leland gave his life for this information.

768
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:15,417
Everyone, during that earlier encounter,
Colonel Leland died an honorable death.

769
00:58:16,542 --> 00:58:20,208
And so,
as the Central Committee's direct priest,

770
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:23,458
I have accepted full responsibility
for this operation.

771
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:28,750
However, I cannot say that I am
the best man for this job.

772
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:34,667
All people are born to accomplish the task
they were meant to do.

773
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:38,458
This has been established
in our scriptures,

774
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:43,625
and as I shoulder the burden of a priest,
I cannot turn my back to this truth.

775
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:48,583
With the premise
of taking full responsibility,

776
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,750
I will now entrust all decision-making...

777
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:56,167
to Captain Sakaki, as the commander.

778
00:58:57,875 --> 00:58:59,958
Okay, Haruo.

779
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:01,875
Your orders.

780
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:03,250
But that's insane!

781
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:18,750
The situation is dire,
so I'll skip the pleasantries.

782
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:23,625
I don't have an outlook
for humanity's future,

783
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:28,875
and I don't have enough of a strategy
to estimate our chances of winning.

784
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:31,792
However, I can say this.

785
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:37,208
Those who didn't yield to Godzilla
can proudly welcome another day.

786
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:41,375
This is not only a battle
to kill Godzilla.

787
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:45,917
What we are about to fight
is a humiliating future

788
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:49,667
with no choice
but to accept despair and resignation.

789
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:57,542
If we can reject and fight that,
we can once again dream of hope and pride.

790
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,833
Just as our ancestors did,
who thrived here before us.

791
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:06,167
That's right. If we don't retreat now,
if we don't show fear,

792
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:10,000
and if we put our lives on the line,
we've already won.

793
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:12,625
All we need to do is finish it.

794
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:17,875
Humanity's 22-year-long nightmare,
and Godzilla's 20,000-year era.

795
01:00:20,792 --> 01:00:24,083
I look forward to your brave efforts.
That is all.

796
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:37,375
We'll begin our operation.

797
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:40,083
Yuko, you know Godzilla's position, right?

798
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:43,375
Yes.
It's about 80 kilometers north-north-east.

799
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:46,083
Moving southwest
at 40 kilometers an hour.

800
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:49,875
Set up transmission balloons
every 3,000 meters on the battlefield.

801
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:52,792
- We need optimal communicative reception.
- Roger.

802
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:56,875
Major Belu-be, provoke Godzilla
from a distance and watch its reaction.

803
01:00:56,958 --> 01:00:58,542
Maintain that distance.

804
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:00,125
Sure, leave it to me.

805
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:02,458
Adam, watch for the atomic breath.

806
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,875
If electric potential rises,
escape immediately.

807
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,833
Understood.

808
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:07,208
Galu-gu.

809
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:11,292
I'll move to the trap point
and command the power suit team directly.

810
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:12,375
What?

811
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:16,833
I'll determine the EMP probes'
target point on-site.

812
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:18,458
However...

813
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,083
Galu-gu, how are the trap placements?

814
01:01:21,167 --> 01:01:22,792
All according to plan.

815
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:25,333
Its weak point is the dorsal fin,
its back.

816
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:28,708
Since we need to concentrate our fire
at a close distance,

817
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:33,833
we have to let it pass the line of fire,
and lure it deeper into the valley.

818
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:36,208
So we only have one chance.

819
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:40,667
To make this plan work, we need
to place the traps deeper in the valley.

820
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,417
Artillery units are all in position.

821
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:54,625
We're ready.

822
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,750
Can we really lure it
all the way out here?

823
01:01:57,833 --> 01:02:00,625
We have no choice but to believe in them.

824
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:07,333
Power suit team, move to the trap point.
We'll stand by.

825
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:11,833
I'm leaving the diversion to you, Belu-be.

826
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:13,208
Roger.

827
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:19,250
All squads, ascend to planned altitude.
Cross-delta pattern formation.

828
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:33,000
Godzilla detected
at the projected contact area.

829
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:36,208
All units, commence the diversion plan.

830
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:38,083
Right wing, squad one, attack!

831
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:42,917
Godzilla sighting confirmed!

832
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:43,958
Fire!

833
01:02:46,917 --> 01:02:47,875
All units, turn!

834
01:02:57,583 --> 01:03:01,250
Ascend in battle formation.
We'll attack as long as possible!

835
01:03:09,792 --> 01:03:11,583
Target successfully diverted.

836
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:13,167
We can do this!

837
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,083
Evade!

838
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,000
Damn it! Adam! Take the left wing!

839
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:27,792
Roger, left wing, squad one.

840
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:30,833
- The impact area is bigger!
- It's hard to evade!

841
01:03:30,917 --> 01:03:34,333
The evading maneuvers
are just a second delayed. Let's go!

842
01:03:43,917 --> 01:03:46,917
- Right wing, squad two, follow and attack!
- Roger!

843
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:02,083
These guys aren't part of the plan!

844
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:03,458
What's wrong?

845
01:04:03,542 --> 01:04:05,917
<i>Major Belu-be!
It's what attacked Company A!</i>

846
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:10,208
What? All squads provide cover fire
from a higher altitude.

847
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:13,542
Shoot them down
before more come from the forest!

848
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,792
Left wing, squad two, counterattack!

849
01:04:32,667 --> 01:04:34,625
We have no time for the small fish.

850
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:37,625
Left wing, squad two,
continue the diversion!

851
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:50,250
<i>Belu-be, are you okay?</i>

852
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,292
It seems like you're in trouble.

853
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:56,625
<i>Like the simulations predicted,
we should be able to lure it to the spot.</i>

854
01:04:56,708 --> 01:04:58,167
<i>But we need more firepower.</i>

855
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:01,125
It'll be night soon.
Can you hasten the process?

856
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:04,625
<i>Ten have gone down.
Ammo and gas are almost depleted.</i>

857
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:06,375
Adam. Do you copy?

858
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:09,042
Yes. Captain, I copy.

859
01:05:09,542 --> 01:05:11,958
- <i>I'm reassigning you.</i>
- What, right now?

860
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:15,000
I'm shortening the time allotted
to lure Godzilla.

861
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:17,208
What? How can we do that?

862
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:21,458
<i>I'll use the landing ships
for a bombardment to create a path.</i>

863
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,125
What? Send the landing ships
to the frontline?

864
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:25,375
It's too dangerous.

865
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,917
If they get shot down,
how will we return to the mother ship?

866
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,917
But we're already home.

867
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:35,792
There's nowhere else to return to
but here. Isn't that right?

868
01:05:36,625 --> 01:05:38,167
Have you lost your mind?

869
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,375
Let's do it.

870
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:42,542
It'll be useless
to prepare an escape route.

871
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:45,792
In order to win,
we need to play every hand.

872
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,833
This is why belligerent species
are difficult to deal with.

873
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:54,875
Adam, select five elite pilots.
Prepare the landing ships for takeoff.

874
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:56,125
Roger.

875
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:59,792
Major Belu-be, Second Lieutenant
Adam Bindewald, withdrawing!

876
01:06:00,208 --> 01:06:02,958
Hurry and go! We'll handle this somehow!

877
01:06:03,917 --> 01:06:06,042
Right wing, squad one, charge again!

878
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:10,917
Don't fall behind!

879
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:25,583
Six elite pilots, standing by!

880
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:27,333
We can go anytime!

881
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:29,667
<i>Load all ammunition, even the reserves.</i>

882
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,167
If we mess up, that's it.

883
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:32,292
Roger!

884
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:34,375
All landing ships, depart!

885
01:06:35,042 --> 01:06:39,083
Starting from Godzilla's position,
create a path until the signal is given.

886
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:41,667
Fire at will, if you must.

887
01:06:41,792 --> 01:06:44,250
Eliminate any obstacles in its way.

888
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:47,292
Commencing final diversion.

889
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:51,083
This is the point of no return.
We'll end this, now.

890
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:56,375
Listen up, the landing ships' mobility
can't evade an attack in time.

891
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:59,167
Once you know you're targeted,
abandon ship!

892
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:01,250
Captain, you're being lavish!

893
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:05,708
Hover squads, save ammo until
the route is open. Minimize losses.

894
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:09,833
Roger. We're almost out of gas.
So there's no second chances!

895
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:12,792
Turn!

896
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:22,583
The landing ships are almost here!

897
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:25,000
Spread out to avoid the bombardment!

898
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:31,333
All ships, drop the thermobaric bombs!
Scatter all that you have!

899
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:44,417
All landing ships, disperse! Spread out!

900
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,875
So who drew the short straw?

901
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:54,250
It's me, huh?

902
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:12,125
Okay! Godzilla is on the diversion path!

903
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:16,083
Now! All hover squads,
fire everything you have! This is it!

904
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:20,292
Roger! All squads, resume the diversion!
Increase attack frequency!

905
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:27,542
Damn it!

906
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:31,458
It's no good! I can't speed up!

907
01:08:34,792 --> 01:08:37,667
All squads! Join the left wing!
Just a little more!

908
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,500
<i>Diversion is in progress.</i>

909
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:44,500
<i>Godzilla is accelerating
toward the trap point!</i>

910
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:46,458
<i>Haruo, please hurry and board.</i>

911
01:08:46,542 --> 01:08:47,417
Yuko!

912
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,542
<i>Why are you here?</i>

913
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,375
I've always been on the power suit team.

914
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:54,667
<i>Do you understand?
This is practically a suicide mission!</i>

915
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:56,792
I want to become stronger!

916
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,958
That's what I thought when Grandpa died.

917
01:09:02,042 --> 01:09:05,792
<i>Godzilla entering Tanzawa Pass.
Only 500 meters to the trap point.</i>

918
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:21,792
Damn it, I'm running out of gas!

919
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,958
Keep provoking it
and lure it to the last point.

920
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,292
Stay calm, this is the critical moment.

921
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:30,708
<i>Trap point arrival, 100 meters!</i>

922
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:37,667
You will return Earth to humans.

923
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:39,958
Fifty more meters!

924
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:43,125
Damn, I can't stand this.

925
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:47,792
At times like this, I'm jealous of those
who have a god to pray to.

926
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:56,500
All units, disperse!

927
01:09:58,625 --> 01:09:59,625
<i>Ten meters!</i>

928
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:04,792
<i>Godzilla is at the trap point!</i>

929
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:06,792
Set off the trap!

930
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,625
<i>Trap detonation complete!</i>

931
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:24,792
Godzilla's movement stopped.

932
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:27,792
Did we succeed in capturing it?

933
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:37,958
Artillery unit, begin concentrated fire!

934
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,333
Asymmetrically permeable shield,
generated!

935
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,417
All gun ports, synchronized attack!

936
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:56,625
Body surface electromagnetic pulse
alignment sync at 75%!

937
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:59,833
At 75%? Is the pattern changing?

938
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:03,708
Alignment incomplete.
Unable to predict shield collapse!

939
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,583
Damn it, we can't attack like this.

940
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:08,625
Search for the noise. Hurry!

941
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:12,875
Noise detected.
The next shield collapse is in 20 seconds.

942
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:14,333
Twenty seconds?

943
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:16,125
Will the restraints hold?

944
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:24,167
Sync at 100%.

945
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:28,542
Detecting resonance with noise wave!
Shield collapse in ten seconds!

946
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,875
Artillery unit, fire!

947
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,292
If we can destroy the dorsal fin...

948
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,708
The shield is dropping!

949
01:11:47,292 --> 01:11:49,458
Electric potential rising!
It's an atomic breath!

950
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:53,083
It can still attack?

951
01:11:54,792 --> 01:11:57,625
The tissue on Godzilla's back
is regenerating!

952
01:11:57,958 --> 01:11:59,875
The shield will be restored.

953
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:02,667
Shield will be up in about 200 seconds!

954
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:05,208
The restraints are no longer holding!

955
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:06,917
Damn it.

956
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:08,667
I'll finish this!

957
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:11,458
Haruo!

958
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:20,125
- What is he...
- With a close-range EMP attack,

959
01:12:20,208 --> 01:12:22,250
he'll disrupt the noise pattern.

960
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:29,167
The pulse is changing. It's syncing again!

961
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:32,333
The next shield collapse
is in ten seconds!

962
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,792
Don't worry about me!
Destroy the rest of the dorsal fin!

963
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:37,208
But then you'll...

964
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,500
<i>Doesn't matter! Fire!</i>

965
01:12:40,292 --> 01:12:42,125
The shield is now collapsing!

966
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:47,208
Fire! Fire until the gun barrel burns up!

967
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,250
The shield is dropping!

968
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:55,417
Okay, power suit unit, attack!

969
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:12,375
The EMP probes are entering its body!

970
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,708
All units, retreat! Retreat!

971
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:34,958
Electromagnetic concentration
in the air, rising!

972
01:13:36,417 --> 01:13:38,292
It didn't work?

973
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:42,417
It did, the electromagnetic waves
are running wild inside it.

974
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:54,833
You bastard, I have...

975
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:59,750
killed you!

976
01:14:15,667 --> 01:14:17,958
He really did it.

977
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:17,917
Haruo!

978
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:34,000
Look at this.

979
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:38,208
This body structure...

980
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:42,333
Yeah. Indeed a monster.

981
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,542
You've accomplished it, Captain.

982
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:50,250
Because everyone believed in
and supported me,

983
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,750
I could be so daring and get this far.

984
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:58,792
Even though we defeated it...
What was it, really?

985
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:02,042
How was it able to live for 20,000 years?

986
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,042
This is just my opinion,

987
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:10,208
but I think this is a different Godzilla
than the one that drove us from Earth.

988
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:15,625
But its appearance and abilities
were almost identical.

989
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:19,375
And that's exactly why.
Life's true nature is found in change.

990
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:23,083
No matter how gradual
the renewal cycle may be,

991
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:26,792
it's impossible to maintain
the exact same appearance.

992
01:16:27,292 --> 01:16:31,750
So this one may be an offspring
that inherited Godzilla's form and nature.

993
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:34,875
Such a guess would actually
be the most natural.

994
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:40,167
Although the question remains
of why there was only this one. Also...

995
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:44,375
So, there's no guarantee
only one of them survived.

996
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:48,833
I apologize if what I'm saying
spoils the victory, but that is correct.

997
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:54,792
That's fine. Thanks to this battle,
we proved that we can defeat Godzilla.

998
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:58,708
Even if another one shows up,
we have nothing to fear.

999
01:16:59,667 --> 01:17:04,208
Since we've established a valid strategy,
we can be more effective next time.

1000
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:09,083
Personally, I would never want to cross
a tightrope like that ever again, though.

1001
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:13,083
What was that?

1002
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:16,125
Did anyone measure the vibration?

1003
01:17:16,208 --> 01:17:18,167
I'm picking it up on this sensor!

1004
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:22,042
Find the origin using Gematoria analysis.

1005
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:22,958
Yes, sir.

1006
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:27,500
No, it can't be. Is the meter damaged?

1007
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:30,458
- What is it?
- It's within two kilometers?

1008
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:31,583
It's nearby!

1009
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:32,833
That's ridiculous!

1010
01:17:32,917 --> 01:17:35,875
Electric potential, rising.
The numbers are unbelievable!

1011
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:38,125
They are far greater than Godzilla's!

1012
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:39,750
Underground heat source...

1013
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:43,042
Wait, a plasma reaction? This can't be!

1014
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:17,375
What's happening?

1015
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:32,792
Is that...

1016
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:39,708
Wh-What is that?

1017
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,083
Godzilla?

1018
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,833
Height over 300 meters and rising.

1019
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:48,375
Surface vibroscope estimates a mass
of about 100,000 tons.

1020
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:52,958
This is impossible!

1021
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,750
Can that be a living creature?
Unbelievable!

1022
01:19:13,167 --> 01:19:17,417
No, according to the rules
for living creatures, this is correct.

1023
01:19:18,042 --> 01:19:18,875
Professor?

1024
01:19:18,958 --> 01:19:23,958
Indeed, the changing form of life
isn't just about decay.

1025
01:19:24,917 --> 01:19:31,000
If it continued its life activity
for 20,000 years, growing earnestly...

1026
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:35,042
When those fleeting lives destined to die,

1027
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:38,042
forget their humbleness
and sing praises of their glory,

1028
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:41,625
such will shake the very heavens
and split the earth,

1029
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:44,167
and they shall know the wrath
of the divine.

1030
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,833
The inevitable incarnation of destruction.

1031
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,042
So, you show yourself at last.

1032
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:57,250
Since we last saw each other, it has been
20 years for us and 20,000 years for you.

1033
01:19:59,542 --> 01:20:00,958
It's been a while...

1034
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:03,667
Oh, King of Destruction.

1035
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:15,750
All landing ships, take off immediately!
Emergency retreat!

1036
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:17,792
But we're still withdrawing!

1037
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:21,625
Just take whoever's already onboard
before that thing attacks us!

1038
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,667
Everyone, do whatever it takes
to get far away from here! Hurry!

1039
01:21:07,667 --> 01:21:10,042
What's that? A super oscillatory wave?

1040
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:14,375
Estimated electric output
is measuring over 900 gigawatts.

1041
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,583
Damn it!

1042
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:17,667
What do you intend to do?

1043
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,042
I'll divert its attention!

1044
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,292
I'll buy time so people can run!

1045
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,583
You don't think that'll work, do you?

1046
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:39,833
You bastard... I will...

1047
01:22:40,534 --> 01:22:45,534
