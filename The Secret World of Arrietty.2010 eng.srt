2
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,810
I'll never forget that summer.

3
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,900
I spent a week in the old house
where my Mother grew up.

Yes.

The Secret World of Arrietty

10
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,500
Ah! How many times have I told
Haru not to block the driveway?

11
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,960
I'll be back in a sec.
Okay.

12
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,300
Haru!

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,300
You're blocking the driveway again.

14
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,230
Sho?

15
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,400
Where are you?

16
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,470
Don't touch!

17
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,600
These aren't for you.

18
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,000
Arrietty!!
Yes?

19
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,000
You been outside again?

20
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,590
And you might clean up
this room, young lady.

21
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,510
It's my own little garden.

22
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,300
If you were to ask me, looks
like a great big mess.

23
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,810
Oh! Look is that a bay leaf?

24
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,980
Ah! This means your birthday 
has come a little bit early.

25
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,030
That will do for a whole year.

26
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,040
The bay tree's so far away...

27
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,000
What if a human being saw you?
Please be careful..

28
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,710
I'm always careful.

29
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,670
The world is full of
dangerous creatures.

30
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,960
Your great uncle...

31
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,720
Was eaten by a toad,I know..

32
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,760
Don't these flowers smell just lovely?

33
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,680
So they do.

34
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,230
With a bit of sugar, I could
make some juice out of this.

35
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,900
Wait till tonight.I'll
borrow some for you.

36
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:01,440
What?!

37
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,910
It will be my first borrowing!
I've been practising night and day.

38
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,070
Father's home.

39
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,160
Hello Father...

40
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,710
Father, I want to ask you about...
I've seen a boy in the house.

41
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,865
What?!

42
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,380
I saw him too.

43
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,760
No! Arrietty...
There is no way! He couldn't have seen me!

44
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,930
I was safely hidden behind the bay leaf.
Father, are we still going borrowing this evening?

45
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,810
I won't hear of it.
It's too dangerous.

46
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,020
But he's only a boy!
It will be fine.

47
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,110
Father, I've been looking for it 
for this for so long.

48
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,360
Children can be more terrifying
than grown-ups.

49
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,280
It will be fine!

50
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,580
Young boy needs to go bed early.

51
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,120
oh Thank you, Father!

52
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,620
But Pod...

53
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,130
But this boy seems to be ill.
So you needn't worry.

54
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,630
But still...

55
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,130
It will be alright, Mother.
I will be extra careful.

56
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,760
Arrietty is going to be 14 soon...

57
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,890
She is going to have to learn to get by
the world with or without our help.

58
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,480
Sometimes I feel that we're the
last Borrowers left in the world.

59
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,430
And if there is anything you need,
just ask Haru to help you.

60
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,680
All right.

61
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,850
Haru, I'm depending on you.

62
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,810
Yes madam.

63
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,150
Let's pull down the screen.
Keep the bugs out.

64
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,570
Shouldn't you wear something
a bit darker?

65
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,740
No, this will be alright.

66
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,750
Try and remember to borrow
some tissue paper.

67
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,170
And even a cube of sugar, perhaps?

68
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,090
We could happen to sweeten the juice
as I should be serving tea later.

69
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,090
But only if you can.

70
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,930
We'll be back home soon.

71
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,510
Please be careful.

72
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,710
Ofcourse.

73
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,000
Arrietty! 

74
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,100
Bye...

75
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,320
Excuse me...

76
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,110
Arrietty would you hold these for me, please?
Yes Father.

77
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,070
Arrietty, hold on tight!

78
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,240
Arrietty?

79
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,570
Ready?
Yes

80
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,200
Ah Father! It's so big.

81
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,870
The world of the human beings.

82
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,000
The sugar's there in that pot.

83
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,630
Just wait here.

84
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,050
Father, you're great!

85
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,560
Now let's get that tissue.

86
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,000
Father, look.

87
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,830
and let that be your first borrowing.

88
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,290
But be careful, it's sharp.

89
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,670
Yes!

90
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Father, borrowing is such fun!

91
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,580
Look down there.

92
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,830
Rats. Stay clear of them.
They're trouble for us.

93
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,630
I'm not afraid.

94
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,300
If they were to come,
I will defend with this!

95
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,510
Sometimes it's best not to
go looking for danger.

96
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,480
What is this place?

97
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,440
Human being made it to
house all of their dolls.

98
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,160
Ah! This would be perfect for us!

99
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,410
I'm sure Mother would love
that dresser over there.

100
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,330
These things aren't for borrowing.

101
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,670
Anything goes missing, they'd know
right away, so don't tell your Mother.

102
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,670
Oh...

103
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,980
Don't need to be afraid of me.

104
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,500
Hey...

105
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,550
I saw you out in the garden today.

106
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,850
My Mother, she told me about you.

107
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,680
She saw little people here
when she was young.

108
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,190
Was it you she saw?

109
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,980
Was it?

110
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,410
I'm so sorry, Father.

111
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,240
The boy saw me outside the garden today.

112
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,250
I should've been a bit more careful.

113
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,080
I hope he didn't frighten you.

114
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,090
But it's the best to not tell your
Mother. It will only worry her.

115
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,590
All right.

116
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:16,600
You don't always have to run. Take
the time to watch first then decide.

117
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,950
We're back.

118
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,870
Safe and sound.

119
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,800
Something wrong?

120
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,140
Things didn't go well this time.

121
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,600
This light gave out so we have
make out way back early.

122
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,770
Oh dear.

123
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,480
It meant we couldn't get your sugar.

124
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,480
Not to worry. At least you're
home, safe and sound.

125
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,950
Arrietty, you found something. Show
your Mother your very first borrowing.

126
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,870
What a pretty pin.

127
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,000
Time for bed.

128
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,680
Well, Good night then.

129
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,190
She looks completely worn out.

130
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,860
Shall I make us some tea?

131
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,510
Sho!

132
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,850
Come in the house.
You'll catch cold out there.

133
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,140
What? A cube of sugar?
Where was it?

134
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,060
It was left by the grating.

135
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,570
It's probably the same one
I dropped last night.

136
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,240
What?

137
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,070
What do you mean,
you dropped it?

138
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,250
Don't touch it, Arrietty.
Is that understood?

139
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,250
It's a trap.

140
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,630
They're gonna track us and
then try to catch us!

141
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,420
We'll have to stop borrowing
for a while.

142
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,180
Maybe they already
know where we are.

143
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,260
Pod, we'll have to move!

144
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,930
Ah!This was such a lovely house.

145
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,440
Now we'll have to start again.

146
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,270
Well, shall we see how things go?

147
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,610
Now eat, soup's getting cold.

148
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,780
Ah! Why did it have to be the sugar?

149
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,050
Thank you Arrietty.

150
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,310
I wanted to hang the clothes
while the sun's up.

151
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,980
It's pleasure. I love doing laundry.

152
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,650
I'm going to take a little nap, see you later.
Alright.

153
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,320
"You forgot something"

154
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,280
So you came back to me.

155
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,120
Hey..please..don't go.

156
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,300
You have to leave us alone.

157
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,130
I just wanted to tell you that.

158
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,300
I want to talk to you.

159
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,800
Human beings are dangerous.

160
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,140
If we're found, we have to move away.
My parents told me so.

161
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,310
So you have your family then?
I envy you.

162
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,610
You don't have one?

163
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,650
I suppose I do but I
never see my Father.

164
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,660
My mother is always working and
barely has time for me.

165
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,160
Is that so?...

166
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,830
I would really like to know your name.
You can call me Sho.

167
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,550
Do you even have one?
Well do you?

168
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,920
Of course I have a name!

169
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,840
It's Arrietty.

170
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,850
Arrietty... Arrietty...

171
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,850
That's a really pretty name.

172
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,580
Would it be possibly to see you?
Even if just for a moment.

173
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,960
Ah just a little peek. Ah please?

174
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,230
What's going on in here?
Arrghh!

175
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,190
Can't come in here!
Get out!

176
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,130
What got into that bird?
I never seen one behave like that before.

177
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,420
Perhaps it's time for
their nesting season.

178
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,220
Now I have to replace this screen.
Where do we keep them?

179
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,640
Are you all right?

180
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,810
Master Sho it's high time that...
you should take your medicine now.

181
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,650
Thank you, Haru.

182
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,480
I really feel fine, thanks.

183
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,830
The nesting season, eh?

184
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,090
Have yourself a lovely long rest.

185
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,900
Father...

186
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,900
I told you to stay away.
I'm sorry.

187
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,990
I thought I should take
care of it myself.

188
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,700
Father, he really didn't see me.

189
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,040
Your action put your family in danger.

190
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,090
I won't say it again.
Understood?

191
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,420
Yes.

192
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,720
I think it's time to start looking.
Huh?

193
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,650
For a new home.

194
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,150
Oh! Pod...

195
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,960
"You forgot something"

196
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,190
Hello! Got a package for you.

197
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,650
Thanks alot for the drink.
It's really hot today.

198
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,400
Do you know of any good pest
control companies around there?

199
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,490
Oh! Let's have a look.

200
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,500
Here's one! Squeaky Clean Services.
Pest control.

201
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,330
Squeaky Clean Services?
I'll write it down.

202
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,500
You having problems with mice?

203
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,680
Maybe it's mice or maybe it's
something more interesting.

204
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,360
Eh?

205
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,180
Between you and me, it's little people.

206
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,020
I've seen them myself.

207
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,940
I hear a crow tried to
fly into your room?

208
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,070
I hope it didn't scare you.

209
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,870
I am fine, Aunt Sadako.
Haru chased it out away.

210
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,700
I never seen anything like it.

211
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,210
A huge great beast of a crow...

212
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:44,880
Excitement's is the worst possible
thing in the world for his heart.

213
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,170
Haru, Sho came here for
some peace and quiet.

214
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,220
If anything were to happen
before the operation...

215
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,550
Ofcourse Madam.

216
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,060
Gracious! I realize Sho's mother's
work is terribly important...

217
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,270
but to go abroad on business and
leave a sick child behind?

218
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:08,070
It never easy for a young boy
to be without his mother.

219
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,780
You shouldn't worry
about it I don't mind.

220
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,070
I suppose the divorce was inevitable.

221
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:18,740
But why can't she be here,
when her only child needs her?

222
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,500
Aunt Sadako, who made that
little wooden house in my room?

223
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,210
Looks amazing.

224
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,420
Oh! You mean the dolls house?

225
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,760
It belonged to your mother
when she was a small child.

226
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:41,270
She had to leave it here years
ago when she moved away.

227
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
It was mum's?

228
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,900
My father had it made specialy to order...

229
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,650
As a place for all little people to live in.
Little?

230
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,070
Father always said he saw
little people in our home.

231
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,280
He waited years in the hope
of seeing them again.

232
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:01,550
He always said that house
was a present for them.

233
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,460
I'm afraid they never
showed themselves again.

234
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,790
Not in my father's lifetime,
regrettably not in mine.

235
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,920
Master Sho, I suppose you didn't see
any little people in your room?

236
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,470
Hmm..Unfortunately... not.

237
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,640
The dolls house has been passed
down from my Father...

238
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,150
Sure your mother will be very
happy for you to have it now.

239
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,810
Do you mean that?

240
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,360
Yes.

241
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,280
Have you looked inside?
It's really quite beautiful!

242
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,400
Haru, would you be so kind enough
to please turn off the lights?

243
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Yes'm.

244
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,180
This is the living room.

245
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:04,180
All the furnishings were hand made
by a real furniture maker.

246
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,930
Beautiful don't you think?

247
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,480
Here's the library on the first floor.
There's even a study!

248
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:18,200
Wait until you see the next room
It's my personal favourite.

249
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,030
Haru, would you be so kind...

250
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,200
Quite certainly.
I think it opens this way.

251
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,710
It's wonderful!

252
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,210
It's perfectly detailed and
just like the real thing.

253
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,510
even th oven works.
You could use it for baking.

254
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,720
Ah.. It's beautiful!

255
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,720
It's a pity father's dream
never came true.

256
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,190
And it's been so Long...

257
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,990
Maybe the little people
are gone now.

258
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,330
Mother, we've had these
pictures three years.

259
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,870
Can't we change them?

260
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,870
I truly love those pictures.

261
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,050
I've always dreamed one day
I'd see the real ocean.

262
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,170
Anyway, there's no point to
changing them now.

263
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,390
Father's a bit late.

264
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,560
I hope he didn't get caught
in that downpour.

265
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:44,070
It's Father!
Sounds like he's in the back door.

266
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,410
Father! Are you ok?

267
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,240
I've twisted my leg.

268
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,750
Lucky Spiller here helped me.

269
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,090
Pod?

270
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,760
Oh dear, you're hurt!
Hurry, bring him in.

271
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,260
Does it hurt?

272
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,760
It's not broken.
I'll be fine in no time.

273
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,100
Come in. I'll get you
some cold water.

274
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,610
Here's a towel. Dry yourself.

275
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:24,770
Who are you?

276
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,120
I knew it. It's not just the
three of us after all.

277
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,960
I go home.

278
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,130
Please don't. Stay with us.
Have some tea.

279
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,810
Why don't I attend to your Father.
And you get Spiller a cup of tea.

280
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,410
Ofcourse.

281
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,980
Thank you Spiller.
Father's so lucky you came along.

282
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,820
We're so indebted to you.

283
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,160
Spiller, have you seen
other Borrowers?

284
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,330
You see, we thought we might be the
only ones left in the whole world.

285
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,120
I think this many.

286
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,750
Ah! Then Cousin Lupy must be alright!

287
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,510
Is that a bow your have?
Can I look?

288
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,510
And you use this for borrowing?

289
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,520
Give that back,Arrietty.
It's not a toy.

290
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,520
Give!

291
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,870
Gotta go.

292
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,670
But..but we just about to eat
something. You like to join us?

293
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,880
You eat this?

294
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,050
Cricket's leg!

295
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,970
Want some? It's real good.

296
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,060
No thank you!

297
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:27,770
Get well.

298
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,900
I thank you again.

299
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,240
I'll see him out.

300
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,250
Did you go looking for a new home then?

301
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:50,460
After I tripped and fell in the woods.
I couldn't move until Spiller found me.

302
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,260
You were lucky.

303
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,930
Spiller knows the land on the other
side of the river really well...

304
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,640
he told me he knows a few places that
we can look to build our new home.

305
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,520
That's good I suppose.

306
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,940
I'm not looking forward
to sleeping rough.

307
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:12,530
I wonder if we'll find anything
as nice as this though.

308
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:19,780
I'm glad there is more like us.
It's make me feel better.

309
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,910
Spiller, do you live home with your family?

310
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,290
Family? No, just me.

311
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,290
Alright, please come visit us again.

312
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:32,630
My mother's makes really amazing stew.
Okay.

313
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,360
Haru?

314
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,010
Arrietty, your stitches
need to be neater.

315
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,720
You'll have to start over.

316
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,620
Huh?

317
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,390
What? What's this big bag for?
Why do we need it?

318
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:18,900
I think I'll go and see how father is.

319
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,070
Father, may I come in?

320
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,040
How's your leg?

321
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,410
Ah! I'll be walking very soon.

322
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,750
Father?

323
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,040
Are we going to move away?

324
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:40,760
Human being have seen us.
We've no choice but to move.

325
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,350
I don't think that every
human being is dangerous.

326
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,100
Arrietty...

327
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:55,940
Long before you were born, there were
two other families living in this house.

328
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:59,110
One of them just went missing,
they just disappeared.

329
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,440
The other one moved away.

330
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,740
They were seen by human beings.

331
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,620
No matter what happens,
this family must survive.

332
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,790
Father...

333
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:29,720
oh my.. what's happening? Earthquake?

334
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:55,620
Mother!

335
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,630
It won't open.

336
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,760
The frame's buckled.

337
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,870
Not the wall!

338
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,240
Homily!

339
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,570
Homily!

340
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,910
I always dreamed
of having a kitchen like this.

341
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,810
Gather only the things we need.

342
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:32,950
We won't be able to carry all that.

343
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,830
And Homily, take nothing
from the doll house, please.

344
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I'll go ahead and make sure it's safe.

345
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,290
Stay with your Mother.
Yes.

346
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,200
You finally came back.

347
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,010
So, what do you think of the new kitchen?

348
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,010
Our house is in a really big mess.

349
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:40,390
But it doesn't matter.
I came to say goodbye today.

350
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,900
Can I look at you?

351
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,710
Beautiful.

352
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:18,050
We are going to move away from you.

353
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,930
We've been seen by human beings.

354
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,770
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.

355
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,270
Borrowers...?

356
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:28,770
We borrow from human beings.

357
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:31,400
We take things we need, they won't miss.

358
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,780
Soap, cookies, sugar, electricity and gas too.

359
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,530
Even my great-grandfather
was a Borrower.

360
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,120
And nobody seen them? Never?

361
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,120
Probably.

362
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,130
I think this is all my fault.

363
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,130
Niya, don't be like that.
Be nice to her.

364
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:00,640
Arrietty, are there other little people
like you living hidden away in the house?

365
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:04,640
No, it's just my father, mother and I.

366
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,980
What about elsewhere?

367
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:10,980
I'm sure there's more.
But I've only met one so far.

368
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:12,690
Oh.

369
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:17,450
So, one day you might be the only one left.

370
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,420
Every year you get less and less...

371
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:25,490
that would mean you're a doomed species.

372
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,330
That's not true!

373
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:32,880
There's lots more of us.
Spiller said so!

374
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,500
Spiller?

375
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,670
He's one of us.

376
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:40,180
And spiller says there's
many more of us out there.

377
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,270
Do you have any idea, how many people
there are living in the world?

378
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:50,350
6.7 billion

379
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,650
6.7 billion?

380
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,480
And how many of you?

381
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,860
I don't know.

382
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,030
There's probably just a few of you left.

383
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:05,370
Before my mother told me, I didn't
know that borrowers even existed.

384
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:11,040
There are so many rare species
that have already died out...

385
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:14,710
I've only read about them
in my school books, though.

386
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:18,170
So many beautiful creatures...

387
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:22,010
Ended dying out as the environment changes.

388
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:27,060
It's sad, but maybe that's whats
fate has for the borrowers.

389
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,180
Fate, you say?

390
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:35,400
You're the one who changed things. And
we are the one to have to move away!

391
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:39,530
Father said that we must to survive by all means.

392
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:42,530
So we're moving away even though it's dangerous.

393
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:48,910
We make do, we always have. You don't know
anything about us! But we'll survive this.

394
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:52,620
And we'll not simply died out!

395
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,210
I'm sorry. You're right ofcourse.

396
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,550
In fact, I'm the one who's going to die out.

397
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,850
What?!

398
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,560
It's my heart.

399
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,770
They're going to operate next
week but it's hopeless.

400
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,440
Your heart...?

401
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:20,110
I've been sick since I was a child.
I could never play with other kids.

402
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:25,280
When I saw you, I wanted to
protect you. But I failed.

403
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,780
I can't even do that.

404
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:30,830
I hope that you can forgive me.

405
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:35,330
Your illness is really that bad?

406
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,280
What on Earth is this doing in here?

407
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:32,350
The kitchen from the dolls house!

408
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,530
I found you!

409
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,330
What is it?

410
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,130
My Mother... I heard her voice.

411
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,580
This really is a great kitchen.

412
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,460
You're not the only one here, I bet.

413
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:02,770
I have to go.

414
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:54,030
Let me out! Help me!

415
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:04,060
The ceiling's been moved.

416
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,480
Hello? Hello? Squeaky Clean Services?
Yeah, that is us.

417
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:36,110
Can you make an urgent house call?
Yeah sure.

418
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,400
We've something small in
the house but not mice.

419
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:40,860
Not mice?

420
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:43,160
I don't want them killed.

421
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:44,870
You need trapping services?

422
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:48,210
Yes, I want you to trap them.

423
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:00,840
Sho! Sho!

424
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:01,840
Sho!

425
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:05,680
Arrietty!

426
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,900
My mother's gone!

427
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:18,030
Someone took the roof off.
I think a human being got her!

428
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,450
Mother...

429
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,090
I will help you find her.

430
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:14,040
Someones locked the door!

431
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:20,260
Let's try the room next door.

432
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,070
It won't budge.

433
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:42,440
Wait!

434
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:53,790
Here's a way in.

435
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,330
Amazing!

436
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,200
No, that's not it.

437
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:12,370
Further down the road, there's a
dirt track. Turn in there.

438
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:16,040
Before the bridge?
No, no, after it.

439
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:26,090
Haru's opened this.

440
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:29,550
Then Haru must've taken
Mother someplace.

441
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,710
Are you alright?

442
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:20,440
oh dear oh Dear, What's taking them so long?

443
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:56,720
Mother! Where are you?

444
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:15,160
But I locked the...

445
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:16,830
Lock?

446
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,500
Could I have some hot milk please?

447
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:24,540
Yes ofcourse, ofcourse.. just a moment.

448
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,340
Thanks so much.

449
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:16,720
So hungry. Do you have any cookies?

450
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,520
Just a sec!

451
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:24,230
Mother!

452
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:27,350
Mother!

453
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,450
Mother?
Arrietty!

454
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,870
Here I am, Here I am Arrietty!

455
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,250
I'm up here Mother!

456
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,090
Arrietty!

457
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:25,620
Oh what now? They finally found
the right road. Nincompoops!

458
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:48,810
Ah!! Another human being!

459
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:54,320
Mother, it's okay.

460
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:20,680
We'd like to take a look around the
house first if that's alright by you.

461
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:22,340
Take your time.

462
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:49,410
Now who could be spraying that?

463
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,710
Haru? Haru!

464
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:53,810
Madam!

465
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,710
What are they doing here?

466
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,720
Dear maddam, the little people are here!

467
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,340
Little people?

468
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:04,720
Yes.

469
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:07,390
Little people who steal.

470
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,570
Is it true?
Really!

471
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:29,870
They steal things from
all over the house.

472
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,210
That's why so much
was going missing.

473
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,250
Haru, what's gotten into you?

474
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,460
All this time I thought
it was my imagination.

475
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:41,590
Well, it wasn't.

476
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:45,890
You certainly didn't need
to call pest control.

477
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:50,390
We'd better hurry.
The house is full of them!

478
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,390
You'll believe me
when you see this.

479
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:57,310
This is their nest.

480
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,780
Nest?

481
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,450
It looks like a pile
of old junk to me.

482
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:16,520
What? what happened? I swear I saw it..
I swear..

483
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,880
Haru! I'm sending the
pest controllers away!

484
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,590
Now, wait just a minute.

485
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,050
The doll house!

486
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,600
Master Sho, may we come in?

487
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:37,980
Ofcourse.

488
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:52,740
Hard to believe, they stole
the little kitchen.

489
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,120
You'll see, it's gone.

490
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,000
It's not gone.

491
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:04,510
This kitchen, it looks so nice.

492
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:21,520
Please.. please.. wait madam.
I caught one in a jar!

493
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:27,530
That's strange. I wonder
what's troubling Haru.

494
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:29,030
Hmm?

495
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,540
What wonderful fresh herbs!

496
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:50,680
Ah! Someone's been making tea!

497
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:57,060
It's just as my father said.
There are little people living here.

498
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:01,560
Yes, there are.

499
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:05,020
So Haru really did see them?

500
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:07,690
Though she accused them of stealing.

501
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:11,410
They weren't thieves at all!
They were Borrowers!

502
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:12,810
Sorry?

503
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,080
I mean, I wish
I could see them.

504
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,580
I sure they're here somewhere.

505
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,590
I think so too.

506
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:43,480
Madam? Excuse me, madam!

507
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:46,270
Is there any place you
like us to start?

508
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:56,620
Are you alright?

509
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:01,290
They got out.

510
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:04,130
I had it right in here!

511
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:07,960
It's not just my imagination.
There are little people!

512
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:11,760
I'll get them next time I swear!

513
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:30,490
How far is it where we
are meeting Spiller?

514
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:35,160
It's just end of this wood.
Then we head down the river.

515
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:41,160
I'm so..so..I'll never make it.

516
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:42,270
Shh!

517
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,010
Let's move.

518
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,020
I can't do it...

519
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:32,050
Better have something to eat now.
We'll be walking till sunrise.

520
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,340
Huh?

521
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:36,720
I'm sorry.

522
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:42,390
We had to leave our lovely house
because of my stupid selfishness.

523
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:48,230
That's in the past.

524
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:53,400
We'll make another lovely house,
with the three of us together.

525
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:01,410
I'm going outside for some air.

526
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:04,750
Don't stray too far.

527
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,450
It's Niya!

528
01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:52,850
Niya...

529
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:58,350
Niya?

530
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:13,540
Just a little further.

531
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,900
Spiller!

532
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,420
That's everything.

533
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,750
Now let's get moving.

534
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,250
Okay.

535
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,930
Mother, you alright?

536
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:19,440
Arrietty!

537
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:50,970
Sho!

538
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,310
Arrietty...

539
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:17,670
We're just about to leave.

540
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:24,510
I'm glad I got here in time.

541
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:30,680
Niya showed me the way.

542
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:41,190
Thank you. Look after yourself.

543
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,990
I brought this.

544
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:58,210
I would be very happy if you
could accept it this time.

545
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,380
Oh! Thank you.

546
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:21,400
I must go now.

547
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:24,570
When's your operation?

548
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,900
In two days.

549
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:31,570
I'll be okay. It's you that's 
given me the courage to live.

550
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,920
It will bring you luck.

551
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,090
Thanks.

552
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:57,600
Thank you for having protected me.

553
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,440
Arrietty...

554
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:06,770
You take care of yourself.

555
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,610
Goodbye.

556
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:19,120
Arrietty, you're in my heart
for now and for always.

557
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:22,790
I'll never forget you, ever.
