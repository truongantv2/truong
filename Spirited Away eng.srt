1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:44,500


2
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:47,889
Good luck, Chihiro
Hope we meet again

3
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:50,892
Chihiro? Chihiro!

4
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:52,561
We're almost there.

5
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,482
This really is the middle of nowhere.

6
00:00:57,608 --> 00:01:00,402
I'll have to shop in the next town.

7
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,612
We'll just have to make do.

8
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:07,034
Look, there's the elementary school.

9
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,952
That's your new school, Chihiro.

10
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:12,080
Why, it looks very nice.

11
00:01:19,797 --> 00:01:21,923
I liked my old school.

12
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:28,972
Mom, my flowers got bent.

13
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:31,683
No wonder,
the way you squeeze them.

14
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:34,770
A little water
and they'll perk right up.

15
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:39,399
My first bouquet,
and it's farewell flowers.

16
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:42,986
What about the rose
you got for your birthday?

17
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:46,114
One rose?
One rose isn't a bouquet.

18
00:01:46,282 --> 00:01:47,908
You dropped the card.

19
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:52,412
Now pull yourself together.
This is a busy day for us.

20
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:16,812
SPIRITED AWAY

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,161
Wait a minute.
Did I take a wrong turn?

22
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,080
I don't get it.

23
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:37,332
That must be it up there.

24
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,210
The blue one on the end.

25
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:41,962
That's it.

26
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:45,048
I guess I turned off too soon.

27
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,175
Maybe if we go straight?

28
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:49,845
Oh, please.
That's how we always get lost.

29
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:51,972
Let's just see what's up here.

30
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,017
- What are those things?
- Houses for the guardian spirits.

31
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,484
Dad, are you sure?

32
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,195
Don't worry, we've got 4-wheel drive.

33
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:09,156
Sit down, Chihiro.

34
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,636
What are you doing? Slow down!

35
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,472
There's a tunnel.

36
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,655
What's this building?

37
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:52,616
It looks like a gate.

38
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:56,578
Honey, I think we should go back.

39
00:03:57,246 --> 00:03:58,622
Chihiro!

40
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,124
Honestly...

41
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,877
Look at this, it's just plaster.

42
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:06,087
This thing's pretty new.

43
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:17,599
The air's blowing in.

44
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:19,184
What is it?

45
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,603
Let's see what's on the other side.

46
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,356
It's creepy, Dad.
Can't we go back?

47
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:28,777
Don't be such a chicken.
C'mon, let's take a look.

48
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:31,112
The movers will be there soon.

49
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:35,283
So? They've got the keys.
They'll handle everything.

50
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,451
I know, but...

51
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,536
No! I won't go.

52
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:42,582
Dad, let's go.

53
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,167
Come on, it'll be fun.

54
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:46,002
I'm staying here!

55
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:56,763
Chihiro, you wait in the car.

56
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:00,600
Mom...

57
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,895
Wait up!

58
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,069
Watch your step.

59
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:14,531
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.

60
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:49,858
- What is this?
- Wait, hear that?

61
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,536
- A train.
- Maybe we're near a station.

62
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:03,538
Let's find out.
It must be close.

63
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:42,494
Houses, way out here?

64
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,245
I knew it.

65
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:47,415
It's an abandoned theme park.

66
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,587
They built lots of them
back in the nineties.

67
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:55,256
But they went bust
when the economy tanked.

68
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:57,926
This must be one of them.

69
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,011
Wait, where are we going?

70
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:02,764
Let's go back, Dad.

71
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,394
Please!

72
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:19,906
Mom, that building's moaning.

73
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:21,241
It's just the wind.

74
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:26,246
What a lovely spot.
We should've brought the sandwiches.

75
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,126
This would've been a river.

76
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,258
Do you smell something?

77
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:42,178
- Something smells good.
- You're right.

78
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:45,098
Maybe they're open
for business after all.

79
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:46,975
Hurry up, Chihiro.

80
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:49,185
Wait for me!

81
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:23,636
This way.

82
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:31,186
Can you believe it?
Nothing but restaurants.

83
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:33,521
There's nobody here.

84
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,484
Over there.

85
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,823
Come on!

86
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,544
Come take a look.

87
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:01,299
This is amazing.

88
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:04,344
Hello, is anybody here?

89
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,888
Come on, Chihiro.
It looks delicious.

90
00:09:07,264 --> 00:09:08,348
You got customers!

91
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:16,814
Don't worry.
We'll pay when they show up.

92
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:19,484
You're right.
Let's see now...

93
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,736
What kind of bird is this?

94
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:26,366
It's delicious! Chihiro, try some.

95
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:27,867
I don't want any.

96
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:30,995
Can't we go?
They'll be mad at us.

97
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:34,415
Don't worry, your father's here.

98
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,709
I've got credit cards and cash.

99
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,383
Have some, Chihiro.
It's very tender.

100
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,095
- Mustard.
- Thanks.

101
00:09:57,815 --> 00:10:00,483
Mom! Dad!

102
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,387
What a weird building.

103
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:42,919
A train!

104
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,390
You can't be here.
Go now!

105
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:59,394
It's almost sundown.
Go before it gets dark!

106
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:04,190
They're lighting the lamps.
Come on!

107
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:06,901
I'll hold them off.
Get across the river!

108
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,251
What's his problem?

109
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:32,969
Dad?

110
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:35,596
Dad, let's go home.

111
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:37,473
Let's go, Dad!

112
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,752
Dad!

113
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,295
Mom!

114
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,765
Mommy!

115
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:41,829
Water!

116
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:56,511
No...

117
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,387
It's just a dream.

118
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:03,267
Wake up, wake up.
Wake up!

119
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:06,270
Please wake up.

120
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:14,028
It's just a dream, a stupid dream.

121
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:17,114
Go away, disappear.

122
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:18,908
Disappear.

123
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:28,417
I'm fading away!

124
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,673
This has to be a dream.

125
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,769
Don't be afraid.
I'm a friend.

126
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:30,938
No, no, no!

127
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:33,065
Open your mouth. Eat this.

128
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:36,027
Unless you eat something
from this world, you'll disappear.

129
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:37,445
No!

130
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:44,619
Don't worry.
You won't turn into a pig.

131
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,621
Chew it and swallow.

132
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,633
Good, now you'll be fine.

133
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,468
See for yourself.

134
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:09,936
I can touch you.

135
00:16:10,062 --> 00:16:12,355
Of course.
Now come.

136
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:16,484
Where's Mom and Dad?
Did they really turn into pigs?

137
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:19,236
You can't see them now,
but you will.

138
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:23,532
Quiet!

139
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:44,887
It's looking for you.
There's no time, let's run.

140
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,683
I can't stand up.
What should I do?

141
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:52,728
- My legs don't work.
- Relax and take a deep breath.

142
00:16:56,358 --> 00:17:00,611
In the name of the wind and
water within, unbind her.

143
00:17:00,862 --> 00:17:01,862
Stand up!

144
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,116
Don't breathe while we're on the bridge.

145
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:53,497
One tiny breath will break my spell.
We don't want anyone to see you.

146
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:00,212
I'm scared.

147
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:01,881
Be calm.

148
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:05,051
Welcome, your presence honors us.

149
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:07,386
Greetings, welcome.

150
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:10,890
- I've finished my rounds.
- Welcome back, sir.

151
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,851
Take a deep breath.

152
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,103
Hold it.

153
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:36,791
Welcome back.
We've been waiting for you.

154
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:39,877
Just a little further.

155
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,379
Master Haku!

156
00:18:43,131 --> 00:18:44,757
Where have you...

157
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:47,968
A human?

158
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:50,096
Run!

159
00:19:06,655 --> 00:19:08,948
Master Haku, Master Haku!

160
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:11,700
I smell something.
A human intruder!

161
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:14,078
I smell humans!
The stench of humans!

162
00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:16,872
- They know you're here.
- Sorry, I messed up.

163
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:19,166
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

164
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:21,919
Now listen.
I'll tell you what to do.

165
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:23,671
If you stay here, they'll find you.

166
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:27,633
I'll distract them while you get away.

167
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:30,177
No, don't go!
Stay with me, please.

168
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:33,848
You have no choice,
if you want to survive here...

169
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:35,683
and save your parents, too.

170
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:39,353
So I wasn't dreaming.
They did turn into pigs.

171
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:40,938
Listen carefully.

172
00:19:41,857 --> 00:19:45,317
After I'm gone,
go through the back gate.

173
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:48,320
Take the stairs
all the way down.

174
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,573
You'll find
the boiler room where...

175
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:52,199
they stoke the fires.

176
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:55,661
Look for Kamaji.

177
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:57,163
Kamaji?

178
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:00,624
Ask him for work.

179
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,418
If he refuses, keep asking.

180
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:06,422
If you don't work,
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

181
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:08,048
Yubaba?

182
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:10,926
She's the sorceress who rules our world.

183
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:14,471
She'll try to trick you into leaving...

184
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:16,182
but keep asking for work.

185
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:21,145
The work's hard, but it will protect you.
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.

186
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:25,191
Master Haku, Master Haku!

187
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:26,609
I have to go.

188
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:30,946
- Remember I'm your friend, Chihiro.
- How did you know my name?

189
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:33,449
You told me long ago.

190
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:35,701
My name is Haku.

191
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,414
Here I am!

192
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:44,627
Master Haku, Yubaba's waiting.

193
00:20:44,753 --> 00:20:47,755
I know, I've been searching too.

194
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,796
Um...

195
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:00,007
Excuse me.

196
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:08,182
Um...

197
00:25:14,898 --> 00:25:17,232
Are you Kamaji?

198
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:28,702
Haku sent me.
Please let me work here.

199
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:36,543
What, all at once?

200
00:25:37,212 --> 00:25:39,463
Get to work, you little runts!

201
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:45,928
I am Kamaji, slave to the boilers
that heat the baths.

202
00:25:46,054 --> 00:25:48,222
Step on it, boys!

203
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,475
Please let me work here.

204
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:55,854
I've got all the help I need.
There's soot everywhere.

205
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,899
I'll never run out of help.

206
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:15,332
Oh, I'm sorry.

207
00:26:19,003 --> 00:26:21,088
Wait a second.

208
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,434
Out of the way.

209
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:29,740
Wait, what do I do with this?

210
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:38,123
Do I leave it here?

211
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:40,626
Finish what you start.

212
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:44,064
Get to work, runts!
Wanna turn back into soot?

213
00:28:44,232 --> 00:28:47,901
And you, better watch it.
You can't just take someone's work.

214
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:51,571
If they don't work,
their spell will be broken.

215
00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:54,825
There's no work for you here.
Try somewhere else.

216
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:06,336
You sootballs got a problem?

217
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:07,963
Get to work!

218
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:10,632
Chow time!

219
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:13,343
What, you guys at it again?

220
00:29:15,263 --> 00:29:18,181
Give it a rest.
Where's your bowl?

221
00:29:19,142 --> 00:29:21,143
I keep telling you to leave it out.

222
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:23,937
Food's here.
Break time!

223
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:41,663
The human! You're gonna catch it.

224
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:43,999
They're having a fit about it upstairs.

225
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:47,002
She's my granddaughter.

226
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:48,587
Your granddaughter!

227
00:29:49,464 --> 00:29:53,175
She says she wants work,
but I don't need any help.

228
00:29:53,301 --> 00:29:56,803
Could you take her
to Yubaba for me?

229
00:29:56,971 --> 00:29:58,764
This girl can handle herself.

230
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,308
Not a chance.
Yubaba would kill me.

231
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:06,229
Not even for this?
Charcoal-roasted newt, finest quality.

232
00:30:08,357 --> 00:30:12,319
If you want work, you have to
sign a contract with Yubaba.

233
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:14,654
Might as well try your luck.

234
00:30:15,823 --> 00:30:18,658
Fine!
You there, follow me.

235
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,501
What about
"Yes, ma'am" or "Thank you"?

236
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:29,002
Yes, ma'am.

237
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,504
What a klutz.
Move it!

238
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,588
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:30:34,217 --> 00:30:37,260
Leave the shoes.
And the socks!

240
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:38,553
Yes'm.

241
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:47,979
Aren't you going to thank Kamaji?
He's looking out for you.

242
00:30:50,191 --> 00:30:52,150
Thank you very much.

243
00:30:53,611 --> 00:30:54,986
Good luck.

244
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:07,541
Yubaba lives on
the top floor in the back.

245
00:31:22,056 --> 00:31:24,391
Move it, will you?

246
00:31:28,688 --> 00:31:30,272
You'll lose your nose.

247
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:57,799
- One more elevator after this.
- Yes'm.

248
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:03,430
We're here.

249
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:08,143
Welcome, sir!

250
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:18,528
This elevator stops here.
Please use another one.

251
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,678
- He's following us.
- Quit gawking.

252
00:32:58,986 --> 00:33:01,363
Here we are.

253
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:08,620
Your room is on the right.

254
00:33:11,332 --> 00:33:13,625
- Lin?
- Yes sir!

255
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:16,962
Something smells.

256
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:19,798
It's human.
You reek of human.

257
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:21,257
Is that so?

258
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:24,719
I smell it, I do.
Smells mighty tasty, too.

259
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:27,722
You're hiding something.

260
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:30,183
Tell me the truth.

261
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:31,601
Maybe it's this.

262
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:34,354
Roasted newt? Give it here!

263
00:33:34,522 --> 00:33:37,732
Not a chance.
The girls asked me to get it.

264
00:33:37,984 --> 00:33:40,986
I'm begging you.
I'll settle for a leg.

265
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:44,990
Pull the lever to go up, sir.

266
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:32,347
Can't you even knock?

267
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,101
What a plain little girl.

268
00:35:46,362 --> 00:35:48,363
Now, come.

269
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:53,743
I said, come!

270
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,468
Ow...

271
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:23,690
What a racket.
Could you be quiet?

272
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,835
Please...

273
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:46,337
Let me work here.

274
00:36:54,805 --> 00:36:57,891
Stop your babbling.

275
00:36:58,017 --> 00:37:01,311
Why do I need
a weakling like you?

276
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:05,815
Besides, this is no place for humans.

277
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:09,319
Millions of spirits come here...

278
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:13,281
to purge themselves of toil and care.

279
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,410
Your parents, my goodness!
They certainly had some nerve.

280
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:21,122
Gobbling our guests' food
like a couple of pigs.

281
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:23,374
Just deserts, I'd say.

282
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:29,214
And as for you, you'll never
see your world again either.

283
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:35,762
You'd make a lovely piglet.

284
00:37:36,096 --> 00:37:38,973
Or perhaps a lump of coal?

285
00:37:46,774 --> 00:37:48,358
Trembling, aren't you?

286
00:37:48,484 --> 00:37:52,111
Still, I'm impressed
you made it this far.

287
00:37:52,238 --> 00:37:55,490
Someone must've helped you.

288
00:37:55,783 --> 00:37:57,867
I must thank your friend.

289
00:37:57,993 --> 00:38:02,622
Just who was it, my dear?
You can tell me.

290
00:38:05,626 --> 00:38:07,168
Please let me work here!

291
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:08,836
Not that again!

292
00:38:08,963 --> 00:38:10,380
I want to work here!

293
00:38:10,714 --> 00:38:15,635
Shut your mouth!

294
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:23,059
Why on earth should I hire you?

295
00:38:23,185 --> 00:38:27,480
Anyone can see you're
a lazy, spoiled, stupid crybaby.

296
00:38:27,648 --> 00:38:32,652
What job would I possibly have
for someone like you?

297
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:38,658
You're wasting your time.
I've got all the bums I need.

298
00:38:39,576 --> 00:38:43,830
Or maybe I'll give you
the nastiest job I've got...

299
00:38:43,956 --> 00:38:45,999
and work you night and day...

300
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:51,045
until you breathe your very last breath!

301
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,853
Now, now.
What's wrong, my dear?

302
00:39:07,688 --> 00:39:10,356
I'm coming.
That's a good baby.

303
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:13,359
Are you still here?
Get out, right now.

304
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,403
I want to work here!

305
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:19,115
Keep your voice down.

306
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:22,910
I'll be right there, just be patient.

307
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:26,414
That's a good baby.
There, there.

308
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:28,791
Please give me a job!

309
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:31,711
All right, just pipe down.

310
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:36,591
There, there, good baby.

311
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,446
That's your contract.

312
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:01,449
Sign on the bottom line.

313
00:40:02,076 --> 00:40:03,576
I'll put you to work.

314
00:40:04,244 --> 00:40:07,163
But one peep out of you
about anything...

315
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:09,749
and I'll turn you into a piglet.

316
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,502
Should I sign here?

317
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:16,130
Where else?
Quit dilly-dallying.

318
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:22,929
Unbelievable.

319
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,265
What a ridiculous oath I took.

320
00:40:27,684 --> 00:40:31,270
I'm bound to give work
to whoever asks.

321
00:40:33,607 --> 00:40:35,400
- Finished?
- Yes.

322
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,490
- Chihiro, that's your name?
- Yes.

323
00:40:42,783 --> 00:40:45,451
Quite a fancy name.

324
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,672
From now on, your name is Sen.

325
00:40:58,132 --> 00:40:59,966
Understand? Sen.

326
00:41:00,092 --> 00:41:02,677
Answer me, Sen!

327
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,262
I understand.

328
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,638
Yes ma'am?

329
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:13,062
- See to her, she's starting work today.
- Very well.

330
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:14,939
What is your name?

331
00:41:15,983 --> 00:41:18,693
Chi... I mean, Sen.

332
00:41:18,986 --> 00:41:21,154
Then follow me, Sen.

333
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:30,997
Haku, I...

334
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:32,999
No idle chatter.

335
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:35,460
Call me Master Haku.

336
00:41:51,143 --> 00:41:54,353
I'm afraid even Yubaba
can't give an order like that.

337
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,147
Humans aren't allowed here.

338
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:58,191
She signed the contract.

339
00:41:58,317 --> 00:42:00,526
- What!
- I'll work hard.

340
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:04,280
- Don't send her to us.
- She stinks to high heaven.

341
00:42:05,032 --> 00:42:07,867
She won't stink
after three days of our food.

342
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:12,205
If she doesn't measure up,
do with her as you will.

343
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:16,292
Now go back to work.
Where's Lin?

344
00:42:16,418 --> 00:42:18,794
What, you're dumping her on me?

345
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:20,546
You wanted an assistant.

346
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:23,633
That's right! Lin's just perfect.

347
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:25,134
Go, Sen.

348
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,260
Yes sir.

349
00:42:27,054 --> 00:42:30,389
What a pain.
You're gonna pay for this.

350
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:32,517
Off you go.

351
00:42:34,895 --> 00:42:36,187
Come on.

352
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,531
You pulled it off!

353
00:42:47,157 --> 00:42:49,283
You're so thick, I was worried.

354
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:53,371
Keep your wits about you.
If you need anything, ask me.

355
00:42:55,249 --> 00:42:56,791
What's wrong?

356
00:42:57,751 --> 00:42:59,794
My legs are shaking.

357
00:43:04,258 --> 00:43:06,384
This is where we live.

358
00:43:07,386 --> 00:43:09,762
Eat, sleep and you'll be fine.

359
00:43:12,766 --> 00:43:14,642
Your apron.
Keep it clean.

360
00:43:14,935 --> 00:43:16,018
Trousers.

361
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:18,896
You're so puny.

362
00:43:19,565 --> 00:43:21,065
Too big.

363
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,694
Lin, are there...

364
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,778
What?

365
00:43:25,946 --> 00:43:28,030
Are there two Hakus here?

366
00:43:28,198 --> 00:43:31,701
Two of that one?
I sure hope not.

367
00:43:32,286 --> 00:43:33,286
Still too big.

368
00:43:33,412 --> 00:43:36,163
He's Yubaba's apprentice.
Be careful around him.

369
00:43:39,585 --> 00:43:41,752
Now where was that...

370
00:43:42,462 --> 00:43:44,630
All right, here we go.

371
00:43:45,966 --> 00:43:50,094
Hey, are you okay?
Don't fall apart on me.

372
00:43:50,971 --> 00:43:53,306
What's all the noise, Lin?

373
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:55,850
New girl.
Says she feels faint.

374
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:32,113
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll take you to your mother and father.

375
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,491
My shoes are gone.

376
00:46:31,798 --> 00:46:33,424
Thank you.

377
00:47:41,868 --> 00:47:43,327
Follow me.

378
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:28,956
Dad, Mom, it's me!

379
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:30,791
It's Sen.

380
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:33,878
Mom! Dad!

381
00:48:37,007 --> 00:48:38,924
Are they sick? Are they hurt?

382
00:48:39,092 --> 00:48:41,802
They're just sleeping.
Their stomachs are full.

383
00:48:42,554 --> 00:48:45,472
They don't remember
they were ever human.

384
00:48:51,104 --> 00:48:53,522
Listen to me!
I promise I'll save you.

385
00:48:53,648 --> 00:48:56,817
Don't get too fat
or they'll eat you.

386
00:49:05,118 --> 00:49:06,702
Hide these.

387
00:49:09,623 --> 00:49:10,956
I thought they were gone.

388
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,292
For when you go home.

389
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:21,759
This was a farewell card.

390
00:49:23,178 --> 00:49:24,678
Chihiro?

391
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:28,182
Chihiro...
That's my name!

392
00:49:29,225 --> 00:49:31,685
Yubaba controls us
by stealing our names.

393
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:36,523
You're Sen here.
Keep your real name a secret.

394
00:49:36,816 --> 00:49:39,944
She almost got my name.
I was turning into Sen.

395
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,031
Without your real name,
you'll never find your way home.

396
00:49:44,991 --> 00:49:47,451
I no longer remember mine.

397
00:49:47,661 --> 00:49:49,453
Your real name?

398
00:49:49,663 --> 00:49:52,998
But it's strange,
I remember yours.

399
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,045
Better eat, you must be hungry.

400
00:49:58,338 --> 00:49:59,713
I don't want to.

401
00:50:00,006 --> 00:50:04,093
I put a spell on them
to give you back your strength.

402
00:50:40,547 --> 00:50:43,173
You've had a rough time.
Better eat more.

403
00:50:58,064 --> 00:50:59,356
You know the way back.

404
00:50:59,482 --> 00:51:02,151
Thanks Haku.
I promise to work hard.

405
00:52:37,122 --> 00:52:39,581
Where were you? I was worried.

406
00:52:39,707 --> 00:52:40,916
Sorry.

407
00:52:50,218 --> 00:52:52,052
Out of the way.

408
00:53:04,899 --> 00:53:07,151
Come on,
give it some elbow grease.

409
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:10,237
Starting today, you two
are on the big tub.

410
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,531
What? That's Frog work!

411
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:15,742
Orders from the top.
And no shirking, either.

412
00:53:35,847 --> 00:53:37,764
Aren't you getting wet?

413
00:53:41,895 --> 00:53:43,478
Sen, come on!

414
00:53:43,605 --> 00:53:44,897
Coming!

415
00:53:45,064 --> 00:53:46,773
I'll leave this open.

416
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,678
- On the big tub, Lin?
- Stuff it.

417
00:54:20,308 --> 00:54:23,477
Just look at this.
Hasn't been scrubbed in ages.

418
00:54:37,992 --> 00:54:41,161
The big tub is reserved
for our filthiest guests.

419
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:42,996
It's caked with sludge.

420
00:54:43,289 --> 00:54:45,749
Lin! Sen!
First customers are coming.

421
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:47,542
All right already!

422
00:54:47,669 --> 00:54:49,878
Man, this is pure harassment.

423
00:54:50,004 --> 00:54:53,131
Go get a tag
from the foreman.

424
00:54:53,258 --> 00:54:54,341
A tag?

425
00:54:57,136 --> 00:54:59,012
For an herbal bath.

426
00:54:59,264 --> 00:55:00,514
Right.

427
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:03,267
Lin, what's a foreman?

428
00:55:07,522 --> 00:55:10,315
Something's coming.
I wonder...

429
00:55:19,325 --> 00:55:23,161
Is some good-for-nothing
using the rain to sneak in?

430
00:55:47,437 --> 00:55:49,938
Absolutely not,
it's too valuable to waste.

431
00:55:50,189 --> 00:55:51,857
Good morning!

432
00:55:52,317 --> 00:55:54,276
Feeling refreshed?

433
00:55:54,694 --> 00:55:55,861
For Kasuga.

434
00:55:55,987 --> 00:55:58,155
One deluxe sulfur bath.

435
00:55:58,531 --> 00:56:00,991
No point standing there.
Back to work.

436
00:56:01,367 --> 00:56:02,868
Scrub it with your hands.

437
00:56:03,036 --> 00:56:04,745
Good morning!

438
00:56:05,038 --> 00:56:05,996
Your bare hands.

439
00:56:06,122 --> 00:56:09,374
But she said
it has to be an herbal bath.

440
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,126
You just don't get it.

441
00:56:11,252 --> 00:56:13,211
Mugwort, right?

442
00:56:13,546 --> 00:56:15,505
Relax and enjoy.

443
00:56:24,557 --> 00:56:27,225
Foreman.
Yes ma'am!

444
00:56:29,312 --> 00:56:30,354
Thank you!

445
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,605
But that's not...

446
00:56:31,814 --> 00:56:33,231
Hey you, wait!

447
00:56:33,399 --> 00:56:34,232
What's the trouble?

448
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,817
Oh, nothing at all.

449
00:56:36,194 --> 00:56:37,736
We have an intruder.

450
00:56:37,904 --> 00:56:38,695
A human?

451
00:56:38,821 --> 00:56:41,823
You figure it out.
Haku's gone today.

452
00:56:42,033 --> 00:56:44,409
Wow, you got a really good one.

453
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:47,079
This goes straight to Kamaji.

454
00:56:48,664 --> 00:56:50,499
Water should be right up.

455
00:56:56,547 --> 00:56:59,466
Yank this for hot water.
Go ahead, try it.

456
00:57:08,142 --> 00:57:10,477
You're really are a klutz.

457
00:57:10,645 --> 00:57:12,729
Look at that color.

458
00:57:12,855 --> 00:57:15,148
This one has dried worm salts.

459
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:18,652
With water this murky,
who's gonna see the sludge?

460
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:23,615
Yank it again
when it's full. It'll stop.

461
00:57:24,075 --> 00:57:27,411
You can let go now.
I'll go get our breakfast.

462
00:57:27,537 --> 00:57:28,787
Okay.

463
00:57:51,102 --> 00:57:53,228
Ouch!

464
00:57:57,275 --> 00:57:59,943
Um...
The bath's not ready yet.

465
00:58:05,491 --> 00:58:06,950
So many...

466
00:58:09,662 --> 00:58:11,580
They're for me?

467
00:58:14,709 --> 00:58:17,210
But I don't need them.

468
00:58:19,964 --> 00:58:21,715
No, you gave me one already.

469
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:37,606
Madam!

470
00:58:37,732 --> 00:58:41,276
- It's a Stink Spirit.
- Yes, and a large one, too.

471
00:58:41,402 --> 00:58:43,153
It's headed straight for the bridge!

472
00:58:43,279 --> 00:58:45,655
Please turn back.

473
00:58:46,365 --> 00:58:49,659
Please go!
The baths are closed for the night.

474
00:58:49,911 --> 00:58:52,370
Please withdraw, please!

475
00:58:52,538 --> 00:58:55,165
Stinky!

476
00:58:55,374 --> 00:58:59,252
That's odd.
Stink Spirits feel different.

477
00:58:59,378 --> 00:59:01,922
Well, now that it's here,
better go greet it!

478
00:59:02,632 --> 00:59:06,176
All we can do
is get rid of it fast.

479
00:59:06,761 --> 00:59:08,553
Everyone, please return to your rooms!

480
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:10,430
Please hurry.
Terribly sorry!

481
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:14,518
Lin and Sen, Yubaba wants you.

482
00:59:14,644 --> 00:59:15,435
Yes sir!

483
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:18,271
Pay attention, this is your debut.

484
00:59:18,397 --> 00:59:21,191
Show the customer to the big tub.

485
00:59:22,193 --> 00:59:24,194
Remember, one peep
out of you and you're coal.

486
00:59:24,445 --> 00:59:27,364
- Got it?
- It has arrived.

487
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:39,751
No, that's not polite!

488
00:59:47,802 --> 00:59:51,263
Welgum to our bazz.

489
00:59:54,642 --> 00:59:56,601
Oh...
Money...!

490
00:59:56,769 --> 00:59:59,312
Hurry Sen, take it!

491
00:59:59,438 --> 01:00:00,689
Yez ma'am.

492
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:13,577
Wud are you wading for?
Show him to da bazz!

493
01:00:13,703 --> 01:00:15,453
Diz way...

494
01:00:33,973 --> 01:00:35,640
Sen!

495
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:42,439
Horrible!

496
01:00:43,524 --> 01:00:44,482
Breakfast!

497
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:46,693
Open the windows, all of 'em!

498
01:01:29,904 --> 01:01:32,572
What? Just a minute.

499
01:01:38,204 --> 01:01:40,955
- That's really filthy.
- It's not funny.

500
01:01:41,082 --> 01:01:42,666
What will she do?

501
01:01:47,254 --> 01:01:49,631
Ah, she's going to refill the tub.

502
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:53,718
Oh dear, she's soiling the walls
with her dirty hands!

503
01:02:05,898 --> 01:02:07,732
Did you give Sen new tags?

504
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,527
Never, what a waste!

505
01:02:51,819 --> 01:02:54,446
All that precious herbal essence!

506
01:03:20,514 --> 01:03:22,766
Sen! Sen, where are you?

507
01:03:22,892 --> 01:03:25,143
- Lin!
- Are you okay?

508
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:27,937
I asked Kamaji to help us out.

509
01:03:28,481 --> 01:03:30,565
He's sending his
best herbal essence.

510
01:03:30,983 --> 01:03:34,194
Thanks. There's a thorn
or something stuck in him.

511
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,320
A thorn?

512
01:03:35,446 --> 01:03:37,071
I can't pull it out.

513
01:03:37,323 --> 01:03:39,908
A thorn? Hmm...

514
01:03:41,368 --> 01:03:43,036
Get everyone downstairs!

515
01:03:43,162 --> 01:03:43,953
Hurry!

516
01:03:47,541 --> 01:03:49,000
Sen and Lin!

517
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:51,586
Our guest is no Stink Spirit.

518
01:03:53,714 --> 01:03:55,256
Use this rope.

519
01:03:55,382 --> 01:03:56,466
Yes ma'am!

520
01:04:05,226 --> 01:04:06,726
Tie it good and tight!

521
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:11,940
Hurry up!
Girls, lend a hand!

522
01:04:12,274 --> 01:04:13,942
It's tied!

523
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:18,530
Everyone ready? All together now!

524
01:04:18,656 --> 01:04:21,449
Heave!

525
01:04:22,076 --> 01:04:23,952
And heave!

526
01:04:24,203 --> 01:04:28,706
Heave!

527
01:04:36,549 --> 01:04:37,465
A bicycle?

528
01:04:38,092 --> 01:04:41,469
I knew it.
Now, heave!

529
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,222
Heave!

530
01:05:15,796 --> 01:05:18,423
Sen, are you all right?

531
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:31,394
Well done.

532
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,967
Gold! It's gold!

533
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,720
Hands off! That's company property.

534
01:06:05,846 --> 01:06:09,307
Quiet! Our guest is still with us.

535
01:06:15,189 --> 01:06:18,149
Sen, you're in the way.
Get down from there.

536
01:06:18,317 --> 01:06:20,818
Open the main gates!
He's leaving!

537
01:06:47,554 --> 01:06:51,683
Sen, you're a wonder!
You made us a fortune.

538
01:06:52,393 --> 01:06:54,978
That was the guardian
of a great river.

539
01:06:55,104 --> 01:06:56,771
Everyone, learn from Sen!

540
01:06:57,356 --> 01:06:59,357
Sake on the house tonight.

541
01:06:59,858 --> 01:07:02,527
Now hand over all
that gold you picked up.

542
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:18,167
Want some? I swiped them.

543
01:07:18,669 --> 01:07:20,044
Thanks.

544
01:07:20,212 --> 01:07:22,380
What a day.

545
01:07:24,883 --> 01:07:26,300
Haku missed the whole thing.

546
01:07:26,427 --> 01:07:28,302
Not Haku again!

547
01:07:29,221 --> 01:07:31,597
Sometimes he just disappears.

548
01:07:32,057 --> 01:07:35,810
They say Yubaba makes
him do bad stuff.

549
01:07:35,936 --> 01:07:36,728
Really?

550
01:07:36,895 --> 01:07:38,271
Lights out, Lin.

551
01:07:38,397 --> 01:07:39,439
Okay.

552
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:07,300
There's a town.
And the water's like an ocean.

553
01:08:07,468 --> 01:08:10,470
What did you expect
after all that rain?

554
01:08:12,306 --> 01:08:16,309
I'm gonna get there someday.
I'll get out of here for sure.

555
01:08:40,793 --> 01:08:42,126
What's wrong?

556
01:09:11,698 --> 01:09:13,199
Gold!

557
01:09:16,036 --> 01:09:19,038
Who are you? You're no customer.

558
01:09:19,164 --> 01:09:20,915
You're not allowed in there.

559
01:09:27,339 --> 01:09:30,716
Hey, it's gold! For me?

560
01:09:36,014 --> 01:09:38,349
You can make gold?

561
01:09:43,897 --> 01:09:44,856
Gimme!

562
01:09:53,073 --> 01:09:54,782
Who's down here?

563
01:09:55,826 --> 01:09:58,202
It's way past lights out.

564
01:10:01,748 --> 01:10:05,042
Hey boss, I'm hungry.

565
01:10:05,169 --> 01:10:06,210
Starved, in fact.

566
01:10:06,378 --> 01:10:07,253
That voice...

567
01:10:07,379 --> 01:10:09,297
There, I'll pay you now.

568
01:10:10,048 --> 01:10:12,675
I'm a customer.
I want a bath.

569
01:10:12,801 --> 01:10:14,427
Wake everyone up!

570
01:10:19,933 --> 01:10:23,227
Mom and Dad, the river guardian
gave me this medicine.

571
01:10:23,395 --> 01:10:26,272
If you take it,
you'll be people again.

572
01:10:30,402 --> 01:10:32,403
Dad, Mom, where are you?

573
01:10:32,779 --> 01:10:34,030
Daddy!

574
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:46,292
What an awful dream.

575
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,086
Lin?

576
01:10:53,258 --> 01:10:54,800
Where is everybody?

577
01:11:01,308 --> 01:11:04,101
Wow, it really did
turn into an ocean!

578
01:11:09,358 --> 01:11:12,360
I can see where Mom and
Dad are from here.

579
01:11:16,073 --> 01:11:18,032
Kamaji lit the fires already.

580
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:20,076
Did I sleep that long?

581
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:26,749
The customer's waiting.
Can't you work faster?

582
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:30,878
Serve everything you've got,
even leftovers!

583
01:11:32,839 --> 01:11:33,756
Sen!

584
01:11:33,882 --> 01:11:34,882
Lin?

585
01:11:35,092 --> 01:11:37,843
I was just coming
to wake you up, look!

586
01:11:38,095 --> 01:11:40,346
Gold! He gave me real gold.

587
01:11:40,681 --> 01:11:42,723
We've got a real high roller.

588
01:11:42,849 --> 01:11:45,226
Please, sir, try this!

589
01:11:49,356 --> 01:11:51,983
Throw us some gold!

590
01:11:53,986 --> 01:11:57,321
I'm starving, bring it all!

591
01:12:01,994 --> 01:12:03,244
Who's this guest?

592
01:12:03,537 --> 01:12:06,914
Come on, Yubaba's still asleep.
Now's your chance.

593
01:12:07,374 --> 01:12:09,250
I'm going to see Kamaji.

594
01:12:09,876 --> 01:12:12,003
I wouldn't go there now.

595
01:12:12,129 --> 01:12:14,338
He's angry because they woke him up.

596
01:12:14,506 --> 01:12:16,340
Lin, let's go back for more.

597
01:12:41,533 --> 01:12:44,869
What if I can't recognize my parents?

598
01:12:45,704 --> 01:12:48,456
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

599
01:13:16,735 --> 01:13:18,235
That's the dragon I saw.

600
01:13:18,737 --> 01:13:20,237
It's coming this way.

601
01:13:22,949 --> 01:13:24,283
Those aren't birds!

602
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:38,798
Haku, don't give up.
Over here!

603
01:13:40,384 --> 01:13:41,467
Haku!

604
01:14:00,862 --> 01:14:02,029
It's just paper.

605
01:14:30,308 --> 01:14:32,476
Haku? It is you, isn't it?

606
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:41,944
Are you hurt?
Those paper birds are gone.

607
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:43,362
You're safe now.

608
01:14:56,543 --> 01:14:58,294
He's going to Yubaba.

609
01:14:58,879 --> 01:15:01,338
What should I do? He'll die!

610
01:15:09,014 --> 01:15:13,559
Now the richest man
in the whole wide world...

611
01:15:13,894 --> 01:15:17,938
has come to grace us
with his presence.

612
01:15:18,982 --> 01:15:20,900
Greetings!

613
01:15:21,026 --> 01:15:24,361
Now let us appeal
to his generosity.

614
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:26,697
Please, sir! Over here.

615
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,327
I hope I get some.

616
01:15:31,453 --> 01:15:33,454
They say gold
springs from his palms.

617
01:15:34,331 --> 01:15:37,374
Toss some this way, sir!

618
01:15:41,379 --> 01:15:42,755
What are you doing?

619
01:15:42,881 --> 01:15:43,839
Going upstairs.

620
01:15:43,965 --> 01:15:46,008
No you don't.
What's this?

621
01:15:46,718 --> 01:15:47,968
Blood!

622
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:54,141
Out of the way,
we have a guest.

623
01:15:55,727 --> 01:15:57,520
Thank you for your help.

624
01:15:57,896 --> 01:16:00,314
Get out of the way!

625
01:16:22,254 --> 01:16:23,921
I don't need it.

626
01:16:26,841 --> 01:16:29,176
I'm busy, please excuse me.

627
01:16:40,814 --> 01:16:43,691
Quiet! Quiet down.

628
01:16:44,359 --> 01:16:46,026
Back, get back!

629
01:16:46,444 --> 01:16:48,571
Please excuse her manners.

630
01:16:48,697 --> 01:16:52,241
The girl is new and a human.

631
01:16:54,786 --> 01:16:57,371
What's so funny?
Wipe off that smile.

632
01:16:57,622 --> 01:16:58,956
Why, I would never...

633
01:17:03,878 --> 01:17:06,255
He ate them!

634
01:18:33,176 --> 01:18:34,426
Yubaba!

635
01:19:47,041 --> 01:19:49,918
We're in a fine mess now.

636
01:19:50,545 --> 01:19:52,629
He's a No Face.

637
01:19:52,797 --> 01:19:54,757
That's right, a No Face!

638
01:19:55,049 --> 01:19:57,968
Your greed attracted quite a guest.

639
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:01,722
Don't do anything stupid
until I get down there.

640
01:20:02,307 --> 01:20:04,683
Just look at this carpet.

641
01:20:04,809 --> 01:20:07,060
Get Haku out of here.

642
01:20:07,187 --> 01:20:09,062
He's useless to me now.

643
01:20:31,544 --> 01:20:34,630
Bo, sleeping outside
your crib again?

644
01:20:38,551 --> 01:20:42,679
Oh I'm sorry, you were
sleeping like such a good baby.

645
01:20:42,847 --> 01:20:45,766
Baba still has work to do.

646
01:20:48,686 --> 01:20:51,480
Go back to sleep now,
that's a good baby.

647
01:21:19,509 --> 01:21:21,426
Ouch, let me go!

648
01:21:21,886 --> 01:21:23,720
Oh, thanks for helping me.

649
01:21:23,847 --> 01:21:27,140
But I'm in a hurry,
please let me go.

650
01:21:27,267 --> 01:21:29,601
You came to make me sick.

651
01:21:30,144 --> 01:21:32,729
The outside has bad germs.

652
01:21:33,606 --> 01:21:37,484
I'm a human.
Maybe you never saw one before.

653
01:21:37,735 --> 01:21:40,028
You'll get sick out there.

654
01:21:40,154 --> 01:21:42,239
Stay here and play with me.

655
01:21:42,407 --> 01:21:43,949
Are you sick?

656
01:21:44,075 --> 01:21:46,910
I'm in here 'cause
I'll get sick outside.

657
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:49,496
Staying inside will make you sick!

658
01:21:49,622 --> 01:21:53,375
You see, someone I really
care about is badly hurt.

659
01:21:53,501 --> 01:21:55,127
I've got to go right now.

660
01:21:55,253 --> 01:21:56,628
Please let me go.

661
01:21:56,838 --> 01:22:01,967
If you go, I'll start crying.
Then Baba will come and kill you.

662
01:22:02,135 --> 01:22:03,844
I'll break your little arm.

663
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:05,095
You're hurting me!

664
01:22:05,263 --> 01:22:07,764
Please, I'll come play with you later.

665
01:22:07,932 --> 01:22:09,516
No, I wanna play now!

666
01:22:13,521 --> 01:22:15,689
Blood! See? It's blood!

667
01:22:27,285 --> 01:22:28,785
Haku!

668
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,204
Go away!

669
01:22:31,331 --> 01:22:32,414
It's you, isn't it?

670
01:22:32,624 --> 01:22:33,957
Hang on!

671
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:35,375
Be quiet!

672
01:22:35,501 --> 01:22:36,627
Haku!

673
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:43,383
Go away!

674
01:22:46,054 --> 01:22:47,387
No!

675
01:23:02,487 --> 01:23:06,239
I'm not afraid of blood.
I'll cry if you don't play.

676
01:23:06,407 --> 01:23:08,241
Please be a good boy and wait.

677
01:23:08,868 --> 01:23:11,662
If you don't play
with me I'll cry...

678
01:23:13,665 --> 01:23:15,040
Please, wait!

679
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:18,460
What a racket.
Simmer down.

680
01:23:19,754 --> 01:23:22,172
You're a little butterball, aren't you?

681
01:23:30,014 --> 01:23:32,224
I am a bit transparent here.

682
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:33,183
Baba...

683
01:23:33,851 --> 01:23:37,771
Oh dear, can't you even tell
me from your own mother?

684
01:23:46,114 --> 01:23:48,865
There, that gives you
a little more freedom.

685
01:23:48,992 --> 01:23:52,285
Let's see now.
What shall we turn you into?

686
01:24:10,304 --> 01:24:13,015
This is our little secret.
If you tell anyone...

687
01:24:13,141 --> 01:24:15,183
I'll do the same to you.

688
01:24:16,728 --> 01:24:17,894
Who are you?

689
01:24:18,062 --> 01:24:20,439
Yubaba's older twin sister.

690
01:24:20,565 --> 01:24:24,359
Thanks to you I've had
a nice tour of the place.

691
01:24:24,485 --> 01:24:26,445
Now hand over the dragon.

692
01:24:26,696 --> 01:24:29,072
What are you going to do?
He needs help.

693
01:24:29,407 --> 01:24:32,534
That dragon's a thief.
He works for my sister.

694
01:24:32,702 --> 01:24:35,704
He stole a valuable seal from my house.

695
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:38,582
Haku would never do that.
He's too kind.

696
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:42,627
All dragons are kind.
Kind and stupid...

697
01:24:42,754 --> 01:24:47,340
and eager to learn
my sister's magical ways.

698
01:24:47,759 --> 01:24:51,344
This boy will do anything
that greedy woman wants.

699
01:24:51,596 --> 01:24:53,680
Now step aside.

700
01:24:53,806 --> 01:24:56,266
It's too late for him anyway.

701
01:24:56,434 --> 01:24:59,561
The thing he stole
had a protection spell.

702
01:24:59,687 --> 01:25:01,813
Now the thief will die.

703
01:25:02,607 --> 01:25:04,274
No, don't!

704
01:25:11,783 --> 01:25:13,784
What are you up to now?

705
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:16,578
All right, that's enough.
Back to your room.

706
01:25:24,253 --> 01:25:26,296
Oh dear, that was careless...

707
01:25:26,839 --> 01:25:28,173
Haku, no!

708
01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:50,779
Haku!

709
01:26:18,766 --> 01:26:20,392
What is this?

710
01:26:20,518 --> 01:26:21,977
Hold on there!

711
01:26:24,939 --> 01:26:26,231
Haku!

712
01:26:29,694 --> 01:26:31,278
Does it hurt?

713
01:26:34,907 --> 01:26:37,033
This is serious.

714
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,287
Haku, don't give up.

715
01:26:40,413 --> 01:26:42,205
What can we do? He'll die!

716
01:26:42,707 --> 01:26:45,417
Something inside him
is eating him up.

717
01:26:45,543 --> 01:26:46,626
Inside him?

718
01:26:46,752 --> 01:26:50,088
It's a strong spell.
There's nothing I can do.

719
01:26:50,381 --> 01:26:53,675
Haku, the river guardian gave me this.

720
01:26:53,801 --> 01:26:55,969
Eat it, maybe it will help.

721
01:26:58,222 --> 01:27:00,473
Haku, open your mouth.

722
01:27:00,725 --> 01:27:03,310
Please Haku, eat it.

723
01:27:05,062 --> 01:27:06,855
See, it's safe.

724
01:27:07,148 --> 01:27:09,232
Is it some kind of medicine?

725
01:27:09,483 --> 01:27:12,527
Open your mouth.
You can do it.

726
01:27:16,324 --> 01:27:18,074
That's it.

727
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:19,618
Swallow it.

728
01:27:38,012 --> 01:27:39,387
He spit something out.
That's it!

729
01:27:52,109 --> 01:27:53,318
The seal!

730
01:27:53,486 --> 01:27:55,320
It's getting away.
There! Over there!

731
01:28:15,049 --> 01:28:17,717
Sen, we have to purge the spell.

732
01:28:21,889 --> 01:28:22,806
Begone!

733
01:28:22,932 --> 01:28:25,725
Haku took this from Yubaba's sister.

734
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,728
From Zeniba? That's a witch's seal.

735
01:28:29,146 --> 01:28:31,273
Precious loot, I'd say.

736
01:28:34,777 --> 01:28:35,777
I knew it was Haku.

737
01:28:35,903 --> 01:28:37,487
Kamaji, it's Haku!

738
01:28:39,699 --> 01:28:40,657
Haku!

739
01:28:40,825 --> 01:28:42,325
Haku, Haku!

740
01:28:44,662 --> 01:28:46,621
Kamaji, he's not breathing.

741
01:28:46,747 --> 01:28:50,333
He is, but he's still
very ill from the spell.

742
01:28:59,593 --> 01:29:02,595
That should calm him some.

743
01:29:05,016 --> 01:29:09,894
Haku turned up one day,
just like you.

744
01:29:10,021 --> 01:29:12,856
He said he wanted to learn magic.

745
01:29:13,149 --> 01:29:15,150
I tried to warn him.

746
01:29:15,276 --> 01:29:18,945
Becoming a sorcerer's apprentice
is dangerous business.

747
01:29:19,447 --> 01:29:21,865
But he wouldn't listen.
He kept saying...

748
01:29:22,116 --> 01:29:23,742
that he'd lost his home.

749
01:29:23,868 --> 01:29:27,412
So he signed up to be
Yubaba's apprentice.

750
01:29:27,872 --> 01:29:30,999
He got paler and paler
as time went by...

751
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:34,044
and got a sharp
gleam in his eye.

752
01:29:36,088 --> 01:29:40,091
Kamaji, I'm going to give
this back to Zeniba.

753
01:29:40,217 --> 01:29:43,928
Give it back, apologize,
and ask her to help Haku.

754
01:29:44,055 --> 01:29:45,972
Tell me how to get there.

755
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:48,725
To Zeniba's house?

756
01:29:49,143 --> 01:29:51,061
That's one scary sorceress.

757
01:29:51,187 --> 01:29:51,978
Please.

758
01:29:52,229 --> 01:29:56,232
Haku helped me.
Now I want to help him.

759
01:29:57,943 --> 01:30:01,071
Well, getting there is one thing.

760
01:30:01,238 --> 01:30:03,156
Getting back's the problem.

761
01:30:03,491 --> 01:30:05,241
Wait a minute.

762
01:30:07,661 --> 01:30:10,997
Let's see now,
they're here somewhere...

763
01:30:11,665 --> 01:30:14,751
Everyone, I need
my shoes and clothes.

764
01:30:23,094 --> 01:30:26,096
Sen! I've been hunting
for you everywhere!

765
01:30:28,641 --> 01:30:29,766
Lin...

766
01:30:29,892 --> 01:30:32,560
Haku? What happened here?

767
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:34,270
Who are those guys?

768
01:30:35,356 --> 01:30:36,815
My new friends.

769
01:30:36,941 --> 01:30:37,649
Right?

770
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:41,069
Yubaba's looking for you.
She's hopping mad.

771
01:30:41,278 --> 01:30:44,906
That big tipper turned out
to be a No Face.

772
01:30:45,366 --> 01:30:47,784
Yubaba says you let him in.

773
01:30:51,205 --> 01:30:52,455
She might be right.

774
01:30:52,581 --> 01:30:54,624
What, are you serious?

775
01:30:54,792 --> 01:30:56,418
I thought he was a customer.

776
01:30:56,544 --> 01:30:59,712
He's already swallowed
three of our people!

777
01:31:00,131 --> 01:31:03,133
Found them.
Here they are, Sen.

778
01:31:03,551 --> 01:31:05,176
We're busy, gramps.

779
01:31:05,302 --> 01:31:06,886
You can use these.

780
01:31:08,305 --> 01:31:11,099
Train tickets?
Where'd you get those?

781
01:31:11,225 --> 01:31:13,685
Leftovers from 40 years ago.

782
01:31:13,811 --> 01:31:17,564
You get off at the sixth stop,
called Swamp Bottom.

783
01:31:17,815 --> 01:31:18,898
Swamp Bottom?

784
01:31:19,024 --> 01:31:20,942
That's right, the sixth stop.

785
01:31:21,068 --> 01:31:22,068
Six.

786
01:31:22,445 --> 01:31:26,030
Make sure you get it right.
There used to be a return train...

787
01:31:26,157 --> 01:31:27,991
but these days it's one way only.

788
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:29,826
Still want to go?

789
01:31:29,952 --> 01:31:33,163
Yes, I'll walk back along the tracks.

790
01:31:34,874 --> 01:31:36,624
What about Yubaba?

791
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:38,001
I'll talk to her now.

792
01:31:38,836 --> 01:31:42,630
Haku, I promise I'll be back.
Please don't die.

793
01:31:43,257 --> 01:31:44,924
What's going on here?

794
01:31:45,509 --> 01:31:47,969
Don't you understand? It's love.

795
01:31:55,853 --> 01:31:58,188
It just keeps getting bigger!

796
01:31:58,355 --> 01:32:00,982
- Don't let it eat me!
- Here she comes.

797
01:32:08,532 --> 01:32:09,991
Thank goodness, Sen!

798
01:32:10,117 --> 01:32:12,327
Yubaba can't control him.

799
01:32:15,539 --> 01:32:19,375
There's no need to get upset.
Sen will be here soon.

800
01:32:19,793 --> 01:32:22,295
Where's Sen? I want Sen!

801
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:24,255
Now hurry!

802
01:32:29,595 --> 01:32:31,513
Yubaba, it's Sen.

803
01:32:31,639 --> 01:32:33,014
Where were you?

804
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:37,560
Sen is here, honored guest.
She'll be right with you.

805
01:32:38,604 --> 01:32:41,731
What took you so long?
This is a total disaster!

806
01:32:41,899 --> 01:32:44,734
Win him over
and take all his gold.

807
01:32:48,614 --> 01:32:50,949
What's this filthy rat?

808
01:32:52,785 --> 01:32:55,161
Don't you recognize him?

809
01:32:55,412 --> 01:32:58,164
Of course not.
How disgusting.

810
01:32:58,374 --> 01:32:59,749
Now in you go.

811
01:33:01,252 --> 01:33:03,503
Have a nice time.

812
01:33:04,421 --> 01:33:06,673
Will she be all right?

813
01:33:06,924 --> 01:33:08,758
Want to take her place?

814
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,448
Try this, it's yummy.

815
01:33:34,326 --> 01:33:38,830
Want some gold?
I've decided it's just for you.

816
01:33:42,835 --> 01:33:44,586
Come over here.

817
01:33:44,712 --> 01:33:48,339
What do you want?
You can tell me.

818
01:33:48,674 --> 01:33:50,592
Where did you come from?

819
01:33:50,718 --> 01:33:53,094
There's someplace
I have to go right away.

820
01:33:55,472 --> 01:33:57,932
You should go home.

821
01:33:58,142 --> 01:34:01,102
You can't give me what I want.

822
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:05,982
Where's your home?
You must have a mom and dad.

823
01:34:06,817 --> 01:34:10,111
No... No...

824
01:34:11,071 --> 01:34:14,824
I'm lonely... So lonely...

825
01:34:15,659 --> 01:34:17,160
Are you lost?

826
01:34:17,536 --> 01:34:21,080
Sen... I want Sen.

827
01:34:21,707 --> 01:34:22,832
Take the gold.

828
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:24,500
Would you eat me?

829
01:34:24,668 --> 01:34:25,460
Take it.

830
01:34:25,586 --> 01:34:26,461
Take it!

831
01:34:35,721 --> 01:34:38,431
Before you eat me, eat this first.

832
01:34:39,224 --> 01:34:43,061
I was saving it for my parents,
but you can have it.

833
01:35:03,874 --> 01:35:05,291
Sen!

834
01:35:07,753 --> 01:35:11,506
You little wench!
What did you feed me?

835
01:35:26,772 --> 01:35:28,106
Watch out!

836
01:35:29,274 --> 01:35:31,109
Not in my house!

837
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:45,957
I'm over here!

838
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,084
Here!

839
01:36:32,838 --> 01:36:34,505
You'll pay for this!

840
01:36:51,982 --> 01:36:54,025
Sen, down here!

841
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:12,627
Over here!

842
01:37:12,753 --> 01:37:14,420
We don't need him.

843
01:37:18,425 --> 01:37:21,928
He needs to get out of there.
It's bad for him.

844
01:37:22,054 --> 01:37:24,180
But where do we take him?

845
01:37:24,348 --> 01:37:25,306
I don't know.

846
01:37:25,432 --> 01:37:26,849
Don't know?

847
01:37:27,309 --> 01:37:29,936
Great, now he's following us.

848
01:37:47,454 --> 01:37:49,539
- From here you walk.
- Okay.

849
01:37:49,665 --> 01:37:51,374
You'll find the station.

850
01:37:51,542 --> 01:37:52,959
Thanks.

851
01:37:53,585 --> 01:37:55,211
Be sure to come back!

852
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:56,420
I will.

853
01:38:00,592 --> 01:38:04,053
Sen! I said you were a klutz.

854
01:38:04,221 --> 01:38:05,721
I take it back!

855
01:38:13,939 --> 01:38:18,109
No Face, hurt her
and you'll get it from me!

856
01:38:21,405 --> 01:38:22,738
There it is.

857
01:38:34,293 --> 01:38:36,669
The train's coming, let's hurry.

858
01:39:00,152 --> 01:39:02,403
To Swamp Bottom, please.

859
01:39:08,994 --> 01:39:10,661
You want to come too?

860
01:39:12,164 --> 01:39:14,165
One more, please.

861
01:39:54,706 --> 01:39:56,040
Sit down.

862
01:39:56,667 --> 01:39:58,334
Behave yourself, okay?

863
01:42:00,499 --> 01:42:01,957
Kamaji.

864
01:42:04,336 --> 01:42:06,921
Oh, Haku.
You're awake.

865
01:42:07,047 --> 01:42:08,589
Kamaji, where's Sen?

866
01:42:09,007 --> 01:42:11,592
What happened? Please tell me.

867
01:42:11,843 --> 01:42:14,720
Don't you remember anything?

868
01:42:15,305 --> 01:42:17,389
Just fragments.

869
01:42:17,599 --> 01:42:20,684
Chihiro kept calling my name
in the darkness.

870
01:42:20,977 --> 01:42:24,980
I followed her voice
and woke up here.

871
01:42:25,357 --> 01:42:30,236
Chihiro?
So her name is Chihiro.

872
01:42:31,488 --> 01:42:34,365
Wonderful... It's the power of love.

873
01:42:38,036 --> 01:42:41,122
This gold will hardly cover the damage.

874
01:42:41,248 --> 01:42:44,166
That fool, Sen!
She just cost me a fortune.

875
01:42:44,668 --> 01:42:48,337
But we were saved, thanks to her.

876
01:42:48,505 --> 01:42:49,630
Silence!

877
01:42:49,756 --> 01:42:52,174
She started the whole thing.

878
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:54,593
Now she's run away.

879
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:57,388
Abandoned her own parents!

880
01:42:58,056 --> 01:43:01,892
They must be fat enough.
Turn them into bacon or ham.

881
01:43:02,227 --> 01:43:03,853
No, wait.

882
01:43:05,021 --> 01:43:06,147
Master Haku!

883
01:43:06,273 --> 01:43:08,524
What, you're still alive?

884
01:43:10,902 --> 01:43:14,280
You still don't see it?
She's played a trick on you.

885
01:43:14,739 --> 01:43:17,533
You've gotten pretty fresh.

886
01:43:17,701 --> 01:43:20,161
Since when do you talk that way?

887
01:44:11,796 --> 01:44:13,756
Bo?

888
01:44:19,763 --> 01:44:21,388
Bo!

889
01:44:21,514 --> 01:44:22,514
Pebbles!

890
01:44:22,641 --> 01:44:25,434
Bo!

891
01:44:25,936 --> 01:44:29,772
Where are you, Bo?

892
01:44:30,106 --> 01:44:32,733
Please come out.

893
01:44:33,443 --> 01:44:34,735
Bo!

894
01:44:37,989 --> 01:44:40,282
Bo?

895
01:44:45,121 --> 01:44:49,458
Why, you little...

896
01:44:50,919 --> 01:44:54,046
Out with it!

897
01:44:55,507 --> 01:44:59,635
Where did you hide my Bo?

898
01:45:00,136 --> 01:45:01,929
He's with Zeniba.

899
01:45:02,055 --> 01:45:04,014
Zeniba?

900
01:45:25,036 --> 01:45:28,706
Now I understand.
That evil witch.

901
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:31,542
She thinks she's beaten me.

902
01:45:33,211 --> 01:45:35,462
So, what's your plan?

903
01:45:35,964 --> 01:45:38,007
I'll bring him back.

904
01:45:38,174 --> 01:45:42,386
But you must send Sen and
her parents back to their world.

905
01:45:42,554 --> 01:45:44,972
And what about you?

906
01:45:45,223 --> 01:45:48,976
Maybe I'll send them back
and then tear you to pieces.

907
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:37,566
I think this is right.

908
01:46:38,735 --> 01:46:40,027
Come on.

909
01:47:06,846 --> 01:47:08,514
You can ride on my shoulder.

910
01:48:27,177 --> 01:48:28,594
Come in.

911
01:48:33,766 --> 01:48:35,559
Thank you.

912
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,938
Well, hurry up then.

913
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:41,732
Come on.

914
01:48:45,028 --> 01:48:46,862
So you all made it.

915
01:48:46,988 --> 01:48:49,406
- I...
- Have a seat.

916
01:48:49,532 --> 01:48:51,783
I'll make some tea.

917
01:48:57,624 --> 01:49:01,877
Zeniba, Haku stole this.
I came to give it back.

918
01:49:05,131 --> 01:49:07,591
Do you know what this is?

919
01:49:07,884 --> 01:49:10,802
No, but I know it's very precious.

920
01:49:10,929 --> 01:49:14,556
I'm here to apologize for him.
He's sorry.

921
01:49:15,433 --> 01:49:18,477
You held this
and nothing happened to you?

922
01:49:18,603 --> 01:49:19,520
What?

923
01:49:19,646 --> 01:49:22,439
Wait, the protection spell is gone.

924
01:49:23,566 --> 01:49:26,735
I'm sorry.
There was this strange bug.

925
01:49:26,861 --> 01:49:28,695
I squashed it.

926
01:49:29,239 --> 01:49:31,365
Squashed it!

927
01:49:33,409 --> 01:49:36,745
My sister snuck
that bug into the dragon...

928
01:49:36,871 --> 01:49:39,540
so she could control him.

929
01:49:39,666 --> 01:49:42,292
And you squashed it!

930
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:46,630
Now then, sit down.

931
01:49:46,798 --> 01:49:49,800
You must be No Face.
You sit, too.

932
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:54,429
Please turn them back into themselves.

933
01:49:54,556 --> 01:49:57,599
Why my dear, the spell's long broken.

934
01:49:57,767 --> 01:50:00,143
They can change back any time.

935
01:50:07,443 --> 01:50:11,280
Yubaba and I are two halves of
a whole, but we don't get along.

936
01:50:11,406 --> 01:50:13,949
You know what bad taste she has.

937
01:50:14,117 --> 01:50:17,160
Sorceress twins are
just a recipe for trouble.

938
01:50:21,207 --> 01:50:25,669
I'd like to help you dear,
but there's nothing I can do.

939
01:50:25,795 --> 01:50:27,838
It's one of our rules here.

940
01:50:28,298 --> 01:50:31,300
You'll have to save your parents
and your dragon boyfriend...

941
01:50:31,426 --> 01:50:33,051
all by yourself.

942
01:50:33,177 --> 01:50:36,096
But can't you
even give me a hint?

943
01:50:36,472 --> 01:50:39,933
I feel like Haku and I met
a long time ago.

944
01:50:40,101 --> 01:50:42,102
In that case it's easy.

945
01:50:42,395 --> 01:50:44,938
Everything that happens
stays inside you...

946
01:50:45,064 --> 01:50:47,316
even if you can't remember it.

947
01:50:48,651 --> 01:50:51,987
It's already late.
Why don't you stay the night?

948
01:50:52,405 --> 01:50:55,198
You boys give me a hand.

949
01:51:01,331 --> 01:51:03,332
Come on, keep at it.

950
01:51:06,336 --> 01:51:08,837
See? You have a talent for this.

951
01:51:09,005 --> 01:51:10,631
You're a big help.

952
01:51:11,424 --> 01:51:14,676
It's not the same
when you use magic.

953
01:51:16,012 --> 01:51:20,349
Pull it through there.
Now do it again.

954
01:51:20,558 --> 01:51:23,185
Zeniba, I'm going back after all.

955
01:51:23,853 --> 01:51:27,314
Haku could die while I'm sitting here.

956
01:51:27,523 --> 01:51:31,026
And they might eat
my mom and dad!

957
01:51:33,196 --> 01:51:35,947
Wait just a little longer.

958
01:51:36,074 --> 01:51:37,616
There we are.

959
01:51:38,451 --> 01:51:40,410
Use it to tie back your hair.

960
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:46,500
It's pretty.

961
01:51:46,709 --> 01:51:51,630
It'll protect you.
I made it from the thread we spun.

962
01:51:51,881 --> 01:51:53,173
Thank you.

963
01:52:02,725 --> 01:52:06,520
What good timing.
We've got another guest, let him in.

964
01:52:06,646 --> 01:52:07,771
Sure.

965
01:52:21,077 --> 01:52:22,202
Haku!

966
01:52:23,413 --> 01:52:24,579
Haku...

967
01:52:25,415 --> 01:52:26,998
I'm so glad to see you.

968
01:52:27,333 --> 01:52:29,793
Are you okay?
Do you feel all right?

969
01:52:30,086 --> 01:52:31,086
Thank goodness.

970
01:52:32,922 --> 01:52:35,173
Good timing, I'd say.

971
01:52:35,842 --> 01:52:38,301
Zeniba, Haku's alive.

972
01:52:38,845 --> 01:52:42,973
Haku, I no longer blame
you for what you did.

973
01:52:43,099 --> 01:52:46,476
But be sure to protect this girl.

974
01:52:46,769 --> 01:52:49,771
Okay boys, time you went home.

975
01:52:49,897 --> 01:52:51,940
Come see me again soon.

976
01:52:52,692 --> 01:52:57,028
You stay with me
and be my helper.

977
01:52:59,532 --> 01:53:00,490
Zeniba!

978
01:53:01,117 --> 01:53:03,285
Thank you, I'm going now.

979
01:53:03,411 --> 01:53:06,455
Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

980
01:53:06,622 --> 01:53:09,833
My real name is Chihiro.

981
01:53:09,959 --> 01:53:12,461
Chihiro? What a nice name.

982
01:53:12,587 --> 01:53:14,463
Take good care of it.

983
01:53:14,589 --> 01:53:15,255
I will!

984
01:53:15,381 --> 01:53:17,174
Now off you go.

985
01:53:18,885 --> 01:53:21,970
Thank you, Zeniba.
Goodbye!

986
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:12,521
Haku, listen.

987
01:54:12,855 --> 01:54:16,483
I don't remember this,
but my mom told me about it.

988
01:54:16,859 --> 01:54:20,487
Once when I was little,
I fell in a river.

989
01:54:20,947 --> 01:54:24,574
Now it's all built over.
It flows underground.

990
01:54:24,951 --> 01:54:27,077
But I just remembered.

991
01:54:28,204 --> 01:54:29,871
The river was called...

992
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:33,416
it was called the Kohaku River.

993
01:54:34,043 --> 01:54:37,045
Your real name is Kohaku.

994
01:54:58,651 --> 01:55:00,110
Chihiro, thank you!

995
01:55:00,236 --> 01:55:03,488
My name is
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

996
01:55:03,906 --> 01:55:07,117
- Nigihayami?
- Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

997
01:55:07,285 --> 01:55:09,995
What a name!
Sounds like a guardian spirit.

998
01:55:10,329 --> 01:55:14,749
I remember how
you fell into me as a child.

999
01:55:14,876 --> 01:55:16,585
You were chasing your shoe.

1000
01:55:16,794 --> 01:55:21,131
Yes, and you carried me
to shallow water.

1001
01:55:22,008 --> 01:55:23,258
I'm so happy...

1002
01:55:56,042 --> 01:55:57,459
They're back!

1003
01:56:10,806 --> 01:56:13,433
You brought Bo back with you?

1004
01:56:16,312 --> 01:56:17,228
Baba!

1005
01:56:17,355 --> 01:56:21,775
Bo! You're not hurt?
What a terrible time you had.

1006
01:56:23,027 --> 01:56:26,154
Bo, when did you learn
to stand on your own?

1007
01:56:26,739 --> 01:56:28,657
Yubaba, remember your promise.

1008
01:56:28,908 --> 01:56:31,910
Send Chihiro and her parents
back to their world.

1009
01:56:32,328 --> 01:56:34,746
Sorry, but it's not that simple.

1010
01:56:34,872 --> 01:56:37,999
This world has rules, you know.

1011
01:56:38,626 --> 01:56:39,793
Silence!

1012
01:56:39,919 --> 01:56:42,545
Just do it, Baba.
Don't be so mean.

1013
01:56:42,838 --> 01:56:45,423
Baby had such a good time.

1014
01:56:45,925 --> 01:56:48,677
But I'm just following the rule.

1015
01:56:48,803 --> 01:56:51,179
Otherwise I can't break the spell.

1016
01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:54,557
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore.

1017
01:56:54,850 --> 01:56:56,184
But...

1018
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:57,477
Granny!

1019
01:56:57,687 --> 01:56:59,062
Granny?

1020
01:56:59,397 --> 01:57:01,022
I'll do as you ask.

1021
01:57:12,868 --> 01:57:14,995
Haku told me about the rule.

1022
01:57:15,121 --> 01:57:16,913
Well, you've got guts.

1023
01:57:17,123 --> 01:57:20,375
I brought your contract.
Follow me.

1024
01:57:20,543 --> 01:57:22,585
This won't take a minute, Bo.

1025
01:57:23,587 --> 01:57:25,088
Don't worry.

1026
01:57:29,552 --> 01:57:33,388
See if you can pick out
your parents for me.

1027
01:57:42,732 --> 01:57:44,149
You get one guess.

1028
01:57:44,275 --> 01:57:46,943
Pick them out
and you all go free.

1029
01:57:58,789 --> 01:58:02,459
Granny, I can't do it.
Dad and Mom aren't here.

1030
01:58:02,626 --> 01:58:06,212
Not here?
Is that your answer?

1031
01:58:07,757 --> 01:58:08,798
Yes.

1032
01:58:11,594 --> 01:58:14,888
You're right!

1033
01:58:15,056 --> 01:58:17,515
Attagirl! Good for you.

1034
01:58:21,479 --> 01:58:22,645
Thank you everyone.

1035
01:58:22,772 --> 01:58:26,024
All right!
You win, just get out of here.

1036
01:58:26,525 --> 01:58:28,443
Thanks for everything.

1037
01:58:28,986 --> 01:58:30,487
Goodbye.

1038
01:58:30,946 --> 01:58:31,946
Thank you.

1039
01:58:32,114 --> 01:58:33,490
See you soon.

1040
01:58:33,783 --> 01:58:35,533
- Haku!
- Let's go.

1041
01:58:36,202 --> 01:58:37,410
Where's Mom and Dad?

1042
01:58:37,536 --> 01:58:38,828
They went on ahead.

1043
01:58:46,378 --> 01:58:47,462
The water's gone.

1044
01:58:47,630 --> 01:58:49,380
I can't go any further.

1045
01:58:49,799 --> 01:58:52,133
Go back the way you came.

1046
01:58:52,301 --> 01:58:55,386
But don't look back
until you're out of the tunnel.

1047
01:58:55,554 --> 01:58:57,639
But what about you?

1048
01:58:58,057 --> 01:59:00,809
I'll tell Yubaba
I'm quitting my apprenticeship.

1049
01:59:00,976 --> 01:59:03,520
I'm fine now.
I have my name back.

1050
01:59:04,063 --> 01:59:05,855
Now I can go home too.

1051
01:59:05,981 --> 01:59:07,315
Will we meet again somewhere?

1052
01:59:07,483 --> 01:59:08,983
- I'm sure of it.
- Promise?

1053
01:59:09,110 --> 01:59:09,943
Promise.

1054
01:59:10,069 --> 01:59:12,362
Now go, and don't look back.

1055
01:59:35,427 --> 01:59:37,011
Chihiro!

1056
01:59:37,346 --> 01:59:40,014
Where have you been?
Hurry up.

1057
01:59:43,519 --> 01:59:45,353
Mom! Dad!

1058
01:59:45,479 --> 01:59:47,188
Don't go running off like that.

1059
01:59:47,356 --> 01:59:48,356
Let's go.

1060
01:59:49,024 --> 01:59:51,234
Mom, are you really okay?

1061
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:55,613
Hurry, the moving van
will be there.

1062
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:07,250
Hurry up, Chihiro.

1063
02:00:15,968 --> 02:00:17,719
Watch your step.

1064
02:00:17,845 --> 02:00:21,181
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.

1065
02:00:33,402 --> 02:00:34,861
The end of the tunnel.

1066
02:00:35,237 --> 02:00:36,487
Hey!

1067
02:00:36,822 --> 02:00:38,198
What is it?

1068
02:00:38,782 --> 02:00:40,909
Will you look at that.

1069
02:00:41,994 --> 02:00:44,162
It's all dusty inside, too.

1070
02:00:44,580 --> 02:00:46,497
- Is this somebody's joke?
- I wonder...

1071
02:00:46,624 --> 02:00:49,042
I told you not to stop here.

1072
02:00:54,757 --> 02:00:57,258
That's it, you're fine.

1073
02:00:58,510 --> 02:01:00,762
We're off, Chihiro.

1074
02:01:00,888 --> 02:01:03,598
Chihiro! Hurry up!

1075
02:01:04,888 --> 02:01:23,598
